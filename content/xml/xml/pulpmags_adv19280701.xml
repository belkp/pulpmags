His eyes were still glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a result of one of the few intervals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete happiness which life afforded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. There was an admixture of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sheer delight of flying, however.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once he had been a regular Army flyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of merely in the Reserve Corps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a member of that same McMullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of the Border Patrol which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army Air Service flew along the Rio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grande.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he walked toward headquarters, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line of frame buildings on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern edge of the tiny flying field, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost boyish light in his eyes changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the shadow which habitually darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. That he was not still a regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army flyer, he realized, was due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw he had been before his Army days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flying, for him, must always remain an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional treat: just another installment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the payment for his past which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be completed . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lieutenant MacDowell wishes to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, sir, in headquarters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mechanic saluted smartly. Salut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on that small post was a rarity, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause officers and men passed each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">too frequently, but somehow the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">always saluted Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," nodded the Duke, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same moment he saw the tall form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Tex MacDowell appear on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch and start toward him rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He removed his helmet, revealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond hair which lent the last touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyishness to his too perfect face. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear cut features were like those of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">statue. As a matter of fact they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved by plastic surgeons. A wreck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in war days, had almost ruined his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and the artificial one the medicos</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fashioned was as lineless as a boy's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the side he looked twenty-two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three. When one saw his eyes--the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man of thirty-one who had seen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered much--the contrast was such</seg><seg type="columnLine">that few people could ever forget him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Duke," Tex called from twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away, "how'd you like a week end</seg><seg type="columnLine">A COMPLETE NOVELETTE</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to that wild new oil town, Verona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with prospects of excitement?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine," Daly replied, without outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest. Despite himself, he was custom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arily aloof and indifferent. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got a letter from dad. He's in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East and can't get away. He backed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old friend of his, named Henry Ivers, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent partner in an oil machinery business</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there. They got into acreage some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and are getting their eye teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooked out of them by some crook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers don't know what to do, and dad</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants me to go down and look over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and see what can be done. Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a business man, not a rough and tumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">bozo. Dad knew you were here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you might be of help. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right with me," nodded Daly, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the world as if the prospect were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly appealing to him as it was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lean Texan whose eyes were shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">with enthusiasm. "Where is this Verona?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "West of Laredo. They used to call it</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park Forks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ghosts of the past rose, to drop a film</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Daly's eyes and tighten his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was a mask now. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambled along the Rio Grande.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About fifteen miles or so north of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, opposite a little Mexican village</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Santa Verona, isn't it?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex, who knew Daly as no one else in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world did, studied him silently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He started to say something, and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can take a couple or three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, can't you? I mean you aren't liable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get urgent orders from Washington--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly shook his head. For more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years he had been a special Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment agent. His knowledge of the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had made him a valuable one, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had just finished a job here on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Border.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then," grinned Tex, "I vote we</seg><seg type="columnLine">call up Henry Ivers right now and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">started this afternoon, if it's all right</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the captain. He said the trip in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general was O.K, providing we didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">use our official position to further our</seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">private ends, as it were. At that, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">town like Verona we're liable to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">across stuff that'd interest the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment a good deal. Let's go see the cap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hadn't figured on going until tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">until right this minute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MOMENT later they were facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocky, spike pompadoured little</seg><seg type="columnLine">-	Captain Kennard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Cap," grinned the big South-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ener, "anything the matter with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoving off this afternoon to help out my</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor old father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kennard's raucous laughter filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead," he chuckled. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't sleep a wink tonight if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't, and there'd be no use of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">you around the place. Excitement is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease with you, young man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which it was, almost, Daly reflected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Texan seemed to have some per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ennial hunger within him which nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but dangerous emergencies could assuage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A week of monotony, and he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding, temperamental recluse, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor to deaden his senses. The Duke</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what that feeling was--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">always beckoning hijn from around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner--and the invariable disillusion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when one found that it was never so</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive as it seemed. But his own rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness and discontent beat itself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard shell he had built around his real</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and the world rarely knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they went out of the office* an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly ran toward the hangars to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders for their ship. They walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the row of tents which were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living quarters for the dozen officers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol. MacDowell, momentarily serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and faced Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Duke," he drawled. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your mind about this trip? Anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I don't know about? I know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were around the Border as a--a gambler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and might have enemies. I'd like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, so that--you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The commonplace words, said with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of shyness by the Texan, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed the same feeling to Daly which</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell had aroused years before-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The same spirit shone through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made Tex the first and only friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emotionally starved Daly had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. Five years of want, fighting among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dregs of life, years in which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived his mental life alone and displayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world he Jived in and despised a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell which the blows of fate had thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened, had brought to Daly what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to be a totaL self-sufficiency. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell he had found the first under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing friend he had ever had. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutal effort to test him, to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis of his apparent liking for the aloof</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, the Duke had thrown his past in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big fellow's face--hobo, professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler, denizen of the underworld be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he had been made so at fifteen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spared nothing, as though trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">repel the famous flyer whose friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">he really wanted so desperately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Tex had met the test. It had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been Daly's present position of respecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility, even a certain eminence, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted him. For what he had been, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcast, or might be again, meant not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single, solitary damn to MacDowell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inference in his words now sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaccustomed warm glow through Duke</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly, and momentarily his eyes were soft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex wanted to have all the facts, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could fight at Daly's right hand if</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know," Daly said without emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "Remember the case of Jim Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrick, an old coOn he shot--and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell's eyes widened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that was within fifteen miles!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said very slowly. "I don't think it'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean a thing, Duke. If I did I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring you there. Not a soul will connect</seg><seg type="columnLine">you with it--and if they do you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haven't the Fitzpatricks any friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">left since old Dave is in jail?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some--but they're damn' quiet. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't think there's a thing to worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it turned out, there was nothing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Duke to worry about--there. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">5',</seg><seg type="columnLine">was often to discover, however, the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">men do lives after them--and when it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of evil, it seems to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO HOURS later the two flyers</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped their ton-and-&amp;-half De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haviland into the airdrome of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Border Patrol flight at Laredo. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifteen minutes the gas and oil tanks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been refilled, and they were in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Considerable information regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the town of Verona had also come</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way from the flyers. If evidence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed of the fact that -an oil boom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed conditions along that part [of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">border, the Duke thought to himself, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look from the air supplied it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laredo was the nearest railroad ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minus, and that sizeable town had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed considerably since last he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen it. Close to the railroad station</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaunt frame warehouses had arisen like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms, and the streets of the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">were crowded. The one road which led</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the rolling mesquite was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight to see. It crawled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaparral like a gray snake, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded with vehicles of all descriptions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from huge trucks to §mall wagons drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">by burros. It was rutted so deeply as to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be almost impassable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was not a break in the clogged</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic between Laredo and Verona.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly felt a thrill as, from five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, he looked down on the newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">created town. It looked almost like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gargantuan circus lot, because tempo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarily it seemed to be built of canvas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hundreds of tents of all sizes lined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main road, and side streets had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacked from the mesquite. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many crude shacks of all sizes, and foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths were lined with eVery species of</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporary structure, from pup tents to</seg><seg type="columnLine">square, steel roofed frame buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Around what had evidently been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original cross roads, with its small cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of permanent buildings, was the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Verona was a tent city, almost a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">square already, and here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mesquite there were isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusters of tents. The streets were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed with people that the circus</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusion grew on him. No midway, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before show time, had ever been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">densely populated. From the air it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that a man could have crossed any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crude streets on the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly moving vehicles. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalks, and what were called streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see, were merely trails, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part, and those trails had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">gored by thousands of wheels until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like freshly plowed fields. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles and trucks were stalled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others were barely able to move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh! If it ever rains not a wheel will</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn for days!" he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the town as a nucleus, dozens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">zigzag trails, hewn from the chaparral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snaked away in all directions. Derricks</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust themselves from the mesquite on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides. Pipeline gangs were working</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there, and every road was full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicles. Jets of steam showed whitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many places to indicate where drilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going on, and here and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">large areas which were blackened with oil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw a half dozen sumps, the oil show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing black inside them, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozens of others being dug. Transpor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation was so difficult, doubtless, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">storage tanks would be the last things</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His heart leaped to the thrill of the raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of it all. It was as though he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching men at grips with Mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature herself, wringing her riches from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her against overwhelming odds. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an effect of tremendous struggle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slowness with which the wagons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trucks moved. The gaunt derricks, in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">stages of construction, seemed more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage than like usable pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery. Drillers, roughnecks, pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">line men, and laborers swariped over an</seg><seg type="columnLine">area of three or four square miles like busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, and the town was like a teeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant hill. Stuck out there in the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wilderness, with every bit of food, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say nothing of machinery, transport-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed from fifty miles away, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievable. It was crude and ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sublime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell turned around, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing through his goggles. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of the town, and Daly nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a clearing there, and one air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was standing in front of a canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex, who was flying, nosed the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and sent it into a tight spiral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly above the town. Now Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that derricks were being con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed within the limits of the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment itself. The white city was studded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. A quarter of a mile east of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verona a closely set group of derricks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their boilers already in operation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roughnecks busy on the drilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">floors, indicated the original well. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the derricks were black with oil, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge sump was half full. From this as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">center the derricks spread in a circle, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest of them growing thinner and thin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner as the circumference of the circle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly shifted his attention to the field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was small for a De Haviland, and spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it testified to the fact that stumps had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pulled from its surface. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it presented no problems to a flyer like</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced southward. Santa Verona,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexico, was in view on the bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. Opposite it, on the American side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small settlement looked like a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuation of the Mexican town. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">river was all of fifteen miles away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two towns combined looked no</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger than a man's hand. That had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place where a certain tragedy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened ten years before, and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment Daly's mind brooded over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as the twelve cylinder Liberty's</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar decreased, and he felt the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind against his right cheek which indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated a sideslip, he transferred his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the ground underneath him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of town was but two miles away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he glanced at it he thought:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seems as though there was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement about us, at that! That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny -- they're used to airplanes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did seem that every living soul had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped whatever he might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, and was watching the big bomber</seg><seg type="columnLine">come down. Tex had it sideslipping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right wing down. A hundred feet high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little- more than two hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of tHe field he brought it level, cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun completely, and glided toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearing. One solitary man stood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the civilian ship, watching, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the derrick floors of the wells close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field Daly could see that all work had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. Four men on horseback were</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding into the field as Tex brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">DH down on three points. It stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling fifty feet from the hangar, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they taxied up alongside the civilian ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four horsemen rode to meet them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The solitary man who had been stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing alongside the ship went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny way for a flyer to act," thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He transferred his attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsemen. They were lined up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, and as the De Haviland stopped roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and they could control their horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">better, they rode around on the side of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell turned off the gas, and Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">.climbed out while the motor was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horsemen dismounted silently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One man held the reins of all four horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the other three walked toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The welcoming committee," drawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex in his ear, and then said aloud:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howdy. This is Verona, I take it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're not our guards for the ship, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" The man ignored the last ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shore is. Stayin' long?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speaker was a very small, dried up</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man of about forty-five, Duke esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated, and he was slightly ahead of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions. He was bowlegged, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore expensive field boots instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy boots which would have seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in keeping with his appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riding breeches of whipcord, a wellmade</seg><seg type="columnLine">flannel shirt, and an ornate sombrero</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had not cost a ccnt less than sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars completed his costume. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weatherbeaten until it was a mahogany</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, and two very cold, very keen green</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes looked speculatively at the flyers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were narrowed, and there were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million wrinkles around them.- His nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">was long, and jutted forth boldly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">a neatly trimmed mustache. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious contrast--the clothes of a dandy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the appearance of an old time cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">puncher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Just a couple of days," Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the other two men laughed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tall and lean and dark faced, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips looked to be the kind which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist easily into a sneer. He was dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloppily, his clothes spotted with oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yo're plannin' to stay that long? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the little leader again, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flitted from one face to the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a challenge in his soft voice--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of metallic ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly looked at him in amazement at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," he stated evenly, "would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be our business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader's face did not change, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other two men chuckled. Not a par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly mirthful chuckle, Daly decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rising interest. The third man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">short and powerfully built, a disreputable</seg><seg type="columnLine">sombrero cocked on one side of his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and making his scarred face look some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what tougher than it would have ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty cocky, eh, Newt?" he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired, and the leader turned on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep yore trap shut!" he said softly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the trap was shut without argument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yo're Border Patrolmen, ain't yuh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked quietly, and those eyes were like</seg><seg type="columnLine">gimlets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," nodded Tex. "But we're just</seg><seg type="columnLine">here on a visit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader expectorated a large quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tity of tobacco juice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hell yuh say," he drawled. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice yuh brought yore guns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes were on the machine guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were mounted on the ship. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">two companions drifted around the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, as though looking it over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell was leaning negligently</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the side of the fuselage, his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing with his Colt idly. Daly saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flame suddenly. His drawl was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow when he finally spoke, but the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals were flying. Something in the a t-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude of the outwardly inoffensive little</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider had aroused Daly's gorge, as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what the hell of it?" MacDowell</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger's eyes flitted from Daly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">to MacDowell's. He walked forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. The other two men, out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of the ship, made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. As he came forward the rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed his sombrero far back on his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Duke could see more of his face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a lantern jaw, hollow, creased cheeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those eyes, seen more plainly, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very wintry looking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plenty of it, Mr. Patrolman!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that harsh timbre suddenly obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. "You wasn't sent for, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. We're not here on business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you said. I'm tellin' you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin'. You better go. Verona don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. We can handle our own affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here, and don't need no help from</seg><seg type="columnLine">outsiders!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly could scarcely believe his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took a step forward, glancing mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly at Tex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, stranger," he said in that cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">detached voice of his, "we didn't ask you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any advice. And we expect to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as we damn' please. We told you we</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't here on duty, but whether we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not is none of your business. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">since you've mentioned it, who the hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave you any authority to speak for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verona?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yo're pretty cocky, you boys, ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" drawled the Verona man con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuously. "I'm jest tellin' you two</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. We're havin' a special election</seg><seg type="columnLine">t'morrow, and I'm one o' the candidates</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the job o' runnin' this town. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't crave yore help. We don't want no</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn' airplane buzzin around, with guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it, nor no Rangers nor Border Patrol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men nor anybody else hornin' in t' help</seg><seg type="columnLine">us run our business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly's mind took in the import of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's words almost unconsciously as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought of the possibilities in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're not here to run your business,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex told him easily. "But now that we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the subject, why are you so keen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we leave here? We came down for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacation--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it looks as though we might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some work to do and could start in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly said that quietly. Somehow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal side of the situation did not seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">so important. He felt a vague resent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at the idea of this bandylegged</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Southwesterner taking it upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to insult the Government in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR A long ten seconds the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Westerner's eyes held Daly's, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were very cold and keen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he finally spoke, Daly, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for anything^ was almost shocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tenor of his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We ain't gettin' nowhere thisaway,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rider said, conciliation in his voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His two comrades were standing by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail surfaces of the ship, now, whispering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to themselves. Duke could see them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the corner of his eye. "Now, listen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ain't here t' get in bad with you boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor t' tell you what t' do. Don't git me</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. Here's the situation. Verona's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny town with a funny problem. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim t' run it ourselves. Right at this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ain't askin' or wantin' no outside in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terference. We don't want no outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops, sheriffs, Rangers or whatnot runnin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">around hog wild, arrestin' the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and raisin' hell generally. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">here's a bunch o' men got together from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smackover t' Tampico. It ain't even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">town yet. We aim t' organize our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">law and run our own show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it's liable t' be very, very tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur anybody from the outside t' horn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet awhile. They ain't needed or wanted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nobody could tell what'd happen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why the hell should you want t' butt in?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honest, I'm doin' you a favor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks to me," Daly said calmly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"as though Verona was threatening any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, including us, who interfered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger looked long and hard at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Duke. He rolled and lit a cigaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">with absentminded skill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name's Jed Conklin," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. "I own acreage, am drillin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">wells, and got a heavy investment here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's only one way t' run a boom town</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this here one, which come up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin'. I aim t' have my money pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected the best way. I ain't goin' into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in detail. But I'm askin' you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated. It seemed to Daly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fundamental nastiness of temper--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience which he had kept repressed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly was rising to the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jed Conklin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In fact, I'm tellin' yuh tuh mind yore</seg><seg type="columnLine">own business while yuh're here for yore</seg><seg type="columnLine">own good! Keep yore hands off this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose we say we'll do as we damn'</seg><seg type="columnLine">please?" drawled MacDowei!.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, ho, ho! Why, you old fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a shout of laughter from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter of the Conklin henchmen. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave vent to those apparently hilarious</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, he smote the taller man a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow on the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Daly it seemed that there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lack of spontaneity in the laugh, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taller man stumbled forward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the blow had been from a pile-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver. Half by instinct and half because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an idea which had suddenly assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">form in his mind, Daly leaped toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The elevators of the De Haviland, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, were hanging, their rear edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">within inches of the ground. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verona man was falling toward them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly covered the eight feet between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and the stranger in one bound. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oil man's heavy boot was coming down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one elevator the flyer's fist crashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw with all the momentum of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap plus the skill which was the result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a hundred fights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The oil man staggered back, his foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushing the linen of the control harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You would, would you!" Daly snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped coolly, and another blow to the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jaw felled the astounded Texan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, damn you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smaller man had jumped at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Daly jumped backward with catlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickness. His Colt was out before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't anybody move!" came Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell's vibrant voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His gun was out, too, trained on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conklin. Daly, his gun on the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">henchman, and his eyes on his fallen foe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke very clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trying to make sure our ship'll stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground, by putting it out of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission, are you?" he inquired coolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Conklin, this is a very interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">party--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the hell do you mean! Put them</seg><seg type="columnLine">popguns up, you squirts!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The faded little Southwesterner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly boiling with rage. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakelike, and his .leathery face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working with emotion he could no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d'yuh mean, soakin' that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">thataway?" he rushed on furiously. "By</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, if you think yore uniforms is gonna</seg><seg type="columnLine">git you anything in this here town you</seg><seg type="columnLine">got another think cornin'! Gun play you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want, huh? We'll blow the top o' yore</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads off, you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was MacDowell. He moved forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly and clapped his hand oyer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irate oil man's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen here," Daly cut in steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His victim was still on the ground, dazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the little fat man seemed entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonplussed. "Your two men here de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately framed up a dodge to put our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship out of commission. Maybe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew about it, and maybe you didn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It strikes me as a very peculiar thing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a respectable citizen to come out here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threaten officers and warn them not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere, and put their official equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of order. We ought to carry the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you into town and put you in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lockup for attempted destruction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government property and interference</seg><seg type="columnLine">with officers of the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we won't, now. We're not here</seg><seg type="columnLine">on duty--supposedly. But the property</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ship is standing on is protected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government right now, and it starts</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet from the ship on all sides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now get the hell off that property!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fast!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a fleeting second the Southwest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erner stood immobile, his face a study in</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffled fury. Something in the Duke's</seg><seg type="columnLine">passionless tones bound his tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, and he did not speak. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted to the eyes of MacDowell, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him. Without a word he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked away from the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come on, you two," Daly said</seg><seg type="columnLine">tersely. "If the big boy can't walk, carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Fatty!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fatty supported his partner, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not too dazed to mumble curses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's some news you might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread," called MacDowell. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged for a couple of guards, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders from now on'll be to shoot anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">that passes the dead line. Get that, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conklin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Conklin did not answer. As two</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsemen rode into the field he and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">henchmen rode away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell, his eyes shining with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zest of the battle, lit a cigaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've seen dumb things, and peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, and what have you," he stated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I'll be damned if I ever saw any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't get it at all," Daly admitted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Great God, Tex, no man could be such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool as to come right out and tip his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand if he was up to something criminal!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conklin comes right to us, and warns us</seg><seg type="columnLine">in plain terms to keep out of things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any dumbbell in the world would know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a man who did that was up to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing illegal--and any dumbbell would</seg><seg type="columnLine">know too much to do it if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any reason to be scared of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might figure he acted in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith for the good of Verona," Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruminated. "Lots of these towns don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want law in the ordinary sense. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">want women and booze and six-shooter</seg><seg type="columnLine">law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I'll be damned if they try to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroy Government property and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately alienate officers of the law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It might be that those two bozos</seg><seg type="columnLine">originated the idea themselves, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big boy had little to do with it," Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possible, but not probable. Here are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two roughly dressed, stubbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded riders dismounted leisurely, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavier of the two inquired--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "MacDowell and Daly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right. You're the guards Mr. Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, suh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both men were armed, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly competent for a job which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the last few moments, had assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know Jed Conklin?" Daly asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shore do," said the smaller man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping his mustache with the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He just tried to put this ship out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission. Looks as though some</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in this town didn't want it to fly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So you may have work to do. The orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">are this. Put up stakes in a circle twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away from the ship, and shoot if any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body tries to get closer. You're guarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government property now," Daly told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them quietly;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was watching the guards closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they showed no signs of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's funny," the tall one said</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruminatively, scratching his incipient</seg><seg type="columnLine">goatee. "Must be this here election's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonna be a humdinger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darkness was falling, and Daly could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no reason for questioning the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">further when more information could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained from Ivers. They were to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard's horses. As they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them Tex remarked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a good ship there. Looks like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Robin's Cruiser to me. Notice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liberty? It is a Cruiser."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly nodded. The ship was a heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, thick winged model, with space for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers in the front seat. The pilot's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit was the rear one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She'll do about what the DH will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't she?" he inquired absently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh huh--a little more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They mounted, and as they were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way across the field Tex remarked:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't see why an election should</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it necessary for a ship to be put out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of order. If we planned to interfere, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't do any good in the air. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you make of that, Watson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who can tell what's up in a town like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this only ten miles from the river? Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you figure, furthermore, that it's a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar for that man who was alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship when we were coming down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear and fail to extend greetings to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow flyers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex grinned blissfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably all a pipe dream," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled. "But it doesn't hurt to hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something might happen, does it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've made a great start. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful men of the town hates us al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready, and we've got an unknown guy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight for the honor and money of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family. This election, by all signs, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean quite a fruity day tomorrow. All in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, Duke, my boy, I'm glad to be among</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big Texan was in his private idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the seventh heaven. Daly smiled, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes momentarily warm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not sorry," he said evenly. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, I'm not too sorry that this Conklin</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap has got me thoroughly and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely bewildered. He may be anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">from just a dunce to an outlaw so sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that he thinks he can run the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Border Patrol as well as Verona."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That'll probably be cleaned up in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds after we talk to Ivers," Tex said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Say, wouldn't it be a joke if he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bozo who was rooking dad?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY struck the main trail--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could'not be called a road--half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile from the field. It was choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with traffic of all descriptions. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines moved at a snail's pace, except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">lone riders who galloped through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mesquite. The ruts were often a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep. Wagons and trucks laden with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe and other equipment; passenger cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying scouts, drillers, and mechanics;</seg><seg type="columnLine">tool pushers; food trucks--all were part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line. At intervals of a few hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards other roads branched off to wells or</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospective wells on either side. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many vehicles stuck in the sand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was an effect of mighty effort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweaty industry. The fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift Texas darkness had fallen seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make no difference to the throng of</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers. Before the night was over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers were to make certain of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that work in the Verona field went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four hours a day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We don't seem to be too popular,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are," agreed Tex as they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the town. "Listen to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bozo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of a group of men riding a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck had called tauntingly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The reformers are with us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many of the curious glances they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived were far from friendly. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times what amounted to insults were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled at them from the protection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These roughnecks don't want their fun</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoiled," Daly commented. "They think</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're the law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they came into the outskirts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town the feeling grew in strength. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of the road solid lines of pedes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trians were moving toward town be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween lines of tents and shacks. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers were conspicuous, and even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained Daly felt self-conscious as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">became the center of attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at the Boy Scouts!" was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite remark from the oil spotted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crudely dressed men on either side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their passage down the street became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ordeal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before it was over Tex had a dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">glint in his eye, and Daly himself was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightlipped and ready for trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They haven't even got electric lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">in most places yet," Tex observed as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into the main street. "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord, what a sight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Daly agreed with him. Flaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">torches made the street as light as day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flickering shadows in the background</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent it an air of spookiness. The street</seg><seg type="columnLine">was solid with slow moving traffic, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadbed a rough sea of ruts and sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bogs. Four lines of traffic barely moved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tents alternated with unpainted tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porary buildings, and there were dozens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of other structures on which work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressing feverishly. And everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were men--sliding between cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking the sidewalks, so thick that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely room for their feet. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side there came music of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">known variety--hand organ, mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">pianos, personally operated violins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guitars, and a few portable organs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most of these places are dives, it looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me," observed Tex. "Look at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">place!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a huge frame structure, entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">open on the street side. Inside it a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar extended all along the right hand side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ten bartenders were busy attending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mob which fought to get a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the counter. A good many tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied the remainder of the front part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building, and there were quite a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, plainly hostesses, helping oil men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend their money. In the rear was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small dance floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Taunts, some humorous and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasty, were hurled continuously at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers. It was a seething tent city, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young, raw giant bellowing to the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Daly felt a sense of surging life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and his heart beat faster. Anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">could happen there. Drunkenness, a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon were in the very air. The crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could look down upon included</seg><seg type="columnLine">every type of man, from dirty roughneck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to well dressed big company scout, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprinkling of women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Every Mexican gold digger from</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tampico north must have flocked here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told Tex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are more spigs than Americans</seg><seg type="columnLine">■--and there are a lot of 'em among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They sure aren't secret about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">good times," Daly said, half to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look at this street!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost every building and tent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide open on the street side. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were lighted with electricity, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">by kerosene or gasoline, and the solid line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brightly illuminated squares gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carnival effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'd like to see ten square feet of space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside or outside, with nobody occupying</seg><seg type="columnLine">it," Tex remarked. "Look at that sign.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cots ten bucks a night, huh? Say, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers and Dad don't clean up here I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where they ever will. Let's ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Verona Machinery Equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Co. has its place of business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaned down and asked a man in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge sombrero who was walking along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him. Pedestrians were in the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing between buildings, everywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than ever the town was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded circus lot, even to many loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">ballyhoo artists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man looked up, showing a face so</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark that he might have been a Mexican.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he took in Tex's uniform his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened, and a smile overspread his</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That big building--frame--on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand side," he said, pointing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are Mr. MacDowell!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" asked the surprised Tex as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man hesitated. "Do I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked long at the two flyers, grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning as though at a private joke. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed his hat back on his head, walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">along beside the horses. His hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond. He was thin faced and lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">jawed, and his eyes sloped upward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose, giving his face a certain oriental</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast. It was subtly cruel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew Mr. Ivers was expecting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of flyers," he said. "Hope jyou</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a good time. So long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned, and fought his way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd.	iF1*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That bozo acted as though he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying our being here," Tex stated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe he's one of Ivers' men. Say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke, this town is the damnedest place I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever hit. A pilot runs away from meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, the next guy gets in a fight with us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two bozos try to wreck the plane, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bunch in general would be far happier</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we weren't here. Maybe I'm getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous, but this last gink, the first one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak politely, acted as though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the principal ingredient in a Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">holiday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly smiled briefly. He had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely anesthetic to the curious, often</seg><seg type="columnLine">belligerent, looks from the crowds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frequent razzings which came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He certainly was having a laugh to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Looked as though he might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a halfbreed. You don't suppose Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">confided in him, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll soon tell," drawled Tex, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off his horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big two story building, constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unpainted boards, had two small</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows and one door in its fifty foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">front. Painted on its front in crude letter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was the name of the company. On one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of it was a huge square tent which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a barroom and dance hall. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was a low, flat roofed frame struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture which was closed to the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sounds of high revel came from it, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and streams of men were passing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out its wide door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They led their horses down the alley</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside the Ivers building. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a platform for loading machinery toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear of the building. They tied their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses, and came around to go in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A group of men were talking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small space in front of a counter. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the counter long lines of shelves</seg><seg type="columnLine">held all sorts of tools, and further to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear heavy machinery could be seen--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps and other oil equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where can we find Mr. Ivers?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The six men looked the two flyers over</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely. Finally one of them jerked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger toward a stairway on one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Upstairs," he said briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they mounted the stairs Daly heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">them whispering more or less excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We certainly do create attention," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Tex. "Damned if I'm not beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe there's something more here</seg><seg type="columnLine">than meets the eye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we are!" stated MacDowell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AT THE front of the floor, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainly given up to the storage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets, cots, and lighter equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, was a partition which extended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full width of the building. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two doors, one marked "office". It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and Daly could see a very fat man</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending over a desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Mr. Ivers," Tex said from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, and the man turned around</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lumbered to his feet, and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. His fat face expanded in a smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes receded to mere pinpoints as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh gathered around them. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald headed, and wore eyeglasses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have weighed a full three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds, Duke thought. He was six</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet tall, at least, and about that big</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Mr. Daly," Tex introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Ivers' grip was hard and firm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, well, it's been fifteen years since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've seen you, Lee," Ivers remarked as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled a bottle from his desk and took out</seg><seg type="columnLine">some tumblers. "Have a drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly had a sudden shock as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers in profile. The fat, jovial counte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nance seemed to change. His nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved slightly, and his cheekbones were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very high. He 'seemed almost with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out eyes, from the side, too. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strength and aggressiveness in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">profile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he turned to pass them the drinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not smiling. Because of the layers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fat around his eyes they gave the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gray slits of light set very far back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, peering forth from protecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh. It was like another and vastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different personality, wearing that body</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's sure looking me over plenty,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers was darting quick looks at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly, while talking personalities</seg><seg type="columnLine">with MacDowell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mr. Ivers," Tex said finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Duke here and I have our ears out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot to find out what the hell's up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">why we're here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers leaned back in his chair, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded over his huge paunch. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence in the barren office. Its only</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture was the desk, three straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, and a filing cabinet. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street came the ceaseless drone of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">milling crowds, shot through with music</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ribald laughter and shouting. Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quiet and at ease, and he smoked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret with his eyes on the ceiling as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt Ivers' eyes boring into him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Lee," Ivers said' finally, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed assistance because I've been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">business man all my life and I realize my</seg><seg type="columnLine">limitations. First, the general situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know pretty well. This is unique</seg><seg type="columnLine">among oil towns because there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus of a town here--no substantial</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized local element. It's a collection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of six or seven thousand hardbitten oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, adventurers, highjackers, and thugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">both male and female, thrown together</seg><seg type="columnLine">from half a dozen oil centers. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">organization, but there will be one to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. In general, it's dog eat dog, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every man for himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He talks like an educated man," Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought as he listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers' voice was throaty, almost wheezy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his words were pronounced clearly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly, and with deliberation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now then," Ivers went on, "I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of the field before the first well</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in. I laid my plans for this busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and got half of the capital from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. When the first well hit I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of trucks on the way, machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped the next day, and was installed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this building almost before the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew there was a boom. And a right tidy</seg><seg type="columnLine">business it is, too. There isn't a dollar's</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth of goods on these floors that isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold, and there are carloads on the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were sold before they were shipped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wasn't satisfied, though. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">something I seldom do, with your father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval. Of course you know that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have done business, as partners and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponents both, for twenty-five years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old hellion has beat me out of a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune when we were against each other!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think he trusts my judgment, however.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I invested twenty-two thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us both in acreage, all bought from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexicans and negroes in small lots. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took out a blueprint of the field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was divided into a thousand areas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and large, and he pointed to a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion north east of town which was plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked, "Ivers' acreage".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looked good then, and wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," Ivers continued. "The first well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer Number 1, was a mile away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the fault formation and all indica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions pointed to it being good stuff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer himself had corraled all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">acreage around his wildcat. Another well</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being sunk, offset from our acreage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was proving up. Since then--it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas Number l,*here--it's come in for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand barrels of high grade oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right now this acreage, leased at from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty to two hundred dollars an acre, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth in round numbers from a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">an acre up. There are wells in, or looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, all around it. Not thirty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel ones, but good ones. I should say</seg><seg type="columnLine">your dad's holdings and mine could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold tomorrow for a hundred thousand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does look as though you were a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">business man," Tex observed. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just this. As I said, this acreage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased, got on option, and otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured from individual Mexican and</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro farmers, all ignorant. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation is this: Derringer--Slats Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer, driller of the original well--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared and forced and bribed these twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">small owners to swear that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced by my agents to sell their leases--</seg><seg type="columnLine">coerced into deals they didn't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make. Every damn' one of them has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced by Derringer to repudiate their</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreements with me, and to make new</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, at a slightly higher price with a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">percentage of the profits, to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well I'll be damned," Tex said softly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at the immobile Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly was listening closely, but said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see where we are. Twenty-two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand sunk. If those landholders</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick to their story, the land will event-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually belong to Derringer, and we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck. He'll fight forever, and has' (he</seg><seg type="columnLine">money to do it. The best that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen is to have it go years in the courts</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and everybody lose. As far as profits</seg><seg type="columnLine">are concerned, we're tied tighter than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum. By the time it's settled, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's in our favor, we'll have spent thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands, the pool will probably be drained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the oil under our property will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeped away and produced from offset</seg><seg type="columnLine">wells. Any way you take it, we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is this Derringer, and how does</seg><seg type="columnLine">he get away with it?" asked Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There," stated Mr. Ivers impressively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is the nub of the whole proposition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's the man we've got to tangle with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took out a stogie, and lighted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with deliberation. He settled back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ch?ir again, and started talking directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slats Derringer has been a big driller</seg><seg type="columnLine">for years--sometimes twenty rigs in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. He's made a lot of money, one way</seg><seg type="columnLine">or another, and he's the smartest inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent oil operator this far south. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in here from Mexico and drilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wildcat. He started tying up acre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age before he brought her in. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did that, that was my cue to get ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for business. That's what I think of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No sooner had he hit oil than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought into this town about five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred men he knew. Most of 'em had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked for him. Others were friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had roughnecks, [drillers, dive keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers--a Derringer mob gathered from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen fields and former boom towns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's got money himself, and I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Dallas men are backing him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit. There seems to be no limit to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The result of all this is easy to see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before this town was well under way</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer owned more than half the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking acreage, bought for a song, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his organized mob, growing every day</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running things. We've got no</seg><seg type="columnLine">officials yet, nominally, but actually Slats</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs the works. He isn't particular about</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, either. If he wants machinery, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes it, pays for it, although it's price-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less at this time, and asks the real owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the hell he's going to do about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His friends own the principal dives--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other saloon keepers are liable to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">their places of business wrecked if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't throw in on Derringer's side. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow he'll be elected chief cook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottlewasher of the town, be the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vigilantes or whatever the law'll be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be officially in office. He is the high •</seg><seg type="columnLine">muckymuck, the political boss, the rich-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est man, the most active driller, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biggest owner of acreage, and all the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the works. I'm telling you the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I say that I* have been forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him machinery which was sold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody else three times. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold out once--and that was enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He sounds," drawled Tex, "like what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be called a worthy foeman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And a crooked one. He's the boy that</seg><seg type="columnLine">owns our acreage now. Naturally those</seg><seg type="columnLine">negroes and spigs are scared to death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. There isn't a chance that they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever throw in on our--the right--</seg><seg type="columnLine">side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He aims to be the king of the field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh?" asked Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly. And he will be. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">companies are watching, waiting a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer for the field to prove itself, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping in and taking it over. Slats Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer wants to be kingpin of a field in</seg><seg type="columnLine">full operation, from pumping stations to</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading racks, and to turn it over for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy few million and retire, I guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has ambitions to be a new oil king,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I guess he will be. It's a cinch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll take his pick of everything--and any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he wants and can't get will be quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a burden to its owner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tex got to his feet as though im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient for action. His brown hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually neatly parted, was now down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes and he pushed it back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, where do we come in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the first place, there's no use right</seg><seg type="columnLine">now of even thinking of bucking Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer. There wouldn't be a chance. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am outwardly good friends with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing off what he's done by the old oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">field motto of getting away with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can. I acknowledge myself out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witted, so to speak, and he is one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">best customers, of course. Any day, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, he'll be around to take over this</seg><seg type="columnLine">business and hire me to run it for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wait and see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, I do think that we ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do this. Get at least a part of our legiti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate profit out of the acreage, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way or other and then sell it to him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we paid for it--which he's willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give. And it's worth a hundred thousand!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is, he'll give the original owners the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, if they need it, to return your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and me what we paid them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped talking, and took a medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tative drag on his cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I forgot to mention another string to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bow," he went on finally. "He also</seg><seg type="columnLine">owns the biggest gambling house in town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right next door here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those impersonal eyes were suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming as they rested on the Duke's</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotionless countenance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He sure has got this town tied up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex drawled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is, he backs it," Ivers said. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler named Draw One Donnelly, last</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Smackover, runs it for him. Oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated in Tia Juana and Havana before</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting the oilfields. But I know abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely that it's Derringer's money. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting the dinero out of this field from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all directions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I don't know. That's why</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're here. When I give you proof of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Derringer has openly robbed us</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seventy-five thousand dollars, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably you'll agree with me that we needn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be too honest about our own methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting it back. As a matter of fact, he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crook every way. Even his gambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">games--when there are big players--are</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Tex threw back his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. Daly grinned, and Ivers per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted himself a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that from a friend of mine who</seg><seg type="columnLine">got taken for plenty. When a man or</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, new rich oil men or whoever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be, are live wires who want to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">real poker with no limit, they're taken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a private room where a house man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly himself, presides. There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">always enough men to make up the game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two men--Donnelly and a confederate</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the sucker does not know is a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">federate--are sure to be there. If there</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't any other customers--and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually are, a couple of supposed custom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers wander in. They're house men too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The net of the proposition is that any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is playing against from two to four</seg><seg type="columnLine">men working together--raising and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising each other and all that. It won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you ten minutes, with this tip, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover the truth of it yourselves. Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer himself takes a hand--he loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">poker. He's as crooked as his house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whenever he isn't too busy he spends his</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenings that way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He sure is a versatile boy," Tex said</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely is," agreed Ivers. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perhaps you fellows might like to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the gambing house, play a while, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">look Derringer over. I've got a telegram</seg><seg type="columnLine">here from your father--he realizes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may have to spend money to get our</seg><seg type="columnLine">money back--saying that he'll put up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of whatever amount I decide is</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary. We'll pretend that you're able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose plenty--and let you size up Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer, prove to yourselves he's a damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook, and--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, listen," Tex interrupted, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent Daly could see he was afire with</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. "Suppose we do that. Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose we prove to ourselves that he's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked card player as well as a crook</seg><seg type="columnLine">every other way. Duke, what's wrong in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fighting fire with fire, and crooking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him right back? Gj^ln there and play</seg><seg type="columnLine">square poker, of course, losing money</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately until we're sure we're being</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooked. Then go right back at 'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment there was silence. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers leaned forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a possible idea," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisply. "And I'm calculating on risking</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand dollars for my share. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">check is good for twenty, to make up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill's share. Maybe more--say fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand a piece. I don't know--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he's so powerful, it seems like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best way to me!" MacDowell said slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"After, of course, we're dead certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're only fighting fire with fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a queer feeling within Daly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For some reason he could not accept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation as anything but totally unreal--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dream. Suddenly he leaned forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Ivers, would you be willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust the playing of all that money to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex and me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers played with his watch chain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not look up as he replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His father thinks Tex a fine poker</seg><seg type="columnLine">player, and you have that reputation--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"From whom?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers raised his eyes. Daly was tense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"From Tex, originally, and from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly relaxed slightly. Then Ivers did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know that, he had been forced into</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked gambling, years before, by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man, when starvation was close</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. And that he had been one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most successful of the card men, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of his youth and breeding. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he laughed at himself. How could Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">know anything like that?</seg><seg type="columnLine">"ARE THESE them Army officers?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">/-A It was a voice from the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. A tall, very thin, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard looking man, his blond hair-tousled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his chin covered with a thin beard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing there. His hard gray eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on Ivers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Iversanswered, studying theman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got a note for you," the stranger in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the flyers, and handed it to Daly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was nearest hun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was brief and w'the point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Mind your own business and don't interfere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  with anything while you're in this town. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  long as you do that, you'll be all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly handed it to Ivers, his eyes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger. As the man started to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly jumped forward. He spun the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger around, and their faces were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">close together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who sent that note?" he demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was told not to tell," grinned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man impudently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you will tell--now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roughneck pushed his hair back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his eyes. His gimlet eyes gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sardonic mirth as he repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">mockingly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I won't tell--now. None of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">business. I'm jest a messenger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly's mind was made up in a split</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. What was on the schedule for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verona during the next twenty-four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not know. He did know that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resented, personally and officially, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude of Verona toward himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex. And that the more they knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better they would be off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the bearer of the threat turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go, a mocking grin on his bony face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly, tight lipped but self-controlled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun him around again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, who do you think--" the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">started nastily, but he stopped suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A Colt was pressed against his shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Daly's gray eyes were not easy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look into.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're going to tell what you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now," Daly said with an equanimity</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was more venomous than rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been. "You're going to do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">within thirty seconds. If you don't, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to shoot you right through that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder of yours. If you don't tell then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're going to be taken to Laredo, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweated until you do. You're not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get out of this room alone. This may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be Verona, but we're not afraid of you or</seg><seg type="columnLine">your boss. Now, damn you, think while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I count ten!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly was utterly sincere, and he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt of what he meant to do. Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as though paralyzed. Tex, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind Daly, said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly Daly counted. The man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockiness disappeared like magic. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a rat in a trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the count reached five, very slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes remained frozen to Daly's. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven his mouth was open, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation in his eyes. At nine the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">exorable Daly, mouth a thin, cruel line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was snarling the word down into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At ten I shoot," he said quietly, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here goes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't shoot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's nerve broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was Jed Conklin and Barny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Opper!" he half shouted. "They told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring it here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why? Do you know? Talk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man looked as though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to pet a house cat, and it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into a lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jed Conklin!" Ivers said slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's he up to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," the man said earnestly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Except that there's somethin' up."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tomorrow?" demanded Tex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, tonight! Does that satisfy you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's all I know. Lemme go now, huh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd git killed by Barny Opper if he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead," Daly told him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man left, head down in humiliation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Couldn't depend on the truth of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, anyhow," Daly commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. "I guess I did the right thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Conklin, it appears, had important</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans afoot, and our safety is none too</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, Tex. Know him, Mr. Ivers?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," Ivers said absently. He got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began pacing the floor thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's Derringer's only rival, and about</seg><seg type="columnLine">half as strong. He wants to run the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. He hasn't got a chance. Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">has stolen his stuff, and fought him tooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nail to drive him to the wall. Jed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might say, represents the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">element, although nobody likes him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nasty chap--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's sure acting very funny," Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked. "As though he was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull off a big job. Listen to this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Tex told briefly the events of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon which concerned Conklin, Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood motionless, his fat legs spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">widely and his face without a trace of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression. The flesh seemed to fold more</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly around his eyes, however, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">that impression of a stranger looking forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the flesh which disguised him became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more powerful than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When MacDowell had finished Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched his head absently. Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that he was much more im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed than he seemed to be. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying a word he made one slow turn of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, his head down in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jed's got something up his sleeve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure as hell," he said finally in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">throaty wheeze. He seemed to be trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to digest the possibilities in the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, most of this town don't give</seg><seg type="columnLine">a damn. There are two organized mino-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rities--Derringer's and Jed's. Derrin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger's is stronger. The rest of the town'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">just be satisfied with whatever happens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jed aims to have things happen this way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's got a coup prepared, and he wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">no law in the shape of patrolmen, or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other brand of it. Well, I'll be damned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So the little rooster's laid a trap of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ceased talking, and resumed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. Daly thought that he was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably exercised over the situation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who had little interest one way or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course he has--he hates Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer," he reminded himself. Aloud he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny situation, isn't it? Here you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate Derringer and we're planning to rook</seg><seg type="columnLine">him plenty. At the same time, we're in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of feud with our principal ally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he doesn't know it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers nodded, his fleshy face blank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," he said abruptly. "Let's get</seg><seg type="columnLine">set on this poker business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down, but his heart did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to be in the project as it had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just for your own information," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said absently, "here are the papers show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Bill and I the legal owners of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">acreage. Within ten or fifteen minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll find the game crooked. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Daly and Tex examined the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually. There was no doubt of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuineness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," Ivers said, "how do you plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work things? As I said, I'm a babe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms along that line, although I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">played a little small poker. Inasmuch as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're going to be playing with ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars of mine, I'm naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in the modus operandi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duke noted that Latin phrase. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry Ivers was evidently a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts. He was becoming more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in the past of this merchant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frontier who betrayed education and</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience aside from that gained in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">places as the Yukon and the Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">border.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell looked over at Daly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers' eyes also seemed to gravitate in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the slim blond young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the youthful face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we'd better forget crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">stud dealing," Daly said evenly, "except</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an occasional thing. It would spoil</seg><seg type="columnLine">our draw game to sit side by side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps I can get away with an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">stud hand unassisted. Now on draw we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better have at least three sets of signals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">change them every ten hands, and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps we can get away with our share of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boodle. If there's an innocent outsider</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the game, we'll return his money</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He described the signals in detail, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fifteen minutes various matters which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might arise were taken up. Henry Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there, immobile and expressionless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his eyes were very bright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said finally, getting up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair, "let's get you boys a quick bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat and then let you go to it. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're eating I'll fix up a twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar credit--no, I believe I'll make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty thousand. That game's liable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg><seg type="columnLine">be very big. What a dumb-bell I am--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thought of this dodge--and Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking about Lee's poker playing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">four years!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HALF hour later Ivers got them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hot dog stand where they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ eaten, and was escorting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the door of Donnelly's. Facing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and only ten feet from it, was a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar with four bartenders at work. At one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of it there was a door, and over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low partition dividing the shallow bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room from the rear there came the never</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending, unmistakable sound of many men</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambling. Waiters were very busy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">purveying to the back room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers led them through the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly's eyes took in the scene quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were at least twenty-five tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered over the huge structure, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge of a house man with an eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade over his eyes. Klondike, twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, roulette, stud and draw poker, faro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keno--all were there. In the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room two huge green crap tables were</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by a throng of men. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the room a barred cashier's cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">held three men--one cashier and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, both armed' with sawed off shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns as well as revolvers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll play upstairs," Ivers told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "Here's Donnelly now. See that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man standing by the crap tables--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tallest one? That's Derringer. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll play with you, if he has time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Donnelly, this is Mr. MacDowell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Daly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duke Daly had seen a thousand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly's type. He was of medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, slightly bald, carefully dressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his smooth, fleshy face held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speciously genial smile while cool black</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes mirrored no emotion whatever. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip was neither strong nor weak. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a carefully groomed denizen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a city underworld. His mouth was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipped, and bracketed in two very deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've heard of your father," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell. "Glad to know you. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers here has said that he stands be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind you for any amount, and I guess you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a real game, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His smile seemed to convey admiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two real gamblers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's us," Tex said with a grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've got some money, and crave</seg><seg type="columnLine">action."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have a private room upstairs,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly told them. "Over there is Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer. He's willing to play--one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wealthiest men in town--and a rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">little lease hound named Dave Harris, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">likes a good game. I'm going to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, to fill out the game and because</seg><seg type="columnLine">I crave action, personally."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again that wide, oily smile, which did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not change those hard eyes. Daly felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fundamental coldness and calculation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he went on with apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankness, "our usual house cut of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent, deducted from all stacks bought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be in order. That's mild for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">racket, don't you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly nodded, Donnelly seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking mostly to him, despite the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had said nothing. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested persistently on the Duke, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to figure him out. It was almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he sensed a familiar something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him which puzzled him. Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought back to the old days, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain, however, that he had never run</seg><seg type="columnLine">across Mr. Draw One Donnelly. Possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly had seen him, however, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of him. The change in the flyer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face,: due to the operation, frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled people who had known him</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go up," suggested Donnelly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll get Slats and Dave right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm leaving you," Ivers said. "I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my office when you get through. Sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer is going to play, eh? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">good luck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled a very wide and beaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, and waddled out of the noisy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke filled room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We play against three," Daly said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">low tones as Donnelly went after Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer. "They'll be doing a whole lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising just on their weight of money</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">against us. It looks like never quitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on good hands for us, always providing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers was right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex nodded. Both had their eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer, who was walking toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He was taller even than Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell, who was six feet two, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lank body was slim and bony looking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was long and thin,'the brow high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and craglike over deep set, fierce looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. His bold nose curved over a thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost lipless mouth, and his cheeks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hollow that his face was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">leathery skin stretched tightly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruding bones. His iron gray hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew to a point over his forehead, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood straight up in a high pompadour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a topknot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His piercing blue eyes darted quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances at the two flyers, and he shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with crisp strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad to know you," he said tersely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice deep and harsh. "I may not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to play long, but others will happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. I hate to break up a game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dave'll be right up," Donnelly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed them, and led the way up narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE SECOND floor room was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted exclusively to card games,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all played with silent intentness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These, evidently, were big players. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of various types, but leaned mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to older men whose clothing subtly indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated their higher positions in the Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ona scheme of things. Daly thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them were owners, or technical</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. He did not see one man who looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a roughneck or small salaried tool</seg><seg type="columnLine">pusher or driller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room which they were to use was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a room, really--it was rather one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of alcoves, separated from each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other by rude partitions. The side toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main room was wide open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harris arrived as they were sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. He was a small, consumptive</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking Jew, with oily black hair and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous hooked nose. He was dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in blue serge, and his eyes were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">always on the ground. He was self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed, and his movements were quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a cat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He's got every mark there is of an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced croupier," Daly thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On a side\table Donnelly set a rack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's you gentlemen's idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original take-out?" he inquired. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleshy face became more round as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. "Let's make it a real game, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two thousand stacks?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O.K.," Daly found himself saying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I should say a two thousand dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit, at the outside--or table stakes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Table stakes," rasped Derringer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chips were counted out as they sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Tex and Daly took chairs in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions they had arranged between</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. Donnelly was on Daly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and Harris on his left. To Harris's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left was Derringer, and Tex was between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oil man and Donnelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One thing we might settle," Daly said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "Ivers guarantees our payment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. What I mean is, do we get paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in cash?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely, you fellow!" Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him with that pretended blithe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Derringer permitted himself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wintry grin. Harris was expressionless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands playing with his chips, stacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and restacking them with lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">like speed. "What do you think we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">those guards for? There's more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred thousand dollars cash in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">house tonight, and it'll be a lot more be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the first deal started five men took</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats at a table in front of the alcove, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">house man with them who dealt nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but stud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Daly settled down to the ferocious con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centration which was one of the reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he was a poker player who seldom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if ever, lost against the average compe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tition. The others were silent, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched every hand like a hawk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered how much to lose, if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game was crooked, before finally deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was. It so happened that he broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in the first seven hands--and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">.they told the tale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the second hand he went in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">three tens, drawing two cards. Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly had opened for fifty dollars, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew one card. Derringer had stayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also drew one. Donnelly bet a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars, and Daly raised a hundred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer re-raised two hundred, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly promptly re-raised a full five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars--practically his stack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might as well find out now as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, cheap," Daly thought, and called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Derringer threw his hand into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck Daly, as though by accident, thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand forward and the cards fell face</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. A four card flush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sixes and fours," Donnelly said sourly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Daly showed his threes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heavy raising and re-raising on noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, believing I'd surely lay down my</seg><seg type="columnLine">threes against two raising one card</seg><seg type="columnLine">draws!" thought Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex looked at him questioningly. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps because he was ultrasensitive, Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not give the signal to start their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme of play. On the seventh hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, assurance was made doubly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time it was Tex, who stuck stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornly on kings and eights against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising and re-raising of three three-card</seg><seg type="columnLine">draws, until his stack disappeared as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a final seven hundred dollar raise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Derringer's part. The other two, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been apparently so strong, dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Derringer had just a pair of jacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't bluff a thing in this game!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," thought Duke. "Not with us</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing your racket. But when you boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">start getting some good hands, or if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know what you were up to, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd clean us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced at Tex, and nodded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked battle was on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the first half dozen hands after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was little action. Neither he</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor Tex had anything to speak of, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">way or another. On the seventh hand it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Duke's deal. Tex signaled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small pair. Daly himself had a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">kings. No one opened, so Daly did, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harris and Derringer both stayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which surprised Daly somewhat. Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what he had to do. It was a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, by sheer weight of money between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, they could probably win on</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raise it fifty," drawled Tex, "just on</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospects."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly's eyes narrowed when Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed. He and Tex were playing against</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men. He had caught none of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals yet. Probably they were planning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do again the same thing he and Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">were--win by weight of combined money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Knowing I'm best to go in," Daly said</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, "I re-raise two hundred dollars!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harris and Derringer had passed open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the pot, but stayed for the raises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell, his big body radiating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter absorption in the situation and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy in it, surveyed his cards carefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This hand of mine is going to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth everything or nothing," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced with a grin. "I tilt her five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Same here, big boy," said Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that specious smile, and put in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Literally thousands of hours of poker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">often played under conditions where his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life itself was at stake if he slipped, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the Duke an uncanny intuition</seg><seg type="columnLine">where cards were concerned. His mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously cool and clear as it always</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in emergencies, was working with</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, detached speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harris might pass under the gun," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected. "You can't figure Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pass a second hand if he had any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing good. Donnelly was next to last--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't pass anything above a pair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly. They're ganging up on us</seg><seg type="columnLine">again as sure as hell, on nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at his cards calmly. Harris'</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were on the table. Derringer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing a wolfish joy in the game, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">piercing eyes concentrating on Daly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Donnelly was sitting back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fellows are playing a lot of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled straights and four card flushes," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">said casually, "and I'll be damned if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw against my little openers for nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here goes my stack, if you want to draw!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was more than $3500 in the pot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he thought the raise the correct</seg><seg type="columnLine">strategy. There could be no more betting</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the draw--all stacks would be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted, and it was table stakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harris threw in his cards, as did Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer and Tex. Daly tensed as Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no use of disguising his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly had passed, next to last man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and betting was over- Daly took three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three myself. And I still have what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went in with--a pair of aces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly silently laid down a pair of kings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You win, and a good hand at that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He avoided meeting MacDowell's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly had stood all that raising and</seg><seg type="columnLine">re-raising, for big money, on a pair of aces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too uncanny to believe, almost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or else Donnelly was the poorest poker</seg><seg type="columnLine">player alive. He couldn't have played</seg><seg type="columnLine">more perfectly if he had known what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly's hand was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And of course the cards aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked!" Daly thought fiercely as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said calmly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I'll take a five thousand dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In three more hands signals would</seg><seg type="columnLine">change. Did those men, by any possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility, know the signals between Tex and</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself? They were using fingers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal their hand--pair, two pairs, threes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight, and so on, and voice inflections</seg><seg type="columnLine">to indicate the value of the combinations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next three hands produced nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensational. The table was a pool of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence amid the drone of the room. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">five men at the next table, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, were a bit more noisy than any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly smelled a rat somewhere. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly play was unbelievable. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signals changed, to eyes and a method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of folding up cards after looking at them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt more confidence. Twice during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next few hands the three Verona</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamblers bet fairly high against mediocre</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on the part of the airmen, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals could be detected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there came a hand, with Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell dealing, on which Tex signaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">three queens before the draw. Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. Daly raised, on nothing, to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a pot for Tex. Harris re-raised five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars. MacDowell hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally just stayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up one thousand!" Donnelly an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced, his eyes darting around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly dropped, as did Harris, and Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell stayed. Donnelly drew two cards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tex the same number. MacDowell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes rose from his cards, and gazed long</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ceiling while he meditatively blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smoke ring--two of them. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a small pair for a queen full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Check," Donnelly snapped, and Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell bet a thousand dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," Donnelly said viciously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw his cards into the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Openers?" Daly said earnestly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly had thrown down three aces</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a two card draw, on a not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual sized bet for that game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That poker is too smart for me," Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought slowly, and he could fairly feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell's eyes burning into him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"These birds know our signals!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did the thing agreed upon between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex and himself in case they should want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change them in an emergency. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed a cigaret from the Southerner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Four hands after their change in signals</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three Verona men tangled with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when the storm had blown over Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Daly had lost four thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them, forcing two pairs--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had lost to aces up in Harris' hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once again the poker was too uncanny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was a ringtailed snorter," Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked without emotion. "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stretch my legs and get a drink before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next hand. Deal me out if you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I'll imbibe one myself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawled Tex. "Anybody else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Slats, I want to see you a minute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a short, stalwart man in puttees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeches and an oilstained hat. Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">went aside with him while the two flyers</seg><seg type="columnLine">went downstairs to the bar. Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell was furious.	I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They know our signals," Daly said</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">! "Of course they do! That means that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry Ivers told 'em. He got us into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this--why, the son of a gun worked it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we suggested it ourselves! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">means--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"May mean several things," Daly cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">in incisively. "We can't stay away too</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. We're ten thousand out between us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There must be a way to get these</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds!" Tex interrupted savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can try this, and quit when we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if we feel like it. There might be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big pot, if we're in luck, before they get</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. Listen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took but a few seconds to explain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were back at the table within two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, and Daly announced easily:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, we've had a council of war and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we decided we couldn't make money</seg><seg type="columnLine">without money. How about eight thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand more apiece, Mr. Donnelly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There speaks a man after my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart!" Donnelly chuekled, his fat face</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaming with artificial geniality. "Fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen thousand each, and everything is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotsy totsy. How about the rest of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting our stacks even, eh? I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than that myself. Dave, you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not up to that and neither are you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slats."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All agreed while the Duke thought--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All set for bigger killings."</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE the chips were being count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, another man entered and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer aside for a talk. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment Derringer seemed to hesitate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll play a few more hands, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be there," he said harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly studied him curiously. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawklike face was as rugged as a bleak</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. Tall and thin and bony, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sort of natural ferocity, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron control, obvious in him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing with .wolfish enjoyment in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the next three hands it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more obvious that the three were playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, if more evidence was needed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they were in a pot together, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">either flyer in it, they played without</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest and called the first small bet on</seg><seg type="columnLine">good hands. They had no interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">winning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the fifth hand after the interruption</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly opened his cards warily. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not change in the slightest as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at an ace full. The time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He signaled Tex a pair of queens, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first system of signals. The new set,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which their three opponents could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly know, indicated his real hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex signaled nothing, by both systems.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Verona men figured that one pair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all they had between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Harris' deal, and Derringer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">luckily, opened. Tex raised him one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll figure we're off on a raise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">re-raise thing or nothing, and will be out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get us," Daly assured himself. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was pounding. His eyes, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that film dropped across them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face never changed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly just stayed, and Daly raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred. Harris and Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're set to take our bluff!" Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, and as he darted a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell that towering gentleman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a picture of utter bliss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He re-raised, and it went on, Daly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell doing all the reraising, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">each man had put four thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pot. It was time to strike, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Harris who did it after a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've just been sitting around saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing on the best hand," he mumbled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now she really goes up for them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to draw. Here goes my stack!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't quite his stack, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to exhaust the four thousand odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars which the flyers had in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good poker," Daly thought to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "That would stop us, if we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Derringer stayed, MacDowell dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">regretfully, and Donnelly stayed, assur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the table that he was sorry he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's mine," Daly said quietly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see their faces mirror utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand won after the draw without</seg><seg type="columnLine">competition. The highest hand between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three which was shown was Harris'</seg><seg type="columnLine">openers--kings and threes--and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had staked twenty-four thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell lighted a cigaret and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummed a little tune. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pools of light. The pot had put the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men more than ten thousand to the good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">net.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly was tense, watching the taut</seg><seg type="columnLine">players like a hawk. They were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely baffled. They must realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their game was gone, probably, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">they just had better luck. They no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the signals of their opponents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would be the next move?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the next two hands there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">none. The table was silent as the grave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each man playing as though life itself was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at stake. The stud players at the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">table were growing noisier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly, all traces of joviality gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, shuffled the cards. He shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to Tex to cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hell I did!" shouted a man at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Donnelly picked up the cut cards a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, roughly dressed player rose to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll cut your heart out!" he shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and table and chips crashed to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a second there was a wild melee</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the rest of the room watched. For just</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant Daly's eyes, like every one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">else, was on the battle. Immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, his mind was back on the game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not look around, but unless he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly mistaken there was at least an even</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that Draw One Donnelly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched decks in the excitement. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he had seen something from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got a cold deck to use in emergen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cies!" Daly thought swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle was over in a moment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men left amid the hoots of the onlookers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was staged," Daly reflected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was on his feet, helping pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips. He caught MacDowell's eye, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Texan came over to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think they switched decks," Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">said swiftly. "Play it. Maybe we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure something, and if we can't I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly searched if we have to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a moment of general excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room was quiet again and they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a bunch o' drunks," Donnelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Well, here we go, boys. You cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, MacDowell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Complete quiet settled over the alcove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a world of its own. Daly had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at a poker hand with such burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest as he did at these five subtly fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling cards which he opened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was looking at three kings, a six</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a seven. He was thinking:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it's a cold hand, they won't dare be</seg><seg type="columnLine">too crude. The hands'll be completed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the draw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at Tex. The Southener was</seg><seg type="columnLine">signaling a ten full. He had a pat hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly Daly's mind was made up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But which man was to beat them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he have his hand pat?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pass," he said briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no surprise on the part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one. He was first under the gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris passed, as did Derringer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wouldn't be Donnelly who'd beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">us; it would be one of the others. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealing," Daly thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex opened for a hundred dollars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donnelly studied his cards regretfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He passed. One man out. Daly raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">it five hundred dollars. Harris stayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Derringer dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thin little Jew, eyes on the f table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hands playing ceaselessly with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards, smoked his cigaret in nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffs. Never had Daly felt such mounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement in a card game. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">players were stooped over the table, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer, especially, seemed as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were drawn to the game by terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic attraction which would not let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him leave although he should want to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clatter of the crowded room, the noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below, the drone of the swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets--all were forgotten by the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyer as he mapped out his plan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex MacDowell was right on the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Derringer's leaving, it's getting late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so let's make this pot a good one," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawled, his voice vibrant. "Up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And two," Daly said unemotionally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harris' opaque black eyes darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Donnelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't backin' down," he said huskily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And five, if that's the way you feel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell studied his cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't mind admitting I've got all I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever going to get," he said nonchalantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll just stay, I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not me. The size of your stack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris," said the Duke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harris threw away his cigaret and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted another in two lightning like</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O.K."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly looked over at MacDowell. Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Texan plumb his plan? Of course he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would stay. He must--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Duke pushed his chair back</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly. His eyes were on Donnelly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were two possibilities in Harris'</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. One that he had an unbeatable</seg><seg type="columnLine">pat hand, and had passed in the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that Tex would open. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed scarcely believable. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no object in disguising his hand, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be suspicious for the second player</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass up a pat hand for a raise. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more likely, in every way, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a hand he would have to fill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was just taking a ride," Daly said</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, his eyes on Donnelly's pasty face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a quick movement he thrust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand into the deck. He had not been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opener.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give me five cards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly's mouth sagged open and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face seemed to go a greenish white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a grunt from Derringer, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though somebody had hurt him cruelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was trying to disguise his pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris' eyes raised, and they glittered</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a snake's. A sigh escaped him. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as though the table was surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by images, each eye concentrated on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond young man from whose sculptured</seg><seg type="columnLine">face there looked forth those eyes of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience and cold competence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Deal 'em, Donnelly," he said in low</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones, and his right hand was at his side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Army holster swung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Donnelly, for the moment, was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced gambler. His hand shook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without removing his eyes from Daly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slowly dealt five cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One," whispered Harris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scarcely bothered to look at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand pat," stated TeXr "On a ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">full."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly looked at his cards. The blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running hot through his veins. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next move he knew not, but across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table was the man who, from all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, he would have picked to be by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side in an emergency like this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first two cards were the fourth king</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nine of hearts. Then there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace of hearts. He knew he had won.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he drawn but one card to his threes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have filled, and the nine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts would have filled the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris' open end straight flush. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew two, Harris would have got the ace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hearts, which would also have filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take all the money," Harris said, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though baffled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The table was looking at Daly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he were some freak of nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their knowledge of the plot showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly--they did not notice Tex. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gentleman scooped in the money--</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen thousand dollars of it from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies--Daly's eyes roved to Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer's. There was what amounted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilly admiration there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not in Donnelly's. It seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was murder in those murky depths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Daly wasted no time. He pushed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair a little more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Donnelly, and the rest of you--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know we're wise," he said very slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolly. "No monkey business from now</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. This game is over here and now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've been outcrooked. I saw you</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch decks. Now listen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaned forward, and his hand, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtrusively, was on the butt of his gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silence was like a wet fog over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cash in our chips now, and in cash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't dare monkey with us. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a lot of people on the outside--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of Verona--who know what we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to do. If you make one false move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your gambling dump is going on the fritz</seg><seg type="columnLine">right tonight. I'll tell everybody in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place about it, and have it out of business</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow. If there's anything more</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly than just cheating, you and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and your friends are going to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown to hell tomorrow. Get that? Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">you call somebody and you get us our</seg><seg type="columnLine">money pronto or you'll be searched for</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof within one minute publicly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse than that will happen in twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not getting tough. I'm telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, before you tell me something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm leaving. I have no idea what this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is all about." It was Derringer's harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "I'll settle tomorrow," he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruffly, and walked out of the alcove as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though leaving something very unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long moment Donnelly sat there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Duke felt that he could watch his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, like a rat in a trap, doubling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">redoubling, trying to find a way out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, so suddenly that it was a shock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fleshy gambler relaxed, and that false</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile spread over his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won, and won right, and you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">your money," he said with his grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">widening. There was no trace of shame</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly scarcely knew why, but he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that Donnelly felt that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MOMENT later he and Tex were</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning against the alcove, close</seg><seg type="columnLine">-	together. They had allowed Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly to go down after the money, finally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Duke was certain that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthcoming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Duke, my hand," Tex whispered as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they supposedly watched the room. "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">we rook 'em? And how! Say, Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't left yet. What are we going to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dough?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inasmuch as it's a dead cinch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry Ivers is as crooked as a cork-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screw," Daly said evenly, his eyes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall oil man who was conversing earnestly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't believe it," Tex said slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Somebody may have been listening in in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that warehouse when we were talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'd have been in the room behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office then, and how'd he get there with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Ivers knowing about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDowell's tanned face was suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in grim lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy, how he worked it!" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Didn't suggest it himself--but we fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his trap! Doublecrossing dad, eh, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting us down here to lose twenty thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand or so besides all that he and Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer are rooking the old man out of in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ways," he ruminated, slow venom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his voice. "If it's true, and it sure looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, what a frame up it is! Maybe, to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old boy credit, this Slats Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">has something on him and forced him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cooperate: Hank and Dad buy acreage</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a gamble, and then Ivers plays Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer's hand and lets or helps Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie it up now that it's valuable. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">take no chance if it wasn't--and take no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of losing the acreage now that it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable. Why, that old skinflint is</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably embezzling from the business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too--shooting machinery to Derringer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giv ing him all the breaks, fooling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">books--everything! And to cap it off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gets us down here to lose thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the old man's good dough--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It strikes me that we'd better fly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">money out of this town pronto!" Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">said quietly. Now, the excitement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle he had loved gone, he was as aloof</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though discussing the spending of ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. "I wonder about Ivers' guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here comes Donnelly--with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinero," Tex whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gambler had in his hands a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come back here," he told them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took them into a small room. The watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful flyers had counted out for them win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings of more than twenty-five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better buy the bag," grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell. "How much, Donnelly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it with my compliments," Don-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nelly smiled back. It was a mere widen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So long, many thanks--and don't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">us fooled with," Tex warned him. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a visit to make, and it isn't far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Until we get there, our hands won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray far from these Colts--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good' God, Duke! Donnelly! Want</seg><seg type="columnLine">'to get out? What the hell is coming off?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly leaped to the door beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed MacDowell. A stream of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were erupting from the stairway, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their head was Jed Conklin. The faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of the leathery, irascible little Texan</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alight with an almost fanatical</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow. Behind him heavily armed men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were disposing themselves around the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't nobody be scared--you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--but don't make no wrong moves</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dozens of gamblers sat as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">petrified. There was no fear in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces--rather a dazed interest in the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedings. Donnelly brushed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers and stood in front of the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over across the room Slats Derringer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless as a statue. Daly, his level</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sweeping the room, felt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern jawed oil operator loomed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant even in tljat crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conklin was like a small gamecock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his sombrero on the back of his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his small body fairly quivering with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, all o' you!" he proclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm here to get Slats Derringer out o' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way for tomorrow, and then return 'im.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm electioneerin', if you want t' put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way, and I'm speakin' my piece all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around town and doin' other things in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bargain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught sight of Donnelly, and bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mockingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evenin', Draw One," he said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate sarcasm. "You're due for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little vacation from these parts. Slats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you make a move or I'll have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hogtied in three seconds less'n nothin'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got about three hundred o' yore plug</seg><seg type="columnLine">uglies where they won't do no harm fur a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day or so, and don't forgit that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get out of his sight," Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered, "and hear what's going on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was like a dream, those armed men</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the walls. Evidently Conklin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the downstairs part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house without a struggle. The stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were packed with curious gamblers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower floor, and from without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise of the mob was growing louder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now git this, everybody," Conklin</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, pacing up and down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the room. "None of you care</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about who runs this here town, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">way or the other. You all know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slats Derringer's been runnin' it, havin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">more men, more acreage, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinero that he's stole than anybody else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's even hired the only airplane so no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else can use it in a pinch.

Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly there was a great deal of shouting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a moment the noises of a mighty battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">came washing against the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Conklin seemed thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck. Suddenly Derringer was on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see how much you can get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with!" he shouted. "I'll cram every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' your insults down your throat, Jed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conklin. Got my men, have you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's them, outside!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, boys!" Conklin yelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Out o' the way on them stairs!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN AN instant the Conklin forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had accompanied him were</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging down the steps. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakable evidence from without that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the struggle was a gargantuan one. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that the whole main street must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be engaged. Shouts, curses, occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots, breaking glass and all the din of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough and tumble battle were plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell's eyes were alight with glee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Conklin and Derringer are going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight it out right now!" he breathed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Say, Duke, Ivers must have tipped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. What do we do now?" the Duke</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked absently. "Tex, there isn't a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do. Our job is to save this</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinero right now--and talk to Ivers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What our job is a little later I don't know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What may be going on with this town as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a center may interest the Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much. Let's see this window. It'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be as much as our life is worth to go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tiny window was about fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet off the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go down on our belts, and you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop and I'll catch you," Tex suggested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a minute, their two belts tied to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether and dangling from the sill, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down. He dropped to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly released the belts, and then dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Texan's arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen to that!" Daly said, with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost awe in his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The street battle was an epic. Guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not in use, now, but the thorough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare was a solid mass of heaving bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody had joined in, it seemed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a battle royal, and" Verona was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">madhouse. Some dives were being looted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, as a sideline to the fight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Derringer either didn't take Ivers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg><seg type="columnLine">warnings seriously, or else Conklin struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">too unexpectedly," Daly surmised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Slats wanted to leave the game, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't, it seemed to me. He must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he had everything arranged. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess Conklin's got some of his leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">henchmen out of the way, but Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">has enough organized opposition left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it interesting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they stole around the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers storehouse, they got a good view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main street. It was almost an</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized battle now. One solid mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men was being driven back, but Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell whether they composed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces of Conklin or Derringer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting was terrific, and stunned men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being trampled in the surge and flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thgy got in the back door, and two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three watchmen were satisfied to let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">make their way through the merchandise</seg><seg type="columnLine">after they had explained their errand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The front of the store was deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder whether Ivers is out watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--no, he wouldn't be," Texas said as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they mounted the stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IIE UPPER f|oor was practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. Somewhere in the rear one</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His office is lighted," Daly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked. "I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Throw up your hands!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From behind four different masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">material there came four men. All had</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns and all were masked. They ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced toward the flyers, the leader's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sparkling through the slits in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask. Where had Daly seen those eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, what's this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ivers was at the door of his office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stay where you are!" barked some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and a man detached himself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his comrades and covered the storekeeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Every one of these fellows is a Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can!" Daly told himself unbelievingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And Ivers, damn him, is in on it! Try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to pretend these men could be hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside his office door without him</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What saps we are!" Tex was groaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the men got to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly was flaying himself, also. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have buried the money back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambling place. No, the hiding place</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been tortured out of them, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I presume this is what you want," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said coolly, thrusting the bag forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader bowed mockingly. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall and slender. Why was he so familiar?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right," he agreed. "We also</seg><seg type="columnLine">want Lieutenant MacDowell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an exclamation of utter aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment from the Texan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the hell do you mean?" Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly shrieked in his wheezy voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall take Lieutenant MacDowell</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the river, and it will cost his father</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty thousand dollars to get him back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader spoke those words as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying them. Behind the mask his</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar eyes were aglow with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">catlike light. Suddenly Daly's mind, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice now, found the solution of the famil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iarity. He was the man from whom they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked directions, that afternoon--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blond hair and the oriental eyes. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no one else. And he had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers, from what he had said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The directions shall be given now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We will go into the office, to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stilted English, spoken with just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trace of an accent, was the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">identification of the mocking outlaw, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as the Duke was concerned. Helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">before six ready guns, Ivers and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers were marched into the office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Right outside the window were hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people, Daly reflected. On the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor were watchmen. That battle out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side was interspersed with shots now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Daly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader was businesslike now. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked cohorts disposed themselves in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. At least three of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow, or at latest the next day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will fly, with the money, down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river between Laredo and McMullen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will find, on the Mexican side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, a field with a white cross in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. You will land there. If there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ships in the air, all will be lost. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">3'ou have guns on your ship, all will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost. You will land. If all is correct, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man will meet you, and you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed where to fly to give over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money and to return Lieutenant Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell to his father. If nothing happens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely you would not expect us to let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">go free?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited a moment for reply. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying himself to the hilt, the outwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed but inwardly boiling Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see. Tex was a streak of flame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was half crouched, ready to spring on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those guns at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," the leader went on with relish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we shall proceed. Bind Mr. Ivers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Daly, Caballeros. I know that Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers and Mr. MacDowell, senior, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners. There will be no excuse for lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a second Daly considered showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. The next instant he discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea. Doubtless he and Tex would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be deader than doornails the second he</seg><seg type="columnLine">denounced Ivers. As he stood quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing his hands* to be bound behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back and his ankles to be strapped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought things through. If Ivers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a secret ally of Derringer, he was doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly in league with these bandits. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidnaping of Tex--he would be justified,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the world's point of view, in put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting up the money without even consult-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the elder MacDowell. The very next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, as a matter of fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our little trip down here was figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put about sixty thousand dollars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex's father's money into the pockets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivors and Derringer!" Daly reflected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the fat, flabby, basilisk eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers became a monster to him. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he felt so utterly repelled by a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality as he was by the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly become like an unclean animal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Double crossing his dearest friend, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitatingly committing him to mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">anguish and enriching himself, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghoul . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Buenas noch.es!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bandit leader was standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, looking down at the two bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gagged men. Daly was lying three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four feet from Ivers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be all right, Duke," Tex said, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice choked with fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outlaw put out the light, and Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the door lock click.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT a second's delay Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed across the floor toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers. With his back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchant, he felt with his fettered hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the hands of his enemy. The bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Ivers were very loose. Tex was in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">special danger, he reflected. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something always to be figured was part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the temperament of the Texan. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would seize the slightest excuse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a break. The getaway to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Border must be all arranged for, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. And men who would dare, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter what protection, to kidnap an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Army officer would certainly take no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances. Nor would they hesitate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot, and shoot to kill, if necessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above all, the situation at Verona de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded cleaning up. From Ivers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer and Donnelly and those men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on whom there was no absolutely ironclad</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence which would hold in court, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could expect no confession. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandit gang, however, there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who would talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers' hands were free. His bonds had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a joke. He untied his ankles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Duke heard him get to his feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment the light was on again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat storekeeper was untying Daly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a hell of a note," he was saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his full moon face woebegone. "Bill'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never forgive me for this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Daly got to his feet he was wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the dozenth time whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamblers had gotten word to Ivers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flyers had known that their signals</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been given away. He decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chances of that were slim. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be sure, anyhow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing could be gained, and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing lost, possibly, by giving away his</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand right then. Ivers might realize,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the result of the game, that his share</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the plot was known. For a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly hesitated. Outside the noise had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died away somewhat. The battle seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have shifted down the street. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shots from a distance now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly lifted the telephone. First he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the Laredo flight in action. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandits were riding, doubtless, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fifteen miles to go. They could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off at the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No use of that," Ivers wheezed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Somebody--Jed Conklin, I guess--cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines between here and Laredo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silent Daly speedily verified that</seg><seg type="columnLine">information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So long," he said evenly. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Wait a minute!" Ivers said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. "What are you going to--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get after Tex, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly was standing at the door, seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly utterly composed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't do that! They'd kill Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps. What can you do to interfere?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can fly after 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Daly's shadowed eyes were on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy jowled face, and perhaps some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in them gave his thoughts away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If final proof were needed of Ivers' par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipation in the scheme, he had it then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't let you do it, for the sake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex and Bill," Ivers told him, and a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">note had crept into his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand, apparently casually, strayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a desk drawer. In a split second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly's mind was made up. Time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious, but Ivers had an excuse to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">him there. He could pretend it was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best interests of MacDowell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly's gun was out in a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hell you will," he said icily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ivers, I'm going and going now. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie you up so you can't interfere, on any</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretext whatever. Don't move."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inwardly he was thinking:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If my ship was already out of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission he'd let me go out there. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards of his weren't instructed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey with it unless it was necessary."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a few seconds Ivers sat there, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge Buddha. He seemed eyeless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a sudden effect of utter coldness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him. It was as though the flesh were</seg><seg type="columnLine">petrified, but the spirit within radiating</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before you make a move, Daly," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said slowly, his lips barely moving, "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling you you'd better not. You've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drop on me, but you'd better not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's thoroughly scared at the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me getting into the air," Daly thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with controlled exultation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" he asked aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go to any lengths, for MacDowelPs</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, to keep you from interfering. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the extent of telling you that if you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">this crazy thing there'll be a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man arrested immediately for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder of one Jim Fitzpatrick, within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few miles of this place, several years ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something seemed to snap inside Daly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that what he had been dreading,</seg><seg type="columnLine">subconsciously, all along had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could see the headlines now:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Government Agent Accused of Murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Border Barroom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AS HE stood there in the barren office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">/A with the noise of Verona washing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through the windows, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a few seconds in which he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure he had built for himself crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him. The past would be spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the country to read. Professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler, murderer--now a Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent. Disgraced,. he would drop out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the niche he had worked so hard to carve</seg><seg type="columnLine">for himself. That the murder had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-defense would make no difference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had nothing to fear from the law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except exposure. He faced the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be an outcast, a branded crook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the hateful, terrible days when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been forced to live a life he loathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with people whom he despised, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back. The height to which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted himself by his bootstraps through</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten years of effort would be lost in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he raised his eyes to those lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in Ivers' face there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them which made Ivers say hastily:</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I'm not the only one that knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, either. It won't do you any good to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put me out of the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As so frequently happened when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced a crisis, Daly's mind seemed ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">normally keen. Despite the fact that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was lead within him, his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to work automatically. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of frozen clarity he had decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes of time, one way or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, meant little. He could catch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandits in Mexico, if necessary, and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">international law have its way with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">after MacDowell was safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Ivers," he said coolly, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking into tragic depths rather than at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man before him, "you can do as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">please about raking up the past. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know as much as you do, you know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Fitzpatrick was a white eyed rat of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer, who got by because his father at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time was the smuggling king of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Border who pulled wires that even led to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington at times. And you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the drunken louse shot a poor old</seg><seg type="columnLine">coon who didn't get him a sandwich fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and that I shot him when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on me because I told him what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. Go ahead and talk, damn you, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll have plenty of chance to! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may let the country know what I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was a kid, but, by God, they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you were a doublecrossing crook</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers did not even blink his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tension was like a physical thickness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">huskily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That you're in with Derringer, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're doublecrossing Mr. MacDowell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you tipped off our signals in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">game tonight and got us here to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, and that this abduction of Tex is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frameup to get you and your pals</seg><seg type="columnLine">another fifty thousand! God, what a rat</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are! I don't know what you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the MacDowells, but you'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to tell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're crazy, Daly. And it won't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you anything. Assuming for the sake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument that you were right, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof would you have? And wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you be crazy to--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers eyed the ready gun and played</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his watch chain. He looked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make sure that they were alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe," he said slowly, "we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a deal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly knew in an instant that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade silence for silence. His own past</seg><seg type="columnLine">would remain a secret, if he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent on the subject of Henry Ivers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with the force of a stunning physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal blow, the implication in Ivers' words</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his eyes widen and his body feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">numb. Ivers must realize that Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew as much as Daly himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers did not expect that Tex would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to tell any tales whatever!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The paralyzed flyer fought for control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that he thought of it, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable. Already the gang had proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves totally without scruples of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any kind. The kidnaping of an Army</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer was a serious business which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">result, for the definitely known bandits, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unending hunt. It would be a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of international law. They had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked. Tex would know what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like. What amount of money</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cause them to take a chance on such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crime, if they were not almost guaran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teed safety after it was over? What more</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely than that they collect the money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kilL MacDowell anyway? Tex had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a Border Patrolman for five years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dozens of outlaws feared, dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hated him. He alone, almost single</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed, had put Dave Fitzpatrick be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the bars, and Dave had had a legion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of followers. Ivers himself must hate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elder MacDowell. Vengeance and money</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined--why, those very bandits in</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose charge he was might be made up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with a grudge against the officer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an instant Daly made up his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything in the world was forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">now except that the life of his friend was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in danger. From that second on no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of his own personal safety entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his calculations in the slightest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just what do you mean?"" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just that you do nothing, nothing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, and say nothing, now or later. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree to do likewise. We're alone. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can talk freely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose I should tell you that Tex</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows as much as I do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers' face did not change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "MacDowell will not bother us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">_ It was said as coolly as if he were speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a business deal. Daly lounged</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't afford to have my life ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this business," he said calmly. "Pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">slick layout, worth a couple of hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars to you and Derringer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh? Say, you must hate old man Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ivers' eyes were on his desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifteen years ago," he almost whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered, "I swore I'd get him some day."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What was the matter, and why doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he know it? I should think--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed that Ivers took warning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eye lids raised suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of your business. And re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member this: You can be shot and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as the identified murderer who</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to escape. Every excuse will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours. You're having a favor done you</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we offer to let you go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly moved like a striking rattlesnake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His gun came down on the head of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound of unclean flesh, and Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped, unconscious. The Duke had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned all he could. And he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that neither he nor Tex would live</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell the tale if Ivers had his way. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swapped his own knowledge to get at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ivers' plans, and it behooved him to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Verona without delay. His plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">were complete.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN A TRICE he had bound the uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious man securely. He must take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance on getting a start of a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. He was not thinking of his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal safety. He was thinking of Mac^</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could climb the partition between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office and the storeroom outside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandit had already locked the door, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture to protect Ivers. Possibly no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would enter during the night. Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men were busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned out the light, after taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun out of the desk drawer, and scaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the partition with the aid of a chair. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked out boldly, using the back way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found a horse tethered to the rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building. That was lucky, saved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from borrowing or stealing one on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main street. A horse would make better</seg><seg type="columnLine">time than a car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Circling the town only lost him a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. He did not even see the main street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he got the impression that a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob of milling men were in excited con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clave along its entire length. Riding like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, he sped through the mesquite</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the field. He covered the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in a few minutes, and by that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plan of action was settled in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode toward the field behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier of the canvas hangar and left his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse there. Undoubtedly those guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been carefully instructed. Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have figured on the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship's being used should Daly by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance get free. They would have orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep him out of the air by some method</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran through the mesquite toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hangar. The noise of drills, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a quarter of a mile of the field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned out any sound he might make.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got to the back of the canvas hangar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to have one light in it. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crept around to the corner, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">De Haviland came into view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four men were sitting around it, plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible in the moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A couple of 'em must be flyers," Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were not more than fifty feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of the hangar, if that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God I brought the other gun,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought as he got it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both guns cocked and ready, he broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put up your hands!" he shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't make another move!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surprise was complete. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the amazed faces of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, and of the men who must be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their clothing, the flyers. One, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surprise, was a young Mexican with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pock marked face. The other was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most furtive eyed man he had ever seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Middle aged and very small, he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be totally unable to look at Daly in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other manner than quick, frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances. Probably he was the mechanic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Daly was about to speak he sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly stiffened. From afar his ears caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of thudding hoofbeats. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses. Some one was riding, and riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, toward the field. Had Ivers been</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered by his friends?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may be on the level, all of you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said tersely, "but I take no chances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drop your guns, you guards, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four of you run like hell for the other end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this field! Fast!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a second they hesitated. He shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly to one side of the mechanic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I meant it," he said coolly. "And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers--don't get into the air or I'll shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">you down without asking any ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexican pilot dropped a blistering</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse and started to run. He was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed. The others, their eyes darting</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the horsemen who were now in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, five hundred yards away, did like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship was all right, Daly thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he vaulted into the rear cockpit. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liberty/luckily, had a self-starter and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over the partitions between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpits to start it. On the second try it</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught. There were shots from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsemen--his last doubt as to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission was swept away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT fastening his belt he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the cold Liberty the gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wiggled the controls very</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly as the big bomber rushed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field. Elevators and ailerons moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">obediently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Close to the black wall of mesquite on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other end of the field he pulled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stick, and the DH answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took the smooth night air cleanly, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite the sputtering motor. He circled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field as he unwound the radio antenna.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That radio key wgis his reason for being</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the back seat. The roar of the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew smoother &gt;as the Liberty warmed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been a desperate chance, taking off</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it stone cold, but he had won.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced down at the field. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men were back in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangar, talking to the two horsemen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What could be more probable than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ship, said by Conklin to be sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidized by Derringer, should be used for</seg><seg type="columnLine">illegal purposes at times? There might</seg><seg type="columnLine">even be machine guns available to mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rear seat. It had a scarf mount, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As he methodically unwound the</seg><seg type="columnLine">antenna his whole being was concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on but one thing, the saving of Tex.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless there seemed to be a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his brain which automatically worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, steadily putting the various ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in the situation in their proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">places. The abduction of MacDowell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a stroke of genuis--an excellent ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuse for Ivers to put $50,000 of the elder</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDowell's money in his pocket without</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as consulting with the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably Ivers had not figured on killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex until he had found out how much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two flyers knew. During the entire time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merchant had banked more or less on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full cooperation of Daly in an emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency, through the power of blackmail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The motive behind his machinations had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been partly revenge for something which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened in the past, and partly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to make a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. Between embezzling funds from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business, dealing in acreage, poker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the kidnaping, thrusting the blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all losses on conditions at Verona, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a million dollars seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small estimate of the sure money Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make in his position of trust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The antenna was out, now, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal fish at the end of it gleamed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlight. As Daly's hand found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key he pointed the De Haviland for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. His hand rested motionless on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending instrument for a moment, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, as his eyes swept the shadowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. For Verona, a white city under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon, seemed to be burning up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were three fires on the main street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the light of the flames the swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobs were like frightened ants scurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a ruined ant hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In wrecking the joints they started</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fires," Daly thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The field itself was a sight to strike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observer with awe. Derrick lights winked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boiler mouths shone red, and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">derrick floors men were toiling. Vehicles</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled over the roads with gleaming eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the work of the field went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was all part of the nightmare to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly. His only hope was a negative one</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to save MacDowell. For himself, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none. Once again his life, built on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten foundation, was about to crumble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That mask of a face was drawn as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over his key, and his eyes were like</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows showing the suffering within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He concentrated fiercely on his work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not hear his own signals, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, above the bellow of the Liberty</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sent out the Laredo call a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. Then he went to work, sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">his message slowly as the DH roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, a thousand feet high, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Daly. In air above Verona. MacDowell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> kidnaped by bandits one hour ago. Must be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> near river.

Get Henry Ivers, Derringer and Conklin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Notify Rangers, sheriff and so forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could waste no more time on send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. They would have the message; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio shack was open night and day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked down. He was over Mexico,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rio Grande a mile north of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As he banked around he made quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations while his eyes swept the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">for signs of an airplane. That civilian</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane might not heed his warning. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had guns it might be sent out to get him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would leave matters in excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape for Ivers and Derringer--and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned ship and a few bones tell no tales</seg><seg type="columnLine">of murder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bandits probably had not ridden</seg><seg type="columnLine">very fast. Fifteen miles, and only an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour had passed. They should be near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were! At least, there was a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horsemen, riding like mad, two miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">east of the little settlements on the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They aren't feeling as good as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive right now," Daly thought grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now what shall I do? With Tex in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of 'em I can't shoot so well."</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS circling over them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a mile from the river, riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mesquite. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strip of clearings, a half mile wide, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northern bank of the Rio Grande.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd have to come out in the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned south, a mile back of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifteen hundred feet high. He took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick look at his instruments. All was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well on those gages, from oil pressure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery charging rate. The twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder Liberty was bellowing along</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly, and he tried the switches absently</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he strove to form a plan. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">just follow them, spotting their location,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a couple of sparkplugs, fouled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil, would mean the ruin of all his plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dared not trust MacDowell's life to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man of one idea, he was so utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">engrossed in his thoughts that when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windshield shattered before his eyes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it, for the moment, in dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then his head snapped around, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the De Haviland into a dizzy vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank which seemed to almost break it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. Behind him, four hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than he, was the civilian ship. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back seat a man was standing, hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling a machine gun which was mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. That ship had taken off, sneaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, probably, to gain altitude, got</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than he was, and swooped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the night sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he was still in the back seat. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun control was in the front cockpit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cursed with cold venom as he twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ship once more. Only blind luck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved him from being shot down. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings had holes in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw his chance. The other ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">banking to give the back seat man a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to shoot. In an instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke's belt was off, and he had plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">head first into the front cockpit. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">DH faltered in a stall he grabbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick. He got to the seat, and as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped the belt he sent the bomber</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving madly through the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had one advantage--front guns to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim with the ship. They had altitude,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they had to present a broadside view</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give the machine vgunner a chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a big man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By God, I believe it's Henry Ivers!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Duke told himself slowly. "Going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get to Mexico if he doesn't shoot me</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two ships circled, their motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly shaking the earth as they roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">along at full speed. The Duke was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet and very calm now. He watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a hawk. He must spoil their shots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting his chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spots of fire came from the gun above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went into a dive, twisting as he dived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles *to their course. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser banked to keep him in range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They figured on getting him as he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">underneath them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a split second he changed his dive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">banking steeply to the left. Their course</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to the right. The DH was quiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the terrific speed of that full</seg><seg type="columnLine">power dive, and the Liberty's roar rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a mad bellow as the tachometer showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen hundred and fifty revolutions a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute and the airspeed hovered around</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred and fifteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced around. They were bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the left. In a moment the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be on him, but for a small interval</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time the ships would be too far apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">for accurate shooting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There he shot the dice with destruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without hesitation he lifted the frail</seg><seg type="columnLine">De Haviland upward in a clean arc. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up it went with that excess speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every second he expected to feel a bullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It started over on its back, five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet higher than it had been before. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder and stick, plus the feel of the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had made him a great pilot, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the DH'on its horizontal axis, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half roll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hanging upside'down, then sideward</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the ship answered, there came a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">when there loomed before his sights the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of the other ship. It had twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, reversing its course. As his DH</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his hand was pressed down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun control, and his front guns were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spraying lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How he did it he did not know, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as the DH was turning he kept its</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose pointed at the other ship. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser passed out of range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Right side up, stalled, he looked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. He was as high as they were now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was higher!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were below him and seemed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. The cruiser turned loggily,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To hell with you," he said to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with icy calmness, and dived on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw his tracers travel almost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the ship, and then he scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched it as it spun earthward. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already on his way toward those gallop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing horsemen, who were just entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, when the cruiser hurtled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and a great ball of fire lit up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth for miles around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would the bandits give up now? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered. Probably not. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know that Ivers himself had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ship, largely for the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a clean getaway. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured on getting Daly with those first</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And they nearly did!" he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he felt hope bounding in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. He was a half mile to one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bunched riders. He sent the DH</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward in:a fast dive, pointed at them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The motor sputtered. Had some bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken effect in it? God, he must hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That roar didn't sound right. Sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was close to them, flying at two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles and a half a minute, only five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What he had thought might happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. Those frightened horses were now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of crazed bucking broncos, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">control, as the ship flashed toward them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One rider was on the ground. The rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them to a man were fighting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses.	,]</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as Daly zoomed up over them he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Tex MacDowell, with the skill born</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his ranch boyhood, guide his maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony northward like a frightened rabbit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a hundred yard start--no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that. Suddenly Daly was aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the DH was stalling. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed forward on the stick as the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtered and died. It always died,</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily, in an extreme stall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as he got the ship into a dive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regain flying speed it did not catch again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next second blue flame was playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the motor. The gas line had broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooding the hot Liberty. A bullet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakened it, doubtlessly; but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afire, six hundred feet in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow it seemed unimportant. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the ship into a sideslip as a wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat blistered him. His right wing, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pointed upward in the slip, was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready being eaten by flames. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he was not too uncomfortable as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flames blew upward and away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His eyes were on the ground. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to hold his goggles to keep the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific airstream, coming upward at him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a result of the slip, from tearing them off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was Tex, going like mad for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mesquite. One lone rider was</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him, and gaining. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were huddled near the river, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwilling to separate themselves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their nearness to Mexico and safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If there was left in Duke Daly any</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of selfishness or fear or dross of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind, it was burned away during that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment when he hung beneath a tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quil night sky in his flaming De Haviland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The second he pointed its nose down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">draft would blow the fire back on him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fuselage would turn into a flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffin. By sideslipping to the ground, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance for life. Down below, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whose place could never be taken in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life of Duke Daly was fleeing for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and losing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The DH was three hundred feet high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing altitude steadily. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious look in Daly's eyes as he took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep breath of the last pure air he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever breathe. Pain was gone from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shadows had lifted, and it was as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were seeing visions as he brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's nose down and started the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a split second his eyes were burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his clothes charring. Heat rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him in a sickening wave. His bleary</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes never wavered, however, and pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was non-existent. He did not breathe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would not fill his lungs with smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fire yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had his bead. Dazed, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeling, he sent a hail of death down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursuing bandit, and not until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandit had toppled from his horse did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly's hand leave the gun control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifty feet from the ground. Now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was a torturing shell. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaning as he lifted the ship in a side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip. He gulped in air as he rammed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomber downward with top rudder. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">unloosened his belt. Perhaps he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be thrown clear of the fire--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a crash, and he felt himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling through the air. The next second</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain became a ball of fire which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinguished in an instant and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE DID not know it, but Tex had</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled back as his pursuer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen from his horse, and his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beat out the slowly burning spots in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly's clothing. Ten minutes later a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laredo ship had arrived, and carried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the hospital. It was there he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself, next morning, thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandaged and listless from the effects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">opiates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had he opened his eyes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nurse came in, followed by Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowell. The big Texan was unshaven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty as a roustabout, but the old grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOMSON BURTIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there and there was a sparkle in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes which took no heed of fatigue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You probably don't feel so good, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel fine," he drawled. "They say you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right--burns not so damn' serious*</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lungs O.K."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly smiled briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is everything in the oil village?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked weakly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so bad. Did you know that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship you shot down had Hank Ivers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh-huh, I thought so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me what happened up there first</seg><seg type="columnLine">after I left," Tex commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was sitting on the edge of the bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his glowing eyes were hard for Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet. Daly told the story briefly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">haltingly, and MacDowell's eyes grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter all the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said slowly, "I guess, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact, that there were only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of people who knew about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitzpatrick incident. One was Ivers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other this head bandit that had me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge. He was enjoying himself so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much I was scared of what would happen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest of 'em were just supers. Dumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">spigs, in for a little money. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he talked, tjiis blond boy--you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member we saw him on the street--was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">follower of Dave Fitzpatrick's, and to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, who'd got Dave put in jail, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pleasure. Between him and Ivers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from what you said, I'd have had a nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Laredo got my message all right, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. And found the town in a hell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mess. The sheriff's there now with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big posse. I guess he isn't happy. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to let these oil towns alone--but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be done. The boys here say you</seg><seg type="columnLine">told 'em to get Conklin and Derringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hold 'em. Well, they found Slats</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly wounded. Some guy he'd rooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a pot shot at him in the fights, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he alive?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, but nobody knows whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll live or not," Tex said without sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row. "I tipped off the sheriff and, sick or</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sick, they gave him the third degree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't need much. He figures he's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goner and came pretty clean. Admits</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything, including airplane smuggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the side, except that he was not in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kidnaping at all and had nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with it. It was Ivers' cute little idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have dad pay him fifty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he hadn't spent, see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's that little banty rooster, Conk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin?" inquired Daly, and for a second a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real grin was on his pallid, drawn face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex laughed long and loud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He admitted what he was up to, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little squirt was pretty near right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd been about ruined by Derringer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked work, and he aimed to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to live by fair means or foul. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want us messing in just at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment when he started to take Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer for a ride. They let him go, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess--nothing on him that isn't taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">for granted in a town like that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly felt better. Somehow it always</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a feeling of contentment to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tex around. It was great to have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor of some sort, somebody to tie to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was busy figuring things out more in</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Assuming that this bandit I killed--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He had the poker money, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got!" Tex interrupted with a grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good. Anyway, assuming that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tickled to be in on the deal just to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at a patrolman who'd put his boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">in jail, how do you explain Ivers? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure poison."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dad's coming down in a week," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated. "Wired me, in answer to mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it must have its root in some business</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal where dad got the best of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably partly just the money angle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. Dad said he was always a penny</seg><seg type="columnLine">pincher, and through that lost out on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of stuff around Texas in the past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You never can tell about these fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">year grudges. They get big when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of 'em all that time. Dad fights</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, but he fights clean. I know that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Also," nodded the Duke, "all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder and stuff he was driven to. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DUKE AND THE DUCATS</seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg><seg type="columnLine">a guy starts to steal and the gun's around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder isn't far away and the deeper he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets the longer lengths he'll go to to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are," drawled MacDowell</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he got to his feet. "It's my hunch he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have shrunk from killing in real horror at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the start. But this bandit guy--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at me and licking his chops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those breeds--and he is one--are tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to figure. Resent the inferior blood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em, and are run by it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave Daly a cigaret, lighted one for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, and strolled to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get out before they kick me out,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he announced. "See you this afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything's jake, and don't worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers, if you get what I mean. Ivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bandit are both out of the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your memoirs won't be published."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly smiled and took a deep breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blow which would have knocked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight of the world he loved would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fall--not yet, anyhow. Some day it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would, probably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And say, Duke," MacDowell said</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually. "Thanks for the help last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes were on his cigaret. Daly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on his, examining the ash critically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Everything came out great,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said evenly, "even to the acreage, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derringer confessed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are," Tex said a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">huskily.

He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit for hours, tilted back in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken chair against the shady side of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">little office, knees almost touching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin, his long, thin face serious over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of reducing a piece of soft pine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin shavings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck was the sheriff of Mojave Wells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mojave Wells was a heat and sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoured, false fronted town in Road Run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner Valley. The town was invisible from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance, because even the painted signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the business houses had been. sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted until they were unreadable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the end of the roundup in Road</seg><seg type="columnLine">Runner Valley, and Buck knew that be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore night the town would be filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty cowboys, whose overall pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lined with money, and that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky met cowboy there might be plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of work for the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The first to arrive was Ben Dolan, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thin faced, gaunt sort of cowboy, astride</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a weary looking roan. Instead of heading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a saloon, Ben dismounted in front of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff's office, dropped his reins in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the dirt and sat down beside the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hyah, Buck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Purty good," drawled Buck squinting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at his handiwork. "Whatcha know,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ben?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"In kin da early, ain't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ben made a few marks in the sand with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a lean forefinger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Had a reason t' come in early, Buck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Some of the boys said it wouldn't do no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good, but I thought I'd tell you how it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was.

They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">also imbibe freely, and some of 'em will</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely get kinda drunk. The boys are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty, you know. I expect it'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinda wooly around here t'night, Buck."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Uh-huh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck cut a particularly long shaving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it critically and nodded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shore rode in early to explain all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to me," he said. "If you're all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, you might tell me the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's thisaway," explained Ben serious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "You know what a feud is. Buck?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yea-a-ah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that's what she amounts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now. And it's all over a danged</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad there's a reason, Ben. Mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alius them feuds starts over nothin'.

You know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bud and Pete kinda shined around her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month ago. I don't guess she knowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">which one to pick. Of course, Bud thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's him, and Pete thinks it's him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there you are. It's been kinda achin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of 'em, I reckon. Anyway, Chuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lester makes a remark the other night</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he supposed Bud wouldn't be with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in Mojave Wells at the finish of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundup, 'cause he'd stop along a picket</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence before he reached the main street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and head straight through the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pete was there, and I reckon it hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in a sore spot, 'cause he chips in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remark, which didn't set well with Bud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There wasn't much said, but it took all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us to take their guns away. We didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want no killin' in camp. Bud was reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. He says to Pete, 'We'll settle this</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Mojave Wells.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pete was agreeable. He says, 'That</seg><seg type="columnLine">suits me. We'll make a truce until sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, both agreein' to keep away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. When that sun goes down, all truce</seg><seg type="columnLine">is off, and we shoot on sight.' "</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUCK sliced another shaving, laid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick aside and began whetting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade on the counter of his left boot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And one of them damn' fools is goin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get killed," added Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's kinda hard to git straight grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff these days," said the sheriff 'serious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "I 'member when I was runnin' a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tradin' post down Yuma way, I used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">git the best danged boxwood for whittlin'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't suppose it runs so good these</seg><seg type="columnLine">days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ben and Pete are both friends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours," said Ben thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh-huh. I like 'em both."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A killin' might start trouble. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys has kinda took sides."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I s'pose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bud and Pete are both good shots."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yea-a-ah--purty good shots. Awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn' fools in lotsa ways, but good</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots. Uh-hu-u-uh. Well, I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">write me some signs, Ben. It's two hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">till sundown."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought you'd like to know about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, Sheriff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, I do. Thank you kindly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're welcome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben took his horse and headed for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon, while more cowboys came racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, their horses covered with lather and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. The sheriff watched the first con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingent arrive. It was Bud Hickman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gang from the Tumbling K. Bud was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a likable looking cowboy, about twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years of age, tall, lithe, swarthy as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian, with curling black hair and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white toothed smile. His crew was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild riding lot of hard bitted punchers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for fun or fight at a moment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They noted that Pete Asher and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">J88 boys had not arrived yet; so they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for the Desert Well Saloon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biggest place of its kind in Mojave Wells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sheriff stood on the edge of the side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk for a while, cogitating deeply. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sheriff of that particular county</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly two terms, which meant that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck Brady was pretty much of a man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he went into his little office, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a search he found an old paint brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">•t'2</seg><seg type="columnLine">W. C. TUTTLE</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few ounces of almost dried paint</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a battered can. He kicked the ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a soap box, drew out the nails and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat. down at his desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete Asher and his crew rode in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the J88, tied their horses farther up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street and entered the Prospect Saloon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asher 'was a heavily built, hard faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy, about the same age as Bud Hick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. His hair was almost a neutral</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade, his eyes deep set and blue. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little to choose between his gang and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one which came in with Bud Hick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and in numbers they were about</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were more outfits to come, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not connected with the feud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bud and his men were at the bar when</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 he sheriff came in, and they greeted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisily. He was carrying a box end and</seg><seg type="columnLine">;• hammer, and without any leave from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proprietor he proceeded to nail his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign to one of the walls. It read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     FROM NOW ON EVERY MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     MUST TURN HIS GUN OVER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     TO MY OFFICE UNTIL HE IS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     READY TO LEAVE TOWN.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          BY ORDER OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          --BUCK BRADY.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOME of the men laughed: some</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore. Bud Hickman strode over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sheriff and glared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">belligerently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You tryin' to kid somebody, Buck?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff looked steadily at Bud for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I ain't in the habit of ldddin' anybodv,</seg><seg type="columnLine">am I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bud flushed quickly, but he recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that Buck Brady would back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sign. That was why Buck was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kinda sudden, ain'teha?" asked Bud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No-o-o. I've been thinkin' this out</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a while, Bud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this the idea?" queried Bud. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">all turn our guns over to you, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn 'em back when we're ready to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">town ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what the sign says, Bud; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wrote the sign."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bud laughed and turned to his men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's all right, boys. Shuck your guns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reckon we can stand it, if the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">can." And then to the sheriff, "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have a little trouble with Pete and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gang."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope they'll be reasonable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men put their guns on a poker</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and the sheriff picked them up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting some in his pockets, some inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waistband of his overalls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll have to remember your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, boys," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon I can spot mine," said Bud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I made them handles."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHERIFF thanked them kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went back to his office, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked the guns in his desk. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went over to the Prospect Saloon, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he nailed up his other notice. Asher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men didn't take so kindly to the idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them were openly belligerent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it seemed for a few moments that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff had a tough job, but Asher took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter out of their hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose this thing only applies to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and my men, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're supposin' wrong, Pete; I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">already collected from the Tumblin' K."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've collected from Bud Hick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I jist wondered. But suppose we</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't give you our guns?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff considered Pete calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've alius liked you, Asher. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a damn' fool in lotsa ways, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're jist human like the rest of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've posted my notice, and I wrote it</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But jist suppose we refuse to give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">our guns?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," said the sheriff calmly, "would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be jist too damn' bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh--" softly--"and if I should hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen to want to leave town, you'd give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me back my gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Jist like the sign says, Pete."</seg><seg type="columnLine">BY ORDER OF BUCK BRADY</seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right; here's mine. Take 'em off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys. We don't need 'em--now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff looked over the guns as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited them about his person; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked out, swinging the hammer in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't that beat hell?" laughed Pete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll betcha somebody told him some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin'," said a cowboy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like the idea of a moth eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">old sidewinder takin' my gun away,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">complained a cowboy who was new to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country. "We'd 'a' had some fun, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd refused."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got a sweet idea of fun,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Pete. "That moth eaten old</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewinder is jist thirty-two years old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if we hadn't turned them guns over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him he'd jist about ruined the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang of us with his pet Winchester. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see 'By order of Buck Brady,' you</seg><seg type="columnLine">better read the upper part of it and act</seg><seg type="columnLine">accordingly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ALL THE cowboys went back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">/-% their drinking, and the sheriff was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten, but both Bud and Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept track of the sun. The sheriff, humped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his chair, still whittling, saw Pete come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, saunter to the hitching rack, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could view the sun. It was still an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben Dolan, fairly well filled with liquor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over again and squatted on his heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the sheriff. Ben was as hard bitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the rest of the cowboys, but he liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">both Bud and Pete so well that he hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see either of them wounded or killed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Ben was wise enough to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that both men would claim their guns at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sundown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They saw Bud leave the Desert Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saloon, walk halfway across the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if heading for a store, stop and look</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the west. He too was keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases on the sun. Then he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the saloon. Ben made</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningless marks in the sand with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">forefinger, while the sheriff whittled</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shore collected a lot of guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yea-a-ah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Almost sundown."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff shut one eye and considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben. Then he looked toward both</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloons, and went on whittling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boys are gettin' nervous, " said Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I notice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several cowboys were standing in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Prospect Saloon now, and one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them essayed a clog dance. His boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded loud on the old wooden side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. Another beat time on a porch post</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the end of a quirt. It was like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating of a tomtom, and he kept it up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time after the dancer had stopped. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">beater was swarthy, with high cheekbones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of Bud's gang came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desert Well and stood around in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building. One of them, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunker than the rest, started across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street toward the sheriff's office, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others stopped him and, after an argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, persuaded him to desist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's kinda sultry," said Ben, rubbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff nodded and looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, only half of which was visible now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He blinked from the strong light and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">several shavings, which did not suit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. A couple of dogs met in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the street; town dogs, fat and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship of long standing. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they growled ominously at each other, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they circled, looking for an opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sic 'em!" hissed a cowboy from in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the Desert Well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take him, Tige! Shake his fleas</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. Four bits on the yaller one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've done made a bet, cowboy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Choose him, Ponto."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the dogs only circled and growled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally separated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mebbe they're waitin' for the sun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go down," whispered Ben.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got more sense than men have."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUN was down. Only the tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">was visible, and the crests of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken hills showed a golden high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. It was very still in Mojave Wells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shadows were gone now and the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg><seg type="columnLine">W. C. TUTTLE</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed with a yellow light, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not last long. Twilight was unknown in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mojave Wells. Sundown, a streak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, would quickly fade to blue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bud Hickman came from the Desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well and went straight to the hitch rack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he untied his horse and swung into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle. Simultaneously with Bud's</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, Pete Asher came riding from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack beside the Prospect. It was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual move. They intended to deceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody, not even the sheriff of Mojave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells. The cowboys of both outfits were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the street, watching intently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bud came straight to the sheriff, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet behind him was Pete. Bud's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was grim, his mouth set in a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm pullin' out, Buck," he said softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you mind handin' me my gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff stopped whittling, tilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in his chair and got slowly to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He looked closely at Bud, but said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, as he turned and went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. Pete moved in closer, but he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bud ignored each other. Ben sighed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff came out, carrying a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each hand. For several moments he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the two men rather sorrowfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon you're pullin' out, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain'tcha, Pete?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete nodded quickly and held out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand for the gun. They had been friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two, until a woman had come be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them. Bud holstered his gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung his horse around and rode slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the street, looking straight ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete accepted his gun, glanced at it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that it was fully loaded, snapped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in his holster and swung his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, riding back to the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben swore softly under his breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both of these men were good revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goin' to be a funeral around here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--mebbe two," he muttered. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">don'tcha stop it, Buck? Gawd A'mighty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ain't right! Look at Bud--he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">turnin'!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You didn't expect he'd run away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didja?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The contestants in this desert town</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama were two hundred feet apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing each other, both horses moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. They had both played a square</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. There was no advantage now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two hundred feet is a long shot. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had drawn their guns. Bud's horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dancing a little, and he spurred it</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben's hands were gripping the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. He had seen gun fights</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, but they had all been unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditated affairs. This one was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like an execution. The groups of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboys were as immobile as dummy</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures. Even the horses at the hitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">racks had ceased moving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bud and Pete were closing the gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them, closing it slowly, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the other to make the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">move with a gun. They were only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet apart now. It was close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. But neither of them made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">move to lift his gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ninety feet; thirty yards. Either of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them could hit a tomato can at that dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. Eighty feet! Horses walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. Seventy feet; sixty feet. Twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards now. They were almost in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sheriff's office. Ben laughed fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishly. It would be a double funeral. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen Bud shoot the head from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie dog at that distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a nice evenin' for it," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff rather inanely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it happened!</seg><seg type="columnLine">BOTH guns came up at exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same instant.

Bud's eyes jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. The two riders were thirty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, leaning forward in their saddles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a shot had been fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a swift movement, Bud Hickman</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung out the cylinder of his Colt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptied the cartridges in his hand. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">BY ORDER OF BUCK BRADY</seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">primer had been dented. There were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marks on the bullets, marks made by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jaws of a pair of pliers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Pete was swearing viciously, as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drew cartridges from his belt and started</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to stuff them in his gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But the sheriff halted him with a sharp</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Damn you, you pulled the powder on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my shells!" snarled Pete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Yeah; and I'll pull somethin' else out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of you, if you make one more move,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> said the sheriff calmly. "C'mere, Bud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Bud rode up to him, still holding the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> empty gun in his hand. Pete had quit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> trying to load his gun. They looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> coldly at each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> . "You boys hadn't ort to fight," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the sheriff calmly. "Both of you goin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> off kinda half cocked, as you might say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The men from both outfits had moved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in close now, trying to understand what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was all about, their enmity all but for-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gotten in this queer turn of events.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I pulled them bullets," admitted the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sheriff.

Across its farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">end flowed the Me Mai, still muddy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">t he recent rains. On a high limb of a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottonwood tree rising from the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, two grotesque hornbills carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their amours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield stretched his long, angular</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms luxuriously and inhaled the opiate</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragrance of the slender white blossoms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dawlc cham pee.

A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">teak log floated lazily on its muddy surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A faint smile twitched the corners of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm mouth. He ran his long fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his thin, sandy hair. That log</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a straggler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the preceding forty-eight hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a rain the like of which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been heard of in years, and more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty thousand logs that had been lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dry bed of the stream for eight years</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been floated out to the river and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">g-he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> WHITE</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHITE ELEPHANT</seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the way to Bangkok. In those few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had justified his recent transfer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Me Mai. He had succeeded where others</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed. It had meant almost thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of' constant toil, but it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished, and fourteen hours of sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep had put him in the best of spirits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was ten o'clock in the morning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy was just removing the breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes. Sommerfield had decided to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day off. He would inspect no logs. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would break his way through no jungle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would rest, read his mail and get what</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure there was in life for a jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">walla exiled from civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When the breakfast dishes had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed, the boy brought out the stack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail that a carrier had brought from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chiengmai the day before. Sommerfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been too tired to read them then, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at them hungrily as the boy placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the table. He crossed the tanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees between his shorts and golf hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and settled himself for a comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His feeling of satisfaction and content-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was dispelled by the first letter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">read. It was a letter from Hodgkins in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bangkok. At varying intervals Hodgkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to all members of the company a copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his Further India Teak Tirade, a breezy</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter giving the news and gossip of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est to every member of the company. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter which Sommerfield opened was</seg><seg type="columnLine">written in a more serious vein than was</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitual with Hodgkins. The first para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph was as follows:</seg><seg type="columnLine">TEAK WALLAS TO BE DISCHARGED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Yesterday it became known that the rumors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which have been afloat for the past two months</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> are confirmed. The lease on the Prae Jungle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which was denied the Further India Corpora-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tion on the ground that the government would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> itself extract the teak, has been granted to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Compagnie General d'Extreme Oriente.

As only two men can be used in Burma,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the jungle wallas may expect to have home leave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and discharges within the next two years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield reread the paragraph. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it was not official, but he also</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it contained more truth than</seg><seg type="columnLine">poetry. He cursed the day he had signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with the company and cursed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for not resigning years before, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been able to get into some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other kind of work. For twelve years he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given the company his all, and now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be turned out with no hope for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">E CURSED the government.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A bunch of fools clutching for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straw like a drowning man," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered.

Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright spreads to the people and the rulers</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear insurrections conjured up by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own imaginations. Damn them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pictured himself in England looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a position. He knew he was not fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for work at home even if he could find it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His years in the jungle had made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">"jungle shy". He was afraid of people. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent the Christmas holidays on hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips with some other jungle loallas, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he was afraid of the crowds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered at Chiengmai and Lampang</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the holidays. He knew he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be terrified if he had to accept a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a place where there would be a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His last home leave had been pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way, and yet the only times he felt at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease were those when he was in a big arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair in a corner of the club, talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another jungle man, who was also on</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy!" shouted Sommerfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy appeared from behind the tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whisky soda."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy disappeared and in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLARK BROCKMAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back with the bottles and a glass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sommerfield poured himself a stiff drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gulped it down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy's eyes opened in amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Nai drinks, yes, but he does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">go at it with both feet in the trough as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans do," he said to himself.

The lurid details of the strike in</seg><seg type="columnLine">England, and the general unemployment</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation offered a strange fascination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was.reading a description of how col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lege students were running the busses in</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, when one of the men from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant camp rushed into the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, Father Eclipse of the Moon is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">must.

He was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge of the work on the Me Mai.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Father Eclipse of the Moon was the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusker who had succeeded in breaking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacks of logs that had formed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream during the high water and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it possible to float the logs down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river.

One of them, with a light bam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boo, got his pole too near the elephant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.

The move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the foot was delayed a fraction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second. During that moment, Nai Kow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had caught the man's foot, jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out to safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Father Eclipse of the Moon, robbed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his prey, became more violent, and slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly with his pole. The men were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready out of range. Bellowing and roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he whirled the pole above his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurled it at the group. His aim was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad and the pole missed the men by several</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He was still as far from the noose as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and another strand had been broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield ordered the men to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and Red Moon moved the noose</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Father Eclipse of the Moon lunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward again. The fifth strand gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way under the tremendous pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run for your lives!" shouted Sommer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLARK BROCKMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warning was useless. The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already disappearing. The Britisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he was in greater danger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others. He could not reach the cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle before the tusker would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him. A house would be of no protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, as Father Eclipse of the Moon could</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock it to a pulp in one charge and Som-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merfield could not climb a tree like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barefoot native. He looked for a tree that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy to climb and yet strong enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand under the charges of an infuri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The rope!" shouted Red Moon, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the rope hanging from a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">tying tree a few yards away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield ran for it, made all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height he could on his jump, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboriously up toward the branches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something caught his legs and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted a full two feet. It was Red Moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his hands under the soles of Sommer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field's feet, he helped again. TheBritisher's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand caught the limb. He raised his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrapped them about-it affectionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he raised his chin above the branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild trumpet of rage echoed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. Sommerfield saw that the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusker had broken loose from the tree and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gazing around as if bewildered, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk outstretched and his ears cocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry," whispered Sommerfield.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TUSKER caught sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangling figure, and with another</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpet, charged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Red Moon was coming up the rope like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monkey. Sommerfield braced himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the branches, reached down, caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider's hand and with one jerk swung him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the branch, as the elephant's extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk caught the rope and snapped it as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been a piece of twine. Furiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Father Eclipse of the Moon charged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. It shook, but held. Again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant charged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He can't get us," panted Red Moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This will never come down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tusker tried again and bellowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the distance, Sommerfield caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take your elephants away! Father</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eclipse of the Moon is loose. Flee!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Father Eclipse of the Moon also heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cry, and made off in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound. As he passed a sapling he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped it as if it had been a reed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared into the jungle, waving it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both Sommerfield and Red Moon sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless listening to the crashing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undergrowth. When the noise of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge was no longer audible they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">still hear an occasional trumpet and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry bellow. Even these sounds died</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the distance. Slowly they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and as they did, they saw the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping from trees and emerging from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding wall of jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nai Kow was the first to arrive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Send for Sewai," ordered Sommer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. "Tell him to bring his poisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows and shoot Father Eclipse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon. Tell him that I will give him ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticals more than the usual price if he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">him today, but also tell him that I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">want the elephant shot full of arrows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just in the foot and just enough to cripple</seg><seg type="columnLine">him temporarily. You understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kow chai--understood," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to one of the men and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orders, telling the man to make all</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sewai is not at home," broke in a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield turned to see who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking. It was Panya, the aged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriveled spirit doctor, who was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what of a demigod in the district, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his supposed control over the legions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil spirits that daily harassed the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. Sommerfield had known Panya</seg><seg type="columnLine">for years and had had long and interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">talks with the old man on the subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits and exorcism. Panya was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">charlatan. He was a real student of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">profession and honestly believed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">amulets and formulas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Sewai?" asked Sommerfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has gone to shoot Paa Luang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chow Rajaboot's tusker who has been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">must for the past two weeks and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHITE ELEPHANT</seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg><seg type="columnLine">already killed two men, wrecked a village</seg><seg type="columnLine">and killed one of the prince's best ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phants and gored several others. As long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Paa Luang only killed men and wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages, the choio did not bother about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but when he started killing other</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephants, the chow became excited. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Sewai to shoot him immediately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That elephant is a devil at all times, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he is on must he is worse than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit tiger. He will kill anything he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When did Sewai start out to find Paa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luang?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only about an hour ago. He ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the elephant today, because when last</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, Paa Luang was not far away and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming in this direction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield turned to Red Moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go find Sewai and tell him I will give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him fifteen ticals extra if he cripples</seg><seg type="columnLine">Father Eclipse of the Moon before night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AFTER a few questions as to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sewai might be found, Red Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">started off hurriedly. The camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been deserted, now assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its normal appearance. The men sat in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle discussing the rage and fierceness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great tusker. T^ie men told Panya of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his terrible strength and how he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken loose. The stories they told were</seg><seg type="columnLine">such wonderful fabrications that Sommer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field stayed to listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the tale was nearing completion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon, the rider of a quiet female elephant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed up breathlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bua Kam calved this morning and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf is an albino!" he exclaimed. "She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not let me get close to touch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf, but. I could see the hairs on his tail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are white, as white as cooked rice!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The group of natives stared at Boon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had announced the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. They were incredulous, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered, stunned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true, Nai Som-er-fee," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to the Britisher. "It is true. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I was crazy when I first saw it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rubbed the eyes. I pounded the head. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked again. The hairs on the tail are</seg><seg type="columnLine">white! And there are five toes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right front foot. I saw them, too. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole body is pinkish and covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">white hairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you get your opium?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Sommerfield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nai Som-er-fee, I do not smoke opium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sell my allowance of opium every month.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is true. Come and see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield knew that it was possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the calf was a white elephant, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">albino, as the Siamese word should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">translated; but he also knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances against its being a white elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more than a thousand to one. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a white elephant, he knew it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling event--an event important</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to bolster up the tottering desti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nies of the government. He recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter from Hodgkins. "Unless the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany can do something to ingratiate itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the government--" Ingratiate itself?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it were really a white elephant, the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany could get anything it wanted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be discharged. He would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to look for a situation in England.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment Sommerfield saw a long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant career as a jungle walla stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out before him and then put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought out of his mind. Why raise false</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nai Som-er-fee, I believe Boon is tel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling the truth," said Panya, the spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. "Many omens have foretold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth. You have just witnessed the last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Father Eclipse of the Moon is the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant's sire. You have seen an exhibi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of strength and power which, to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge, no elephant has ever dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">played. This morning Father Eclipse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moon went on must and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the young elephant.was born. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodigious strength of the great tusker</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the strength of Buddha. The white</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant will be as strong as his father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the king will be as much greater than</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men as Father Eclipse of the Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">is greater than other elephants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have noticed other omens. Prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably Nai Som-er-fee did not notice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days ago there was a large white</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud in the eastern sky which took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a white elephant. The head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLARK BROCKMAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully formed and at first the trunk hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with a slight curl at the tip; but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I watched, the trunk curled over the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head as if the cloud elephant were saluting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king. As the sun set, the whole body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cloud elephant was changed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep pink, which, Nai Som-er-fee knows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the real color of an albino elephant. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail remained white long after the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body had been colored by the rays of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the setting sun, and I doubt not that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be found that there are white hairs on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true," broke in Boon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if his tail is white," continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panya, "he is a white elephant in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other qualities he may lack. Nai</seg><seg type="columnLine">Som-er-fee has heard the old proverb:</seg><seg type="columnLine">'When buying an elephant study his tail;</seg><seg type="columnLine">when buying a wife, study her mother.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That, Nai Som-er-fee, was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">omen. Then, that night, there was a rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the like of which has not been heard of in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this region for a hundred years. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no stint to Buddha's generosity. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been told that your company floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">out logs that have been lying in the bed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Me Mai for over ten years. That rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded rice fields that were parched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it will flood rice fields from here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Krung Tape--Bangkok--as it flows down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After such a rain as that to usher in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his representative, would God Buddha</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us an elephant that is only partially</seg><seg type="columnLine">white? I have not seen, Nai Som-er-fee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I believe that the elephant is white, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon has told us. I believe that the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">king has great merit and that God is</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing his approval by sending an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant perfect in all eight points. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">also showing his approval of the company</seg><seg type="columnLine">by having his representative arrive in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd. The company has great merit."</seg><seg type="columnLine">OMMERFIELD smiled in apprecia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the old man's corfipliment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nai Panya, how does this show</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Buddha approves of the new king?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The ancient tradition says that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a white elephant born in the kingdom</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever a new king comes to the throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if that king has the approval of God</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddha. It he does not have the approval,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no white elephant is born. The white</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant is therefore the representative of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddha. Some say that it is Buddha</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself coming in the form of an elephant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I doubt that. That Buddha did come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth once in the form of a white ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant is beyond question--every priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tell you that--but that was many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In ancient times the king sent princes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escort the white elephant to his palace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A gorgeous hall was erected in the palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds for his abode. Dancing girls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">musicians were in constant attendance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was fed by slaves in splendid uniforms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who offered him food on platters of silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold. A body of priests were appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to chant prayers before him and also to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him instruction in conduct and man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners. Singers from the royal opera sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to sleep. He was treated as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddha himself might be treated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the late king forgot the ways of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ancestors and the white elephants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were put in stables and lacked attention--</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, so I have been told. He died a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man. But Buddha is honoring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new king, and the birth of this elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">proves that the new king has great merit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have heard people say he was unworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">because no white elephant was born, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now here is the proof of Buddha's favor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who dares doubt now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a murmur of approval</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the old man finished speaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After waiting a few moments the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit doctor continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some time ago Nai Som-er-fee told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was no significance in names.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He told me that I was not wise simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">because my name Panya, means 'Wise'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he will say that Bua Kam--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon-white Lotus--the name of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother elephant, has no connection with</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving birth to a white elephant. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will say that Nai Boon, the rider, is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky although his name means luck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am indeed lucky, Nai Som-er-fee,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Boon' his frank young face all aglow</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHITE ELEPHANT</seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes shining with excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Princes and nobles will come for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant.

The king will give me a uniform and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe presents of silver and gold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall go to see this calf and deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine whether it is a white elephant or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not," said Sommerfield. "One look is</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than many omens, Nai Panya."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bai; bai! Let's go; let's go!" shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men in chorus, but Boon interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nai Som-er-fee, I met a man who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his way to the temple. I told him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news and asked him to send the priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">here as soon as possible. Would Nai be</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to wait for them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield was eager to see the cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monies that would be performed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">assented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The priests are necessary," said Pan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ya. "We shall all do obeisance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young elephant, and then the priests will</seg><seg type="columnLine">say prayers for his health and wisdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they have finished I will chant</seg><seg type="columnLine">incantations to drive out all evil spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">that may hurt him or cause him to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick. Every care must be taken for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">health, else we may be severely punished</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the king. If he should die before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets to Bangkok, we would indeed lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">merit. The king will wreak vengeance</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon every one of us. It is an honor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a white elephant for the king, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a dead one is disaster."</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS not long before the priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the clearing. They came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">single file with the old patriarch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple leading the procession. Immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately behind him was an acolyte carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">his elaborately embroidered ceremonial</seg><seg type="columnLine">fan, haversack, and betelnut box. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">these came four other priests with acolytes</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying their ceremonial equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A group of novices dressed like their</seg><seg type="columnLine">seniors in brilliant yellow robes came next.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Last of all came the villagers, men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, and children, all in their holiday</seg><seg type="columnLine">attire. They made a colorful picture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with panungs -- trousers--and pasins--</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts--of every color of the rainbow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many of them carried great silver bowls</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with scented water and sweet smell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flowers. The priests were given the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of honor in the group, the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled with those present, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children formed a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">group a little distance away, but close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to hear the conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the new arrivals rested, Nai Panya</seg><seg type="columnLine">told of the omens he had noticed, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon described the young elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bai," said Sommerfield, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had time to rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bai," shouted the men, and off they</seg><seg type="columnLine">started with Boon leading the procession,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sommerfield next, and the others fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing in the order of their rank. Boon</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a trail leading to the stream, crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and headed for the salt lick about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile from camp. He skirted the clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started up the ridge behind it. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broiling hot, and the villagers straggled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path, panting. Through the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen the outline of Bua Kam, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother elephant. She had heard them</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming and was headed in their direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tinee dee quoi. Here is better." said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd protested. They wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the white elephant. They had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to look through the trees at the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an old one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is in a very bad humor," exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon. "She almost charged me this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning when I went close."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An argument followed. It was settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Sommerfield, who announced that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Panya, Boon, and Kow, the headman</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the camp, would go closer to determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether or not it was really a white ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four started forward quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boomp!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bua Kam slapped her trunk on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground so fiercely it sounded as if some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had broken the biggest drum in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village temple.

In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of a tree lay the calf. It was of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale red color and seemed to be covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with light fuzz. Its toenails were white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were five on each hind foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of the customary four. On its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail the larger hairs stood out, white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff. The eyes were closed so it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to tell their color; but whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were black or pink made no differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. The calf was an albino--a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant, a representative of Buddha, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">indubitable warrant of a favored king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think he needs water," whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sommerfield. "See how he is panting."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, water. He has no water. God</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddha, he has.no water." Boon's whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per was hoarse as if he also needed water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We must bring water. Here &gt;on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge there is nowaterand the little onecan</seg><seg type="columnLine">not walk down the steep hill. She can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry him and will not leave him to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. GodBuddha! Ifheshouldperish!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a wild animal he darted noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly through the bushes to the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the priests were waiting. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sommerfield arrived, a prayer service for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little elephant was in progress. Seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a decaying log, his ceremonial fan</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his face to prevent thoughts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mundane things from creeping into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, was the head priest. On the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him with elbows on the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms together in the attitude^ of prayer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the brown villagers. Heads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed low to the ground or thrown back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with faces uplifted to the leafy dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by the great jungle monarchs whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches spread out between them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nirvana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prayer after prayer fell fervently from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shriveled lips of the aged priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the priest had finished his pleas</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the mercy of Buddha, Panya, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit doctor, took charge of affairs as</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally as if it were a part of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">service, as indeed it was. The priest saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing incongruous in it. Why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Panya's tactics were totally differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent. His was not the attitude of a sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pliant coming to a greater power for help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood before the spirits of the jungles</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shoulders back and head up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">called them by name, dared them to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as a finger upon him who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their master. He reminded them that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit he controlled was greater than they,</seg><seg type="columnLine">singly or collectively. He recounted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous deeds and threatened to bind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and tie them for eternity if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not accede to his will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ordered all spirits of disease and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity away from Bua Kam and the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant. He called in the thirty-two</seg><seg type="columnLine">good elements which are necessary to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">health of men and animals alike. Spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">after spirit was called upon and ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perform certain duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The angry bellow of an elephant broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the stillness of the jungle. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not Bua Kam. It was from the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite direction. The animal trumpeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bellowed again. The confident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">haughty expression on Panya's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be frozen there. He stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulously in the direction of the noise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some jungle spirit was evidently dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">puting his authority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd was in a panic. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the crash-crash, as the elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke wildly through the jungle. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another trumpet. With one accord</seg><seg type="columnLine">they started down the steep path toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the salt lick. Men and women dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silver bowls and spilled the scented</seg><seg type="columnLine">water which they had brought to sprinkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sacred animal. The smaller chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren were swung up to their elders' hips</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried off in the rush for safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHITE ELEPHANT</seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg><seg type="columnLine">The trumpeting was closer. Panya was</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the first to seek shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sommerfield caught a thick vine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung from the branches of a great teak</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree and made his way upwards. Boon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right behind him. Halfway up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sommerfield stopped to laugh. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation was in a way ridiculous. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had many experiences with elephants, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never before been forced to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">to safety twice in the same day. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, it was a pleasant interlude in the dull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotonous routine of jungle life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were well concealed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense foliage when the elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Paa Luang!" gasped Boon. "It is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chow's elephant. If he does not follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people he will kill the white elephant. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has attacked every elephant he has found</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he went on must. We have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">merit. We have no merit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right," said Sommerfield to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "We have no merit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not allowed himself to count too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much on the change in the company's for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunes that would follow the advent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetish, but he had felt a peculiar exulta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion when he had Satisfied himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calf was actually an albino. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should hope be dangled momentarily be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his eyes and then snatched away?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From his high perch Sommerfield saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paa Luang crashing through a clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bamboos. He was one of the largest ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phants Sommerfield had ever seen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a stately beast that would make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful showing in a procession; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tusks which were four feet long, curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">inward, so that they almost touched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tips. They would be in the way of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant working with teak logs, but for</seg><seg type="columnLine">show they were splendid. Long black</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks of oil oozed from the must holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the elephant's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The elephant trumpeted again. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering trumpet was heard. Boon</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched Sommerfield's arm. That trum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pet was not from Bua Kam either. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too far away. The tusker stopped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tracks, cocked his ears, and felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air with his trunk. He trumpeted. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was answered. He bellowed and kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ground with his front foot. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge was again answered, and Som-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merfield could hear a crashing of trees in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the newcomer. Paa Luang with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another growl, charged through the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the white elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boon, your knife," whispered Som-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merfield. "Throw it. Stop him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the tusker passed under the tree, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider drew his heavy j ungle knife from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheath and hurled it at the animal's head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aim was good. About six inches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paa Luang's scalp was opened to the bone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paa Luang ducked his head, hunched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, and backed. As he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward again, Boon hurled a dead limb</seg><seg type="columnLine">which checked him a second time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back, worm!" shouted Boon, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpet from the other side of Bua Kam</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the elephant's attention. He trum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peted and charged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The head and shoulders of Father</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eclipse of the Moon broke through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle around the clearing in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young calf lay. He passed the mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant without seeming to notice her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed on to the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With heads up, trunks curled tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">between their tusks, ears fanned straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from their heads and tails held high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stiff, the two tuskers rushed at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other like two locomotives under full</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam. Their heads dropped low and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came together with a reverberating bang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed that one of them would cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly be stunned by the impact, but both</seg><seg type="columnLine">went at the fight as if nothing has hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. Each animal strained and pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he grunted and roared. Round and</seg><seg type="columnLine">round they went in a circle. Paa Luang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusks were longer, and although he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not get them to the sides of Father</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eclipse of the Moon, he did rake them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth across his chest. Moon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter tusks could not reach Paa Luang</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as they kept head to head. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephants strained with tails high and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashing furiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Phra Buddha Chow!" murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLARK BROCKMAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOWING, grunting and bellowing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two elephants struggled. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first neither seemed to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get an advantage, but Father Eclipse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moon was stockier and could use his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight with greater effect. Gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paa Luang lost ground. With a tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous effort Moon pushed him back a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. At the same time Moon ducked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head and disentangled his tusks which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been straddling the long slender ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his foe. As quick as a cat he twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head to the left and sank his right tusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Paa Luang's tough chest. Before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chow's elephant could take advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own unprotected side, Moon's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back and their tusks were interlocked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that game, Paa Luang did not have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. His tusks curved together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so long that only at an angle could</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do effective damage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again they struggled in a circle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads lowered, straining and grunting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again Moon tried to slip past his oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent's guard to make another thrust, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paa Luang lifted his head suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the short tusks from slipping free.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So suddenly did both elephants move and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so fierce was their attack, that the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender tusks of Paa Luang were broken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two stubs remained, one a foot long, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other over two. The ends were jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sharp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The maneuver had disengaged their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusks. Moon, with his head below Paa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luang's, lunged forward for a deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust, but the short jagged tusk caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him between the eyes and tore the skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his forehead and raked it back be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the ears. The heavy skull had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected his head, and Moon had sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second thrust into the massive chest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Moon drew back for a second lunge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paa Luang backed and dropped his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the defensive. Again they maneuvered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a circle. Bellows of pain mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paa Luang became desperate as he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself being pushed back. He exerted</seg><seg type="columnLine">every ounce of strength in a supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. Moon went back. His hind feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck a decaying log and he faltered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paa Luang was upon him in a flash. Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled to maintain his balance. Paa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luang caught a ragged tusk in his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. He thrust again into Moon's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and was making a third jab as Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained his balance and whipped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind quarters to the left. Paa Luang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged tusk raked Moon's leathery side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a demon Moon tore into Paa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luang's unprotected flank. Once, twice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times, Moon sent his tusks home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellows of pain echoed through the jun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle. Then they were head to head again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusks locked and heads lowered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moon's thick tusks were now between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemy's broken stubs. With a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous effort he forced Paa Luang back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shoved again and suddenly raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. His tusks fitted closely around Paa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luang's neck. Moon seemed to expand</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward. Both elephants' forefeet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the ground. Still Moon was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. Suddenly he twisted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Paa Luang was unbalanced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to his side. He did not move. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck had been broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Father Eclipse of the Moon was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. Time after time he thrust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusks into his prostrate foe, stamped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and knelt on him and stamped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again. He seemed controlled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">demon. He was even more savage than</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bua Kam gave a quiet, coaxing call.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped suddenly and faced her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleary eyed and wild. She approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">him fearlessly. The call was repeated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She slipped her flexible trunk over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound on the fighter's head and seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tickle his ear. Father Eclipse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon, swaying and heaving from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">exertions, looked at her with dull, stupid</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. The quiet coaxing sound was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bua Kam turned back to her calf and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran her trunk over his little body as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressing him.

He too ran his trunk over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little form, but he did not seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">caressing it. It was more as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to decide just what it was. Bua</seg><seg type="columnLine">FREE WOOD</seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kam stepped gently aside as Father</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eclipse of the Moon slipped his reddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusks gently under the calf.

Finally the words "Phra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddha Chow" slipped reverently from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the native's lips.

Nason</seg><seg type="columnLine">A GREAT many houses in the Basque</seg><seg type="columnLine">country of France have been built</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ with what looks like second hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumber. The beams of the ceilings, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supports of the barns and the balconies</seg><seg type="columnLine">that are the feature of every Basque</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmhouse all show signs of having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">used before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the average* observer this would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean nothing except that the Basques</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a thrifty race and had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">built their houses from the wreckage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">former habitations. Once in a great while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, some visitor to the Pays Basque</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovers that these massive beams in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling, these gigantic corner posts, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships' timbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beams of the ceiling are mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stringers, easily recognized by the scars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doweling and notching where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frames were attached. In the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room is usually a strake or a huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two foot square timber that has served</seg><seg type="columnLine">some vessel as keelson. One never sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, those natural wood angles that</seg><seg type="columnLine">are used to support the deck. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained by the fact that at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">these houses were built the shipbuilders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were accustomed to use heavy ledges</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of knees, maintaining--and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps rightly--that these ledges added to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the longitudinal strength of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whence came all this timber?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The writer set himself to find out.

Well, then, after a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of asking, the writer found a Basque</seg><seg type="columnLine">who thought that he, the writer, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">English, and wishing to insult him, said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the beams came from captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">English ships.

Excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the increase. It was late April and</seg><seg type="columnLine">money was coming from every part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. From traders and Eskimos in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">North; from trappers, miners and business</seg><seg type="columnLine">men throughout Alaska to men of poverty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wealth alike who chanced to be spend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their declining years in warmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">climates. To some it merely meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbing a bill off a large roll; to others</seg><seg type="columnLine">it meant a sacrifice. Back of it all was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sporting blood of another day prompting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to take a chance; whispering that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had as good a chance to win as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next fellow. Loudly they might declare</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew they didn't have a chance, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint voice of hope whispered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, maybe you have."</seg><seg type="columnLine">CON WELCH opened up his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of business to find the mailbox</seg><seg type="columnLine">crammed with envelopes.

Just below it a wire had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been strung across the river. On the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the wire was connected to a clock as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as a siren. When the ice moved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripod was carried against the wire. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock registered the exact time and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream of the siren proclaimed the ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg><seg type="columnLine">FRANK RICHARDSON PIERCE</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going. Then the camp went mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last of the entries arrived that day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The contest was now in the lap of Mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Con Welch's safe was closed and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the great day when the winner</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to collect. Robbery? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought never occurred to any one in</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. There hadn't been a theft in</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Escape was too difficult in a land</seg><seg type="columnLine">where all movements of humanity must</seg><seg type="columnLine">of necessity converge at the neck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle--the steamers connecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country with the outside world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No telegraph line reached the camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet, by a curiously circuitous method</seg><seg type="columnLine">the miners learned that the ice was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to break far up the river. White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horse sent word to Vancouver and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vancouver radio station broadcasted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news. A local set picked it up. The camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. A day or two; perhaps only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of hours, and the question would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A low boom startled Con Welch. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes and listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There goes the ice!" he cried, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed to the window. The tripod had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not moved. He rubbed his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. "Must have been dreaming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That sure sounded like ice breaking!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to the warmth of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets and dozed off. At six o'clock his</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone rang. A voice came crisply</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the wire:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Con, this is Kenmore speaking. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">much money did you have in that safe?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Roughly, twenty-five thousand dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars. Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's been blown. Get down here as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick as you can!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MOB had surrounded his store when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Con Welch arrived. Each man</seg><seg type="columnLine">*• had made his guess on when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice would go out. Each felt himself rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed of twenty-five thousand dollars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men buzzed like hornets and they were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly aroused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got a dozen men circling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp," Kenmore, the marshal, explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If they've taken a trail out of camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll catch them! Your place ain't so</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly wrecked as it looks. The job was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done by men who know how to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder, but don't know much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">safes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Con nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Half the men in camp can use pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as they talked a deputy hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've found a trail. It ain't much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they went out over the ice. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least two of 'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty men were standing about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for the trail and spoiling for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to take part, backed by authority.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kenmore picked his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll travel light," he announced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and have others follow us up with grub.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're taking to the ice before she goes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They fairly raced down the frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. A half hour gained now was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to several hours hard work once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later they caught the scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a siren behind them. It was a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that never ceased to thrill them. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistles in camp took it up and with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the ringing of bells and the crack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols and rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder who won," a deputy won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't make any difference," Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more replied, "if we don't overhaul the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something cracked ahead of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They ran swiftly and leaped an opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ice. Water began to pour through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading slowly over the smooth surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be a tough job, returning. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later they reached Boulder Creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kenmore threw up his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned. "They knew what they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing. Timed things just right. We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to quit the ice!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a bend in the river," one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them shouted. "If we cut across it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">save something!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lead off!" the marshal ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar grew louder. First the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosive sound of breaking ice, then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinding of millions of ice cakes as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ICE GOES OUT</seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood waters lifted the ice bodily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it toward the sea. Here it strand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed on bars and piled cake on cake until a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam had been formed. There it broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the banks and relieved for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of pressure, while the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flooded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crossed the bend in the river and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of the smooth surface they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired, a churning, ice dotted flood filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course to the banks. They ran madly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking turns at trail breaking; helping</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another over the bad places. Min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes counted. It was a tossup whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could cross the flat country ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the water flooded it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They cut across to the stream once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and followed along the bank. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river had broken through a low moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain range after ages of effort. Walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of granite, scraped by the ice of thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years. A panting deputy cried out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at that!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">ICE HAD choked the gorge and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river was climbing the sheer walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in the midst, leaping from cake to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cake, were two figures. They seemed tiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when compared with the vastness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakup. They moved with desperation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling, fighting, each for himself, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">working toward the jam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One man looked up and saw the posse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a greater danger confronted him. Ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">cakes were being sucked into a vortex that</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured through an opening in the jam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He judged his situation carefully, leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the right moment and was on the jam</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper. He did not look back at his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion, but climbed upwards, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if he gained the top and the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice beyond, the posse had no chance;</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing too, that if he failed, the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">would demand its toll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No word passed among the posse as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched. They knew the ice, these men;</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the might of the river was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerting tremendous pressure to overturn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jam; knew that in the end the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">would succeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men gained the top; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was halfway up. For an instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading man was outlined sharply. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand in defiance and far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath a cake of ice weighing tons groaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in agony, then burst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man in the posse cried out at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama. The river had won. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">jam was moving. Cakes and blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted and the tiny figure of a man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled into the stream an instant before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jam overturned. Another dot, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of arms and legs, fighting a river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained on top of the shifting ice a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, clawed for a niche on the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then fell back. The river, with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden of ice moved on toward the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The youngest member of the posse</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood where the jam had once held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood waters of an empire in check.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you suppose . . . ?" he ventured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," the marshal answered, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a spruce log three feet through at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt. It was a sound timber from heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bark but it was now a pulpy mass being</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed by the ice. "The only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that'll ever be found, son, is the gold nug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets. And maybe the river will keep even</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The rest will be destroyed. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys, let's go back and report. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body's out twenty-five thousand dollars."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagerness to learn who won the pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurred them on, long after muscles cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">for relief. Near camp, a supply party met</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got the crooks?" one of them in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired, slipping a pack from his broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. They've gone down with the ice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Say, who won this year?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kind of an empty victory," the packer</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain grimaced bitterly about his well</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewed pipe shank.

"You're a fine old pirate to be belly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching about hard bargains, you are!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The glint of some ancient enmity, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps more recent grudge, flicked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, cold eye.

'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"XT'S NOT for myself I need this</seg><seg type="columnLine">?■; maintops'l haul," the shipmaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked slowly, confidentially.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's some one else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is, eh?

And Mellish nodded vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. "I love that lad, I do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain's small blue eyes widened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That old Jason Mellish had ever loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody but himself, or could love, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">news for Bohannon.

You always did go in for penny</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezin'," Bohannon affirmed, sucking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his pipe. "I won't drill on that part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, though. Question is, how is she</seg><seg type="columnLine">now? Must be pretty rotten. By God-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frey diamonds, yes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty ripe, I'll admit. A trifle un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaworthy," the ship owner answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A trifle hogged, as I've said. Framing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is weak. But she looks fairly good. Last</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey, a fitter I,knew put the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">across and didn't look too close. Masts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rigging a bit weathered, but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But she'll make the Horn, at least?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. She's not so bad it'd raise any</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicions trying to send her round old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cape Stiff, to Valparaiso." All the keen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzard greed and craftiness had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jason's baggy features as he sat there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dimming light that filtered through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one window obscured by dust and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobwebs. He drummed with knuckly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers on the litter of his desk. "I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get her clearance papers and fix up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance right enough. Get a cargo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, of sorts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mmmm! She's always been a jinker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. Ain't she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, not so good, for luck. That's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dog luck is what she's had!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain asserted. "Chronical black luck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always leakin', goin' ashore, killin' men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She's been loaded to the hatches with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoodoo, and no mistake. I reckon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one proud of her is the devil--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Same thing. Mind how she killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man, young feller named Humason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a blow off Hatteras? Winter of ninety-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight or nine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I was saying," the ship owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored the reminiscence, "there won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be any question--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was a hard case," Bohannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued. "He got killed on the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">foretops'l yard, as I recollect it. Chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of the lower tops'l thrashed round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looped itself over him, tore the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly out o' him, innards and all. Ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates got him down from aloft, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to glory in five minutes. Just been</seg><seg type="columnLine">married, too, afore sailing. A damn' bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">take. Enough to jink any ship and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hard to sign a crew!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you worry about a crew," Jason</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him, a bit grimly. "I'll get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, all right, if you'll go captain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've said I would, ain't I?

How in</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazes we ever scraped up a bunch o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">sodjers like this gets me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Same here," Mayes agreed. He spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal of tobacco juice over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lee rail, now--as the sails were drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">well--inclined toward the gray, smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas boiling past; then, after a pause,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That feller in the focsle, him the Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man had brung aboard last night, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">barreled up, sure, I wonder if he'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">any good?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like .he could hand, reef and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steer," Leadspitter opined.

A grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, fine grown young feller and a blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">water man, or I'm no judge. Soon as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets on an even keel we'll turn him to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon see, by Judas Priest!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hope he comes out o' his square</seg><seg type="columnLine">bender afore long," the Irishman re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced aloft at the swelling belly of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintopsail. "Well, we'll preach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boot and belayin' pin gospel to 'em, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.

Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, here goes to choose watches, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' A sweet, proper job it'll be, at that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jumpin' Jupiter, yes, sir!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMETHING more than an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, with the China Girl heeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">well over on a south southeast</seg><seg type="columnLine">course and with the rain abatecj to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrant drizzle, the young husky of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their discussion dragged himself out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk on the starboard side of the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">deckhouse, which served as a forecastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few minutes he sat on the bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, elbows on knees and head between</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, in the dazed anguish of the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that throbbed his temples. Vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cold light through the deckhouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports showed him as a rather heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered man in patched dungarees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worn down jackboots. It revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crisp set, chestnut hair, tousled all</seg><seg type="columnLine">awry, and--on the crown--blood stiff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. But of his face, hidden by well</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded hands, nothing was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some few dim figures lolling in bunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">or on the wooden benches at either side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table cast hardly a glance at the suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferer. Incurious in their misery, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him to his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the man perceived the slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll of the ship, the slithering whisper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. Mustering at least enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength to look about him, he blinked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bloodshot eyes, saw his mates, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty canvas dunnage bags, a sea chest or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, dingily battered. His forehead knit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in webs of puzzlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ship's this?" he demanded in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry, hoarse voice barely louder than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper. "What's her name and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No one answered. One of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">there present was a St. Pierre-Miquelon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman who had scant English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One, a Swede who had little more; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third, the Russian Finn, constitutionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. Then there was a weasel faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cockney, sucking at a limp cigaret; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">near him a stolid, beaky nosed old Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, his cropped hair gray as a badger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands blue with tattooing, chin fringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a stubble of white beard. A lump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish, cross eyed negro blent with the deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of the forecastle. Only one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all this flotsam appeared to take heed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sufferer; and this one was perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unprepossessing of all--an East</seg><seg type="columnLine">Side gangster and gunman, now nursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruises recently acquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This gangster had found it prudent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a Chatham Square battle, to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ROARING HORN</seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg><seg type="columnLine">not upon the order of his going but to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. Fate had led him to Stapleton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The China Girl had offered a haven of</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge. He had made shift to stow away</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard of her; but so clumsily that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly half an hour after the watches had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been chosen, Leadspitter had discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Hence these bruises on "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodger", as was his elegant title in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ship and where bound?" re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated the man with the bloodied poll.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still no reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, are you all deaf and dumb?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Frenchman shrugged indifferent</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders under his striped "gansey".</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Finn lighted a pipe of willow wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingeniously carved, yawned with yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs and fell a-smoking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A fine bunch of swabs you are!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufferer gibed, sweeping them all and</seg><seg type="columnLine">severally with his contempt. "If I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">you aboard o' my own ship, I'd soon have</seg><seg type="columnLine">something out o' you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, don't get shirty!" the Cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted. "Gorblimey, it's only another</seg><seg type="columnLine">billet in sail, an' wot odds Vhere to? Too</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to be funkin' it, mytey. We all got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stick it now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shanghaied man blinked stupidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Londoner,* half seeing a pale face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with reddened eyelids and with a sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">com colored wisp of mustache. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived a water bucket on the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes brightened. Water! Ah!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got up unsteadily, staggered a bit--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he had not yet got the feel of the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slant of the deck--and seizing a tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup drank deep gurgling draughts. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank still again, with the greedy thirst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Ot coppers, eh?" laughed the Cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney. "You eyn't the only one. Perish</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pinkies, no! Well, drink 'earty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though we'll all need more than water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'fore we're through with this.

That's all I got to say!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What?" demanded the shanghaied</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. "Horn? Round the Horn? No!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Impossible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fact, mytey! An' you can't 'op it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, so it eyn't no use to grouse abaht</seg><seg type="columnLine">it an' that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My great God!" gulped the man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the port door. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horn! No!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE BREATH sawed between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">parched lips as he jerked the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, admitting a gust of raw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp air to the stifling fetor of the deck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, you!" snarled the gangster, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a garnishment of oaths. "Shut that door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you poor boob!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man turned, with hard knuckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out I don't shut you!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">menaced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gunman's eye gleamed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows, but he ventured no retort. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the shanghaied man narrowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured him with a look that, for all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflamed pain, held steady; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped out of the house and banged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damned cattle!" he spat. "If I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em on mine, I'd clew and cat 'em quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough!"	p</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reviving a bit under the stimulus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fresh, salt edged breeze, he made way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the high bulwark just abaft the break</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forecastle head, and stood a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking off to leeward. Little enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">information he got there. Boiling tangles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of foam, gray rolling surges sullenly fad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into mists, told him nothing save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">--though how he had come there, not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all did he know--he was already far at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Only the immense and primal soli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes of the regardless ocean met his gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The joke's on me, all right," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. "If I was a booze fighter I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand it. But--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised a hand to his head. A spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial focus of pain there, and the feel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clotted bibod, wakened nebulous mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Batted me, by gad!" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ah, now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vaguely as through these same mists</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouding the Atlantic, some colorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg><seg type="columnLine">GEORGE ALLAN ENGLAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline took form, of what must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. He recalled having left his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own ship, the steamer Lyndon Castle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying at Pier 89, East River. That had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been at night; but what night, how long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, he could not tell. Somewhere at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his mind, uncertain memories</seg><seg type="columnLine">wove. He seemed to have approached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">subway station, with purpose to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">uptown to a movie. Then--but though</seg><seg type="columnLine">film flickers palely irradiated the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">places of his mind, nothing grew coherent</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rubbed his wounded head, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Batted me!" he growled. "Took me</seg><seg type="columnLine">abaft, all right. And maybe dosed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with knockout drops into the bargain. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't so much mind being capsized in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair fight, but this! Well, by the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">typhoon, somebody's going to pay for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, that's sure!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">STILL unsteady on his legs--hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscled through the dirty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged dungarees that now encased</seg><seg type="columnLine">them instead of the trim blue he last re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called having worn--he made his way aft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His gait, for all its weakness, revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as a sailor. Only a sailor meets the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep sea roll und*er his boots as he met it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He passed the galley, the sailmaker's and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boatswain's quarters and the carpenter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop, all in the forward house on which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat lay bottom up. Purposeful was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one gave him any heed. Two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three raynicks were sweeping, clumsily</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiling braces. A couple of the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced, with greenhorns to help them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be cursed, were busy lashing spare</seg><seg type="columnLine">spars that lay along the deck. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should any notice him? Dirt and misery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were they not too common aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">China Girl to excite even a passing glance?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the walk and set up of a true deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterman, hesteadfastlykepton. Instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively he cast an eye aloft. He saw a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">men--the best, these--placing crows'</seg><seg type="columnLine">nests or pudding bags on the mainstay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forestays and crosstree horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Getting the bagwrinkle on her, he?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he, and knew it prophesied a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship, he sensed, was dingy and ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, with slovenly Irish pennants</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering from her gear aloft, and Geordie</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches spotting her canvas. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly shipshape and Bristol fashion here!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, outraged and suffering though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, still something stirred within him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some recognition of the beauty of mast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sail that not even time's decay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neglect of man had quite been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliterate. Loftily sparred, built on</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful models of old days, the ship still</seg><seg type="columnLine">met her ancient comrades, wind and sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with something of her one time joyance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shanghaied man breathed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">more deeply as with rucked up hair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoldering eyes he trod the scarred, foul</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. He passed the main hatch, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of the main fiferail, and still pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded aft. There, all at once, a harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice hailed him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, you! Where the devil you</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man stopped short, peered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath contracting brows. He saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, red headed, lumbering figure with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarred cheek, advancing upon him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weather side of the big iron watertank</seg><seg type="columnLine">just abaft the after hatch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heave to, there! Where you goin'?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Going?" the shanghaied man re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated the word. "Going aft, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What for?" was Leadspitter's sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mary question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want a word with the captain, sir."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, you do, do you? Well, this ain't no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for questions. Get along forrard!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eyes of the shanghaied man com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced to glower in his head. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment silence fell, silence save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thudding swish of waters along the hull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muffled plaints of the old ship's creak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the seaway. Into that silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked seven metallic clangs struck by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wry leg Newfoundlander at the wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by seven from the bell stand at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the break of the forecastle head--seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells of the afternoon watch. Leadspitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get along forrard, I tell you! This</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ROARING HORN</seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't no private yachtin' cruise, by Judas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest!

Leadspitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You want to see me, eh?" the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded round his pipestem. His pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes evinced something of the qual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity of a cat with a cornered mouse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, what say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about? About your ratin' as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer? Oh, I heard what you said!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bohannon's hard slitted eyes revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold fires.

From the seams of her holy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoned decks stewed and bubbled pitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that smeared the soles, now mostly naked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all who trod them. A sickly stench of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilges arose from the forepeak. Cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaches had begun to swarm; and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats, driven up from below by the intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, had commenced venturing furtively</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck. This, despite the ravages of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slit eared and filthy cat which Humphrey</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chubbock the Newfoundland cook had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetched aboard in New York, and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">now snarled and spat at all with a veno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous temper almost equal to the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the galley, while Bohannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched and listened, a clink of tinware</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coppers sounded as Chubbock messed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with grub few wanted on the sweltering</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Chubbock had to labor under diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culties, what of weevily biscuit, salt beef</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hard that the foremast hands had nick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">named it sole leather, tea flavored with</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaches, rotting potatoes and other skulch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Chubbock worked he was singing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. The irregular gusts of noise that</seg><seg type="columnLine">served him as music suddenly fell silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stoked his range. Into that silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued a sailorman, out of the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">deckhouse. His tough skin, powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, manner of glancing aloft, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked him as a seasoned lobscouscr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The vigorous modeling of his head, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter and steady gazing dark eyes, strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard and rich tanned sunburn made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arresting figure as, open throated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with muscular bare arms he stood gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the tropic sea, searching for any sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In "dog's wool and oakum" singlet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dungaree trousers, with naked feet thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg><seg type="columnLine">GEORGE ALLAN ENGLAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">into pitch smeared shoes, there he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked about him, yearning for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">capful of wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell of a situation, this is!" Tyson</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented his thought. "Becalmed on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">old wagon, when every hour's one hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">more I don't get even up with Bohannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his pretty pair of bucko mates!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he relapsed into a smoldering</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, turned aft and made way toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the galley. Somewhat bruised about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck though he was, and with a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish purple patch reminiscent of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extensive black eye, Roderick Tyson still</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a fine figure of a man. He breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely and looked steadily. Though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was held captive, the heart in him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scathless. Gait and bearing showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the shuffle or cringe that some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other poor wretches manifested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight, enough and plenty, still remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Tyson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE galley door Tyson paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">h\ and with something like a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened to Chubbock's song--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mournful ditty about shipwreck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern Seas and girls that were left be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you know about girls, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">tindercrack?" .demanded Tyson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Roddy!" exclaimed the New-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundlander.

On his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand he had only a thumb and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger, which he used nipper fashion like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crab. "Ever since dem dere Garden of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eden days, if you can find anythin' as</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands cl'ar of gals' tarmentin', it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quare thing.

"That there</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke looks to me like it meant trouble."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir," agreed the mate. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't no steamer.

Hatchet faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">An toon--he had been a taxi driver ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and Cultan the "rock scorpion", once a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumboat -man at Gibraltar, lounged</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the rail, together with Broadfoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the negro, Gorley the Cockney, the Finn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paavola, and Jubal Tabry, he of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gammy leg. Tyson watched, too; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the carpenter shop looked out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mild, huge mustached face of Chips •</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solomon Moon. Like Chubbock, Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Newfoundlander.

With sun dazzled eyes they</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked at the drift of dun vapor that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smearing the southwest horizon, gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">hints of some sea tragedy there. Voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ship afire, wot? Wish to Gawd 'twas</seg><seg type="columnLine">this blinkin' one!

Not even wetted</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers, held on high, could find a hint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze. Restive, grumbling, the crew put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a weary time. Bohannon, between</seg><seg type="columnLine">nipping rum and cursing, made himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">venomously ugly. A few flying fish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flittering aboard, were welcomed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat--the only man aboard permitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk the poop on the weather side with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain. Lying out on the martin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gale, Saunier the Miquelon "Frenchy"</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported a pilot fish, believed by sailors</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a sure sign of a shark hanging about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. This caused uneasy bodings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a death on board, among some few.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indolently the off watch men yarned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked, talked of wreck and peril,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched an occasional filmy purple Portu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guese man o' war trailing its poisonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">filaments through the clear brine. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">advent of a school of porpoises, leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">with swiftly graceful joy, aroused fugitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest. Frenchy, having sighted some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonita, came inboard for a harpoon and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coil of heaving line from the boatswain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">locker. He succeeded in striking a fairish</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimen. But when the meat was tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">(as usual with bonita) by putting a silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">coin into it, the silver turned black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherefore the fish had to be flung over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, and curses followed it. Had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonita been good, it would have made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome addition to the ship's wretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucker.

A wraith</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the star flecked night, Paavola the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout man lounged on the forecastle</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The spectral, pale eyed face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karlstad, the Swede, half illumined by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the binnacle's sullen glimmer, hung at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheelhouse window.

From the carpenter shop, around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of which lounged a few hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their watch below, issued jerky and stri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent chords from a consumptive accordion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noah Landerry, the P.

Lanternlight played uncertainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his gaunt features as he whinneyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that lusty old favorite:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "In Amsterdam there lives a maid,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Mark well what I do say!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    In Amsterdam there lives a maid,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     An' she's the mistress of her trade!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "A-rovin', a-rovin', since rovin's been my ruin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     I'll go no more a-rovin', with yon, fair maid!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Atta boy!" one approved.

His ominous bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounged, a shadow among darker shadows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the weather poop. Leadspitter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hating all hands aboard that night; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">most especially was he hating Tyson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The muscular and bare armed shanghaied</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, brown and bearded and unafraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, filled him with poisonous antipathies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's int'rest, runnin' up on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of a one, all the time," Leadspitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully reflected, as he spat overside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To him it was almost a personal affront</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Tyson was turning out so well, doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his duty like a proper seaman, offering no</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion for assault and battery. This,</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly, was something of a grievance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that laddibuck 'd only say some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin' or do somethin', I'd soon preach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belayin' pin to him, s'help my God!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter cogitated.

The mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt inimical to all superiority, felt dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenanced and put down by any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his betters. And that Tyson was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidedly one of his betters, not even he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could deny. Marlinespike seamanship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about the limit of Leadspitter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability. But rumors had reached him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well he knew that Tyson was possessed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious mathematical heights whereof</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter knew not even the names.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The best that Leadspitter could do, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">folding latitude, was to use the old, sloven</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of working with the constant of 89°</seg><seg type="columnLine">48'. Sometimes, as he well knew, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoning might put a ship six or eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles out; and that, on a lee shore in hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather, might be an infernally serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. "Good enough for a collier," as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old phrase has it, is not good enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a skysail yarder going round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got no master's papers," Leadspitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullenly reflected. "Never can have, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">along o' these here damn' fool mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics!" And than again, "I'll learn him</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematics if ever he falls foul o' me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll learn him 'stronomy. He'll be writin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">books about the stars, after he sees all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em I got packed in my fist!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus did Tyson's superior knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">engender viperish hate in the mind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter. Thus did the mate dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vengeance, there on the China Girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which herself seemed a ship o' dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a dreaming sea. And somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">off there to westward in the night, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silent, wondering stars, still lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery of what that day had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward two bells of the middle watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">a timid breath of air stirred the ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently began to breeze on a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">from north northeast, soon hauling more</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the eastward. The idle canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellied into a white cloud aspiring toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. As the sails filled and drew, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">China Girl commenced shoving her cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water through tiny spats of waves now</seg><seg type="columnLine">building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the ship's forefoot waters began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to curl white; and astern, flecks of evasive</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescence gleamed, winked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded, as if the Milky Way itself had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken to a froth of stars. One hour, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a moderate breeze the old wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammer was on her course again, on into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South that waited to destroy her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">GENTLY reaching along before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">•	fair, following breeze, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">China Girl was logging three knots</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four. The smoke of breakfast a-making</seg><seg type="columnLine">wafted from Charley Noble. Coppers</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanked; the scent of even cockroach and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicory coffee gladdened the hearts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aloft, serving the main topgallant stay--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten and perished like much of the gear</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Roderick Tyson looked abroad upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea of splendors. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite all this toil, humiliation, abuse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">life still was good. His eye caught some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, a speck, a far and tiny atom on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean off to southwest. At this he</seg><seg type="columnLine">squinted a moment, then called down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter Mayes on the quarter deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Small boat ahoy, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" demanded the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate. "Boat, you say?'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the starboard bow, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mayes scrutinized the sea, but from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lower position could sight nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went below for a glass. This brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drifting object into his range of vision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter came up, too, a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, and took a long look as the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually forged nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a boat, right enough," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">affirmed, surly as if the presence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat constituted a direct affront to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">majesty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, that must be off the ship we</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen burnin' yesterday," judged Mayes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Anybody aboard her, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like.

"Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that whiskered whelp o' misery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyson, reported it. There's plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard here, as'd like nothin' better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to jack us up for it after we made port."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His scarred face contracted to a snarl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We got to run down on her.

Port fore brace!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watch on deck jumped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, Mayes slacking off the weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">braces. So handled, the ship swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">round till the wind was abeam on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">starboard side, with the yards trimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">accordingly. Thus she stood away toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vague speck that, alone upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast heaving breast of old ocean, broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">that immeasurable solitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tensions of interest keyed up all hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the rail dishevelled men leaned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering.

That interest leaped suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">high intensity when a few minutes later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter took another sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In amazement the mate exclaimed:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hell's hinges, what d'you think, now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If my eyes ain't gone plumb bad--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is it, sir?" interrogated Mayes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You said 'twas a man, eh?

Then they fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the medicine chest affixed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulkhead, the chest containing no incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable supply of his choicest stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lants. The sight of that chest caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to smile slightly.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want no woman aboard o' this one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more 'n we want the itch!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so much, sir," Leadspitter agreed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but there 'tis, sir, an' can't be no tizzer!</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' I know lots about itchin', too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll damn' soon see about this!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain affirmed, with a brimstone volley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And up on deck he mounted forthwith to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see about it, indeed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CHINA GIRL was by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time within half a mile of the boat;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even to the naked eye the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">was growing apparent that the boat car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried a woman. Leadspitter's binoculars</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered another form there, probably a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, lying inert and motionless in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern sheets under the pitiless cooking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman sat beside him, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">now no signals; for rescue was at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With keen and growing tensions of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est--for the most part heavy with fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodings of evil fortune that impended--</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers and crew watched while their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship bore down on the boat. Bohannon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow, above all, was clouded with dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure at this embroilment. What effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">might it now have upon his plans, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherished and delightful plans, which just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes before he had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">savoring on the tongue of anticipation?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there the boat lay, drifting; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever impended, pick her up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain must. His face was a chart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grim ugliness as, when the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ranged within a quarter mile, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back the main tops'l!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The main yard was thrown aback and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship brought close to the wind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly losing way, she lay in irons, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Get the port dingey over!" com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Bohannon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watch jumped to the boat--little</seg><seg type="columnLine">urging they needed now--cast the lash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings adrift, hove up the davit falls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung the boat out. When the dingey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lowered, Leadspitter took a crew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">four of his best seamen, carefully over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking Tyson, and gave way handsomely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like something of a nabob the mate sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stern sheets; almost an atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heroism enveloped him, of rescue for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distressed, knight errantry for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afflicted. Leadspitter looked quite puffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and proud, in his role, as the dingey</seg><seg type="columnLine">foamed buoyantly over the chrome</seg><seg type="columnLine">green swells splashed with gorgeous sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes he was alongside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting boat, had made her painter fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was returning with her in tow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">very copper of excitement lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongues of the watchers, aboard, as Lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spitter drew up amidships on the star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board side, where the Jacob's ladder had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been put down. A strikingly different</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of boat the castaway was, from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere ship's dingey. Handsomely metaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and varnished and built of fine hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods, she showed the emblem of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht club on her bow. A small pennant</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the initial "V" also depended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a staff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bloomin' yacht's boat!" commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cockney. "Millionaire stuff, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, perish my pinkies if it eyn't!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Chee,if dem's millionaires into it," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunman judged, "dey're damn' hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookin' millionaires!

"You</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned jackal!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ROARING HORN</seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg><seg type="columnLine">SILENCE fell, save for the orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to get the castaways</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard and the boats hoisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those at the rail could see that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescued man, although still breathing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was frightfully burned. Heavily ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">daged though he was, the terrible severity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his injuries was apparent. Strips that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have been torn from a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck skirt swathed his head and arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A grizzle of grayish beard that jutted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the head bandages proved him an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldish man; and the quality of his charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit of blue showed he was no ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor. Inert, this man lay in the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wid just about enough life left in 'un</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breathe on," as Solomon Moon said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Proper bet out an' burned black as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny, he is, so!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aspect of the woman--the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather--now also lying insensible on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom cleats near the man, confirmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opinion that these were people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth. More clearly than any one else,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyson, leaning over the rail abreast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main hatch, perceived that here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman of no common clay. Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, when captain of his own ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyson had come in contact with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. A personable and seemly young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman this was, despite the terror and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardships she had suffered. Tyson's iner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant, divinatory glance told him here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the daughters of the House of Have.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noted her blue serge skirt and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">middy blouse of fine white linen, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly smudged with dirt and ashes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt water; observed a ring wherein a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent pigeon's blood ruby glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sunlight. But more especially he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the opulent mass of lustrous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue black hair that, all loosened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disheveled, spread thickly on the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleats of the boat. As for the girl's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that remained invisible. Lying as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, it was turned from him, hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bandaged right arm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious, grizzle bearded man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tyson had, however, scant time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation. Work was to be done, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">100K alive there!" commanded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter. "Rig a whip and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bring 'em up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karlstad attached a small block to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">topmast backstay, and through it rove a</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. A bowline was lowered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht's boat, and the inanimate forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hoisted on dcck by a dozen willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The boats dropped back from amid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships to the quarter where the davit falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dingey were hanging loose. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yacht's boat was hooked on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought inboard, to be placed amidships</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the poop deck; then the davit falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were overhauled to hoist the dingey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The captain's interest centered in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">castaways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Bring 'em to the break o' the poop</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let's have a look at 'em, Mr. Fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long!" commanded Bohannon from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starboard ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tyson was not among those who car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried the rescued aft. Since Bohannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had knocked him over the poop rail, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">place had been to him repellent. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when standing trick at the wheel, or at</seg><seg type="columnLine">other orders, had he even approached it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now leaning against the carpenter shop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched the scene in contemplative</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. Strange scene, under the slash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sunshine of those tropic waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vile was Bohannon's humor, viler even</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Leadspitter's, as they inspected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">castaways. Delays and complications</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequent to life saving lay far outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain's purview. Worse, a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced factors of the most vexatious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The berthing and accommodation of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, aboard that old windjammer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might mean God alone knew what trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worst of all, Bohannon previsioned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of a woman might impose</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain restrictions of speech and action</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him; and Bohannon was no man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome any restraints whatever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We got to take 'em in, though, God</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffen 'em!" he exclaimed after a pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liminary view. "Into the cabin with 'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four sailors, under supervision of Abey</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buzzard, the wry necked old steward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried them through the starboard door</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg><seg type="columnLine">GEORGE ALLAN ENGLAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the main cabin, where they laid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the table, the girl on the lounge</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the port side. For. the moment, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bohannon's thought was directed to get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting once more under way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fill your main tops'l again, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Furlong," he commanded. "Let her fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">off on her course!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," Leadspitter answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But between you an' me an' the capstan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir--" and he showed his crooked teeth--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we're into quite a rookus with these here</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers.

Look alive, or I'll learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">you how!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">BOHANNON, turning to inspect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, saw the suitcase lying in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern sheets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, what the devil's this?" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lifted it out. Through all the fume of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his displeasure, there was that which now</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed speculatively in his pale blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. That eye diminished to a point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder. "They got away with some o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dunnage, all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That there's a jim-dandy of a piece o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage, Cap'n," judged Leadspitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's the genuine cowhide. Liable to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some good stuff inside, there, one kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. An' look at them letters on it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you, sir? Gold letters, s'help my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cod!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I. L. R.," read Bohannon. "Mmmm!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tony folks, eh, what? "More hell!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll be wantin' us to put in some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheres and set 'em ashore!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pondered a silent moment. Frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary thoughts crossed his tortuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. Might this not after all jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his plans? His spade ended fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched his cranium as he tried to stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late thought. How colorable an excuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">might this not give him for making port</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere--port, where he himself could</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit the doomed ship! Not too bad, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion. And moreover, rich folk like</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, what might they not pay for such</seg><seg type="columnLine">service? Far from bad! Matters might,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, be in excellent train for Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bohannon!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For all that, though, the captain still</seg><seg type="columnLine">let his anger burn. Anger was to Bohan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non a luxury he never missed freely</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulging. But Abey Buzzard inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted his thoughts by coming on deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to report:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We got 'em stowed, sir. Any time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wants to put 'em to a survey, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, stewart, take this bag below,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain ordered. "I'll go down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what's what. I'll send Mr. Mayes</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to take charge." This, to Leadspitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then you come below, yourself. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a few matters to decide on now!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">ATTERS, indeed. Problems of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most urgent!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man stretched out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin table, they saw without need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than half an eye. was already dying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns such as he had received could end</seg><seg type="columnLine">in only one way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This old cuss is nigh hand to hove</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on his beam ends." Leadspitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented. "He's took some jeroosly</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful damage, sir!" As Abey loosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bandages, with sundry jerks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quavers of his head, the steward being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous man, the three saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's race was run. "He's all-fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh dead, sir, that's sure as shootin'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look a' them arms an' that face. Burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a crisp!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and his chist, too," the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, scrutinizing the man under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam through the skylight. "Looks 's</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he'd been spattered with burnin' oil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or somethin' like. Gas, mebbe. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ROARING HORN</seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg><seg type="columnLine">more 'n likely breathed fire, too. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's a doubt if he'll stand it till night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly. Burned black as zip!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir, an' old too, goin' up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy years or the like o' that. Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck is what he is, I hope to tell you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	wouldn't give a tinker's dam for his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, that's one of 'em we'll get clear of,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow. There ain't nothin' we can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothin' is right," Bohannon agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You and the stewart take him in one o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spare cabins.

Shock, exhaustion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst accounted for her prostration. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templatively they studied her, devoid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity but with keen calculation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's had one cold smack, all right,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted Leadspitter. "But she ain't hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">none. She'll soon come to rights, on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">even keel. Whoever she is, devil take</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but she's one good looker!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You take a reef or two and bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">away!" the captain meaningly warned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stow that kind o' talk. Whatever this</seg><seg type="columnLine">here ship is, you bet your jib halyards</seg><seg type="columnLine">there won't be no funny business. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey business like that, mind you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're carryin' a good full o' trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now, without no petticoat mixups.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What I'd like to know is who the hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">she is, where from and where bound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Likewise, if it comes to that, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much it's worth to me, rescuin' her at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only way to bottom that out, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckon, is to bring her to. A little stain</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' rum might fix her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stewart," Bohannon ordered, "a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket o' water and a tot o' rum!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir!" And Abey Buzzard fetched</seg><seg type="columnLine">both. "Will I fix her up? I'm a married</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, sir. I knows all about women."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you do, you old gumphead," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain retorted, "you know more 'n any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man livin'. But heave ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. You're old enough so it's safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY watched while Abey Buzzard</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly swabbed her hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">face with water, then forced rum</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her mouth, slopping more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of it over her full rounded throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watched, while she stirred there on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounge, groaned, opened dark eyes dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pain and wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're all right, miss," the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbled in a tone he meant to be ingra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiating, soothing. "You're gettin' all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine and shipshape again. You're safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard now--safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, shuddering, tried to struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">up; but Bohannon pushed her back again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his huge and anchor tattooed paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, miss, you lay down and keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet!" he commanded. "You've had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough and rugged. Been took a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">abaft, and keeled over. You're dll spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">out now. But you'll soon be A-l, slick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mole. Lay still, now. That's the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father!" she exclaimed in a weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice fining down to a whisper. "Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right in that there cabin, miss."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he jerked an unseemly thumb at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin door. "We got your dunnage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all righto." He picked up the suitcase</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set it on the table. "Here she is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">see? Your father, he's comf'table as</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be expected. Now, go to sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get a little kink and you'll be fine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to see my father!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you can't see your father--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">just yet!" the captain asserted with con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable vehemence. "We're lookin' out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your father!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he--dead?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, he ain't. There now, you lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment, with large and fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened eyes, she peered up at Bohannon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter and old Abey Buzzard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimly she perceived the cradling roll of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, heard the creak and give of</seg><seg type="columnLine">timbers that constituted the old vessel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to the sea. But, very clearly, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg><seg type="columnLine">GEORGE ALLAN ENGLAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not fully recovered her understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Life still swam before her, mistily</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscured, as if dimming veils of haze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you say he's all right--" she fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, and they saw her eyes were deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue than any sea; so blue, so deep, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">verged almost on black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't I said so, a'ready?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain. "Think I'm lyin', eh, what?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm truthful, miss; 7 am!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl tried to say a few words, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell away to silence without making herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligible. Drawing in a deep breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she sank to oblivions of exhaustion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave her be, sir; beggin' your par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don," ventured old Abey. "I knows all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about women. She'll be fine arfter a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," answered Bohannon. "Carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in that spare cabin next her old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fix her up comf'table.

The captain remained staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the suitcase, fascinated by its luxurious</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather, the gold stamped initials, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities it might enclose. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter emerged from the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">whither they had carried the girl. Bohan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non silently beckoned him, gestured</seg><seg type="columnLine">eloquently at the suitcase. Leadspitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then the captain saw Abey Buz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zard peering out at him with an odd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will I bring her baggage in to her, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir?" the steward asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!

And remember one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stewart!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothin' as happens here goes out o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, savvy?

I'm the best tightener</seg><seg type="columnLine">of loose mouths as ever trod a ratline!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--yes, sir!" Abey vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bohannon picked up the suitcase and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded his head toward the door of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own room. Leadspitter followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">thither. Once inside, with the catch on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door shot home, Bohannon laid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitcase on his desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now then, Mr. Furlong," he bit out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"now then, let's see what's what."</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">TREASURE AND DEATH</seg><seg type="columnLine">"TT THAT'S what?" echoed Lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">%/%/ spitter. His thick fingers shook</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *	* a little as he filled and lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pipe. This thing of investigating rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks' baggage had somewhat sapped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve. "It wouldn't be just the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticket to open that there suitcase, d'you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not, wouldn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sir, I ain't superstitious, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin'.

Best thing we--you--could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, seems like, would be to leave it lay."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I ain't goin' to, nohow!" Bohan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non decided. "And what's more, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">askin' you to heave up 'longside and bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand with me, doin' it.

Or arms and ammynition?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Might be a pistol, eh, what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, that's so," the mate assented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I never thought o' that.

"Only a female</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit out, I reckon. Not much here! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what there is, it's all like an old fireship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">garret, everythin' on top and nothin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His huge and tattooed hand pawed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine small wares and apparel.

"A gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was not, however, a gun. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bohannon dragged out the metal object,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it stood revealed as a japanned dispatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, with J. D.

But all at once--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thunderin' God!" the captain gulped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter reached out, uncertainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the contents of the box, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again.

So then, it's just you an' me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first wine of excitement was dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their veins. Now their pulses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to beat with a more calculant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lost overboard," the captain re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated. "That's what I said. Act o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, stress o' weather, or whatever. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody but us two knows what in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">here box, do they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. How much d'you make it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bohannon dumped the contents of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispatch box on to his desk and spread it</seg><seg type="columnLine">abroad. A little chamois bag caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. This bag had lain beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper money and the bonds, and thus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">till now escaped him. With thick fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that quivered a bit he picked it up. Lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spitter eagerly exclaimed--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cast off them cords there, sir, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With some difficulty Bohannon loos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened the chamois bag. From it he poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a cascade of diamonds, small and</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, of emeralds, rubies, sapphires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even in the half light of the cabin the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious stones winked and shimmered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating pools of liquid light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">OLY murder in Ireland!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leadspitter made odd, grunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing noises, half breathless and blown by</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds of covetousness. He managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">articulate--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How--how much--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lashin's o' money!" Bohannon ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "I ain't strong on estimatin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">joolry, or the like o' that, but I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's many a king's ransom e for less 'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">just these here.

Count it, Cap'n,</seg><seg type="columnLine">count it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bohannon's clumsy fingers shook as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacked up the heavy bundles of bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes--some of them the big white ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Bank of England--and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting. Wolfish eyed, Leadspitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, with suspended breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hundred and five thousand, Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican," the captain announced. "Sixteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand pounds, English. That's, let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, call it eighty thousand bucks. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and eighty-five thousand, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">them jools."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell silent, his eyes like live coals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment Leadspitter could find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. Only the rumor of their heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing and the send of the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the hull disturbed that pregnant</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hundred an'--eighty-five thousand!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulped Leadspitter. Sweating and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">red hair rucked up, he made a singular</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of agitation. "That's--by Judas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest!--that's more 'n ninety thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">apiece for us, an'--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slack away aft!" the captain growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who said anything about even-steven?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ain't you goin' to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like hell!

But the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's brow was heavy with menace. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're liable not to get a cent, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't speak up lively!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, sir," the mate conceded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have it your own way.

"I just wanted to say, sir, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--it's all off with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kicked the bucket, you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir. Thought you'd oughta</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right. Sheer off!" To Leadspitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered, "I hope, by jolly, that old</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool of a stewart ain't noticed we got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitcase in here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He don't notice nothin'," the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly more than whispered. "He don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice not even the sun, don't know he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. I ain't worryin' none about Abey!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already Bohannon was tying up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gems in the buckskin bag, replacing bag,</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, bonds much as they had been, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal box. He closed the box and</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked it, then shoved it back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitcase which he tightly strapped. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he pondered, with another and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new idea pulling him by the ear. Lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spitter watched him keenly; he smeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat from his forehead, heavily beaded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and huskily breathed--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Man Aloft, but it's hot here!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Harkee, Mr. Furlong," the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly spoke. "You and me, we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardners into this here, now, one third</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you and two for me. That's a say so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of us, and stands. But I'm thinkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">this here may not be such a picnic, at that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's all up to you to keep a stopper on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your jaw. If this here, if any breath o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">this money now, was to get forrard--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Among them beggars forrard?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's it. If they was to suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cion it--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean they might start a manus?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mutinize, on us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a good guesser.

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang o' hell benders, they'd tear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts out of us through our teeth, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the stuff; yes, and the livers, too!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you can lay to that, solid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lot they could do!" truculently re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't never tell what they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">do! So you just be careful and double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reef your tongue, savvy? It's a fact we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got all the guns." Bohannon glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship's armament suspended above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But our aft guard is only me and you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter Mayes and old Abey.

But forrard there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen or more as hard cases as ever I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one bunch. What's more, there's one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'em--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean that black livered cod,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tyson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right!

But there ain't no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use takin' long shots. The wind's hangin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a good quarter, for us. Let's keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">it so. There ain't no use takin' chances."</seg><seg type="columnLine">S4</seg><seg type="columnLine">GEORGE ALLAN ENGLAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eloquently he touched his thin and gash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like mouth.

If you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">play square--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That '11 do you! What? Threatenin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">your superior officer? Hell's bells, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's nigh hand to mutiny!" Bohannon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale eyes bored through the mate, gimlet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like. Leadspitter's own fell. "Now then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mum's the word. And here goes to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff back, all proper and honest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE Leadspitter keenly watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he got up and unlocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Taking the suitcase, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung across the slant of the main cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor to the girl's cabin, knocked, got no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, and entered. He set the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">down beside the berth where she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying; then for a moment he stood watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her with evil and prehensive cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once the girl's dark eyes opened;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bohannon found himself enveloped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gaze whose steady scrutiny, for all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravado, just a little abashed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father?" the girl asked, weakly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is he better?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss," replied the captain, with rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">a failure of trying to render his tone sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic, "miss, I wish you was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger. The news I got for you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her look widened. She struggled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat there trembling in the berth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bohannon boggled the divulgation</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsily as an elephant trying to play a</seg><seg type="columnLine">harp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean--don't take it too hard, miss,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he mustered enough hypocrisy to condole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I mean as how there's things happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all of us, now and again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean he's dead?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, his moorin's has slipped, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, in a manner of speakin'.

"Where is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Next cabin, miss. But you hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughta--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me go to him!

"But don't take it too</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. Not too doggoned hard, miss!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He led her to the cabin where the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lay, and opened the door for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't come in, please," she whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">brokenly. "I just want to be alone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, for the last time--alone ..."</seg><seg type="columnLine">HALF an hour on--a half hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which Bohannon had sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">herding his thoughts about rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery, Leadspitter, Bahia Blanca and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring Horn--the captain spatted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of several pipefuls and betook</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to the cabin of death. He knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood a moment in the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covertly smiling, his heart granitic with</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultation that things were so aptly fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his hand. But--</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ROARING HORN</seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, come," he made a shift of</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying in a voice that tried to soothe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laid an ape paw on her shoulder as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl knelt beside the bunk where lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead man. "Come now, miss, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">here don't do no good, grievin' don't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We all has to go by the board, all come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anchor forever, one time another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Takin' on, that don't help none. What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">done is done, ain't it? Well then, buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">up! That's what I say, miss--buck up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked at him a silent moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a courage that nobly partnered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief. Then she reached for his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed it.

Even in those few steps, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bohannon watched her slim grace, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew she had spoken truth. No woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">walks like that, who has not long been</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN she had vanished into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin Bohannon went to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a welt of rum, and--thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortified--sought Leadspitter in the mate's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He found Leadspitter barefoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in only undershirt and trousers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, stretched out in his bunk, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding in a smoky atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Time to give the old son of a one a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea toss," began the captain.

Leadspitter grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with yellow teeth. "That's one of 'em,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow, got rid of." And expectantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leadspitter sat up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Y'know, Mr. Furlong, he was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind o' deep water man, himself.

Almost as if he had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the blow that sent A1 spinning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he snatched up a heavy lighted lamp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled it above his head and flung it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Schmitz's raised forearm, smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his guard and covered him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken glass and burning oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the stunned second before the racket</seg><seg type="columnLine">began Jim took Rosie by the wrist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke through to the street. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the place seethed like an ants' nest</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid open by a spade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled her around the first corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They pelted through the snow as fast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could run.

They came at length to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wooden shack below the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk, on an unlighted street. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpainted boards were warped, it listed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily and, in common with all the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses in the block, it looked deserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Jim jumped down to it, key in hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by the time Rosie had descended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rickety steps that led from the sidewalk</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had opened the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shut it behind her, struck a match</seg><seg type="columnLine">and led the way into a room furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a stove, a camp cot, a chair and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small pine table with a smoke blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">ESPECIALLY DANCE HALL WOMEN</seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp on it. He lighted the lamp. Rosie</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into the chair, breathing in big pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful gulps. She wasn't used to running.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great altitude--ten thousand feet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had played havoc with her breath. Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swung a pick there too long to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">much affected. They looked at each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dim light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's jest a place to sleep," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkwardly. "Nobody knows I own it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feller gave it to me that struck it rich an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">went away. Mostly I'm in the hills any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how.

Why don't you go with me, an'--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' stay with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I ain't fit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're as fit as I am," he said quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the soft, rumbling, reassuring bass that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed kin to rivers and winds. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">d'you say to a clean break an' a new start</seg><seg type="columnLine">together?" He lingered on the last word</seg><seg type="columnLine">wistfully. "I've been pretty lonesome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, a-knockin' round from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospect hole to another an' livin' like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack rat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She got up and came close and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him intently. The yellow piano scarf</seg><seg type="columnLine">that covered her befrizzled red head like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incongruous cowl and clashed crudely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her red dress; her silver slippers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her spangles, the bunch of cotton roses at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her waist, her rouged cheeks and scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and half-bared heaving breasts con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trasted strangely with her honest eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you want it for yourself, Jim?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For myself--more'n anything."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're not lying to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So help me God."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had expected her arms about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, but she gave him her hand like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll never let you down," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly. "Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went out under a sky of faint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean blue, where a frosty moon queened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it amidst a scattering of small pale stars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found a man who was driving out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town in a wagon and went with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By one means and another they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way into the Gray Dome country</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jim built a cabin there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FIFTEEN years later, Rosie Briggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the door of it and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim climb down the steep trail to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward his latest prospect hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a fresh sprinkling of snow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so light and dry that the faint wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">started bits of it to rolling like feathers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beneath it the smells of spruce and pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and juniper and little silver mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage were dormant. The cold, clean, thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of early morning was stripped for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of Long Jim's pipe, and it drifted up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank and acrid. Rosie liked it, at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour and in that place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She watched him until he waved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand far below like a tiny marionette be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he took the fork of the trail under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big Engelmann spruce and disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the day. She waved back and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her tubs. Every week she washed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes of four families in Gray Dome, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mining town down the main road just</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the next bend. It was hard work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she didn't mind it much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She didn't think about it. Besides, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">only worked four days a week. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three she rested--sewed a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crocheted a little, knit a little--sweaters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stockings and mittens for Jim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, and kept her diminutive house as</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean as a chemist's scales; or sat quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in front in summer or inside by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stove in winter and let the long waves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace wash deeper and deeper in. Peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">is good after a life like Rosie's. She lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it thankfully, as in a bath, and soaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">old stains away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the side of Gray Dome Mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sheer drop of the canon at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and the range spread out beyond;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the midst of cleanness and silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMA and PAUL ELLERBE</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbroken since that old rocky backbone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the continent thrust itself up into the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had risen slowly out of the shards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life of Captain Mac and come, late</seg><seg type="columnLine">but surely, into her heritage of womanli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and dignity. The years had chipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away her prettiness, but in its place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty for those who could see it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth face had been sculptured into</seg><seg type="columnLine">something fine and strong and self-di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected, something steadfast and serene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wasn't blown about by tantrums any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had a stake in the game of life now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she played to hold it. She had stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ied to meet the responsibilities thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her by Jim. He was as kind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient as the seasons, and as unreliable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she was like a cottonwood tree; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">put out the leaves of her affection and</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence surely and abundantly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tireless caution and she rarely got</seg><seg type="columnLine">nipped. She controlled him where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be controlled, and where he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">she accepted him as she did the weather.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her knowledge of men was empirical, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hampered by theories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim would give anybody anything she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had--he possessed nothing himself--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be perennially surprized if she objected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usually she didp't, but if it was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing she wanted she went after it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got it back if she could. Any bum or</seg><seg type="columnLine">crook or sharper could win his friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pick his mind or his pocket if either</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to have anything in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Rosie's mind was her own, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of a pocket she used the Conifer</seg><seg type="columnLine">County Savings Bank. She met him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all points as shrewdly as if he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opponent--which in a sense he was--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she loved him. And she knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he loved her, and counted on it, but only</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what it was worth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She put more trust in his poverty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every day, of course, he expected to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And for a while she had thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might. But gradually as the days lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves down in long, pleasantly mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notonous rows until the sum of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">made many years, she came to know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't. And that, far more than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">love, was the foundation of her content.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While he was poor he was hers--wholly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unqualifiedly, unthinkingly hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor was scarcely the word, though.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim lived in a moneyless world. Out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little she made she supplied the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple necessities of both of them, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to wait for everything else until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck it. "Then--! Then--!" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he thought of as he made his slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">way up and down the mountainside. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the thought was roseate, luminous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejuvenescent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Rosie hated it. If for nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">else, because it held the seeds of possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">change. After a chancy life, she valued</seg><seg type="columnLine">most, of things attainable by human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, a life that was free from chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On this morning in spring an eagle</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted down the sky on wide, still wings;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice broke up and tinkled in Little Cub</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek in the canon; the orange and yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low shoots of the willows swelled out to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward catkins; and Rosie washed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes contentedly, secure in the knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge that there was no "then"; while over</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hole in the side of Old Baldy Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke up her world with quick excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows of a short-handled miner's pick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was hanging out the clothes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squawberry bushes at the back when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the impatient crash of his elk hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots. She went quickly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and stopped in the front door at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he swung up his heavy bag of</seg><seg type="columnLine">samples for a signal, she knew. Knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she heard his whoop. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cut across the stillness like the whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a locomotive it struck her cold. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled the core of her spirit, as an icy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind loosed in the tropics would chill a</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked native.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Struck it, by thunder! Two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars to the ton, if it's worth a cent!</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' the vein as plain as a layer o' choc'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late in a cake!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell into a chair on the porch. Rosie</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood and stared at him. The one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew was ore.

His "then" had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ESPECIALLY DANCE HALL WOMEN</seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. The realization went through her</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness in widening rings. What-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever else it meant, it meant the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this; the beginning of uncertainty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught her in his arms and swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">her into the cabin and danced her about</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the place shook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride in your own auto yet?

"I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">alius knowed it.

"Ain't you glad?" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was like a boat that has luffed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind.

Then they filled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained and she set out before this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold breeze. She told him as best she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could that she was glad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To look at you a feller might think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you was kinder sorry like," he said quiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zically. "What's the matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was thinkin' a little about how happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd been right here--just you and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the house you made yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Twarn't a patch on what it's gonna</seg><seg type="columnLine">be," he said, and jumped up and was off'</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his samples to the assayer's in Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dome. He stepped strongly, as a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man does. Half the stoop was gone from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rosie turned back slowly and sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily at the kitchen table, her occupa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion gone. Jim didn't need a grubstaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. She sat there a long time, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories of other miners who had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich swarmed in her brain like little devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fell over each other in their eagerness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stab her: Senator Sherrill, and Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potts, the hotel man, and Hooker Bates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who took his flier in Wall Street; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike Watson, who divorced his wife for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dora Schoonmaker, and a dozen others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They made their money and then were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered in by women like the Schoon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">makers. She had seen so many of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They always left the women they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up when they were poor. Espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially dance hall women. Even when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were their wives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And she and Jim had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">married.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT ROSIE BRIGGS wasn't a quit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. Little in her life had gone by</seg><seg type="columnLine">default. When the terms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale of the mine had been arranged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody in Conifer County knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim was going to be a rich man, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">capped his plans with hers and squared</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to meet what was coming. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">went over her clothes and spruced up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as she could to match her new</seg><seg type="columnLine">station. And very carefully she laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a program of buying to be carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as soon as the money came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among her things she found a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had clipped from a fashion mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">azine twelve years ago--a colored picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an electric-blue plush dress of a style</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had admired. She felt a twinge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sadness as she wondered how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things that she had wanted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone without would look as queer as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dress she had worn when Jim took</seg><seg type="columnLine">her out of the dance hall--the red dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the spangles on it--looked queerer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that night while Jim was in the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage on an errand after supper she put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and sat waiting for him by the fire, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to play such cards as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came in he stopped at the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little sitting room with a whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't seen that for ten years. Didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you had it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't much--" she said, smoothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had lengthened and renovated it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as best she could. It was the only piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of finery she owned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right. Lord, how purty I uster</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it was!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The windows were open to the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The weather had turned suddenly warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMA and PAUL ELLERBE</seg><seg type="columnLine">that day, as if the old earth had decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start life all over again with the Briggses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a moon, and the new tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves of the aspens about the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">made patterns on it that twinkled. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">could almost feel the soft wooly anemones</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusting up their oval spear points out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feel of it all had got into Rosie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart and driven out some of her fears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She even had her old banjo in her lap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wanted to prove to him that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to help him to be happy. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the strings and began to sing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew only the songs that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular a good while ago--"Daisy",</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Two Little Girls in Blue", "Sweet Rosie</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Grady" and one or two more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same sort. These, to her, were "music"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">all there was of it. She sang:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Daisy, Daisy,^give me your answer true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I'm half crazy, just for the love of you" . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felt a load slipping from her heart as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow slips from the summit of Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dome Mountain when warm weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh!" Jim murmured. "You ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sung that sence--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He let the sentence die. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled above his grizzling brown mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tache and beard. She wanted to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the banjo and go to him and touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. But she went on singing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased that she remembered the tune so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, that her voice rang out so clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, and Jim came and sat close beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange, deliciously sweet odor crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in under the smells of growing things and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet earth out there on the dripping moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainside. She felt just then that Jim was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as steadfast and as sure to stand by as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge silver spruce that the cabin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built against. She let her cheek rest on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder of his coat. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         "It won't be a stylish marriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        For I can't afford a carriage ..."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The odor came more strongly. It was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange flowers. She smiled at the senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental notion. Orange flowers on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Gray Dome--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     "But you'd look sweet--upon the seat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Of a bicycle built--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The odor came from Jim's coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It said suddenly, "Lorraine Schoon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker," as plainly as Jim's lips could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have said it. To smell it was to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl standing behind the counter in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gray Dome Dry Goods Company's store.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably there was no one in town who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have failed to connect her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perfume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A knife seemed to unfold inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosie. It cut her song off in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line and brought her upright in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair with a gasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter?" Jim said, startled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She got to her feet. She almost came</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight out with it. That would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been like her. It was what she wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. But for the first time in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years she was afraid. She stared at Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">with deep revulsion. Suddenly he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of an elemental horror that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed out of long ago and that now was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing around her again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I hadn't ought to've sung that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said thickly. "It--makes me think</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much of the old days," and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling off to the bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed her and stood around, say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing things to comfort her, and finally she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretended that her mood had passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when she lay still at last by his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thought about Lorraine Schoonma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ker, hard lines pulled at the corners of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth that hadn't been there for fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Long after all traces of it had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, she fancied that the air was faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched with the perfume of orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Women" would have been bad enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he would have tired of them and come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. There'd be no coming back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this girl of twenty-one, clever and hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind and soft and pink of body, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first taste of what money could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh in her mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Men didn't come back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schoonmaker women. Behind Lorraine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ESPECIALLY DANCE HALL WOMEN</seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her sleek black pomaded hair, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">short tight pussy willow taffeta one piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">gown, her chiffon stockings and high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heeled satin pumps with rhinestone</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckles, her vanity case almost as big as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a traveling bag, her jeweled wrist watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swinging bead girdle, Rosie saw Ally</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schoonmaker, her older sister, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">married Timothy Bund practically on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-bed for his house and his shares in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the North Star Mine. And behind Ally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ladder of the years a rung or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, Dora Schoonmaker, breaking up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson home when Mike Watson's mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to pay, and somehow juggling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a divorce from the woman who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him through the lean grim years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">penury and into marriage with her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then carrying him off East. And Effie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldest of the four, who had run away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Perce Williams, nearly two decades</seg><seg type="columnLine">her junior, when he came into his father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, and held him grimly to her side</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, and even Bertha Schoonmaker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mother, with her wig and her dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiffon blouses and her painted cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brown teeth and pink-lined hats with</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating pink veils, playing the man-game</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, at sixty-four. Their lean, rapacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schoonmaker hands were all alike If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorraine took Jim, she'd take him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep. At the altar. For very definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial ends of her own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tacit bargain between Long Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Rosie had never got itself into words;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hadn't felt the need of them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pulled her out of hell. The strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her allegiance to him couldn't be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased by the mere saying of words, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever sacred, or the giving of a ring. Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage would have added nothing to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of it. Nor, she had thought, to his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wished now that she had it, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not occurred to her to wish it before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had had something so much solider</seg><seg type="columnLine">in poverty. Marriage might hold and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not, but while he had been depen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent upon her for his food and clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been no doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She went back to that over and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, seeing the placid years in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little house as very beautiful through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist of pain. She had a feeling that, pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the almost forgotten cadences of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the song, she had brought the past down</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her ears. She felt the old trapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatalistic despair and sick rage, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old vigor. Something began banking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up inside of her, steadily, relentlessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was terribly afraid of it. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her that it was a great bubble of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood in her brain, and that when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst-- She tried to keep from thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ease the strain on it, but her thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed out swiftly from oubliettes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscure corners of her mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were hideous thoughts and really</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hers at all. It seemed that some devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent them to torture her. The unfair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of it gagged in her throat. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought her way out of filth and blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cleanness and the sun, and now, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out volition, the old horror came on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">again from within--clicked through her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain like yards and yards of cinema film.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The current of her life had swept past its</seg><seg type="columnLine">one clean tranquil place and was swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">along muddied and normal. The familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ache was in her heart, and Rosie was her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self again--Captain Mac, of Al's Dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall. You didn't get away from things</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, there were things that Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mac knew how to do that Rosie Briggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had forgotten. She had whipped a can</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the street once with revolver bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets as a child whips a hoop, to the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration of every idle man in town, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended the demonstration by shooting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's plug hat off his head with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out disturbing his hair. Her whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts showed her Jim's old .44 in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left-hand end of the bottom drawer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dresser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She must wait, she told herself--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heart gave a great bound--she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until she had them together! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed out with sudden raucous cruelty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the still cool night. Jim stirred in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep but didn't waken. She raised her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self on one elbow and looked down at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while her thoughts raced and danced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">piling themselves into the bubble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMA and PAULELLERBE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it burst and left her weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">with compassion, seeing them together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind's eye; seeing them as clearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daylight that was climbing over Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dome Mountain. That fragile, empty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart little thing and Long Jim Briggs!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaunt, weathered, grizzled old Jim--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her! She'd no more be able to shoot than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter into her dead mother's womb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be born again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feeling as old as the granite hills that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramparted the canon, and with some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing too of their plain ineluctable dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity, she arose and dressed herself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">built the breakfast fire in the stove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Jim came out to her she got slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to her feet, closed the damper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim," she said, "that girl don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Take a good look at yourself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror over there, and then think of her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She'll throw you away like a sucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange when the money's gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long Jim Briggs stood up with his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rafters of the tiny room and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an idiot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I smelled her perfumery on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat," said Rosie shortly, and compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension dawned slowly in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holy jumping June bugs!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">from somewhere down in his boots. "So</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's what you thought! Wait a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute. I was hidin' it in the wood house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted to surprize you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment he returned with a pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. With awkward swift movements he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripped off the wrapping paper and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the folds of a brilliant electric blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">plush dress of a fashion fallen into forgot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten desuetude ten years before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He displayed it pridefully down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of his long person, head a-cock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twinkle in his eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all there was between us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smell it!" The room reeked of orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">blossoms. "She made, it for me nights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make some extra money. It's the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">you kep' a picture of from a fashion book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got it off your dresser. Do you--do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it, Rosie?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to speak, but could only nod</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head. He patted her shoulder awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly. The dress swam before her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a pane of blue glass in the rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's goin' to be the swellest weddin',"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said huskily, "that little old Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dome ever seen. An' then--" he cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat with a rumble like summer</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder--"we're goin' to Denver an' buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">a house on Capitol Hill an' the finest auto</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town, an' a nigger to run it an' drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">around an' tell 'em all to go to hell!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The story of a flying lieutenant who went A. W.O.L.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In Line of Duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEAVY TRUCK lumbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly along a road in central</seg><seg type="columnLine">France. On both sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road was an uninspiring vista</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brown fields, stretching away as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the eye could reach, and only occasion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally broken by smalL clumps of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrubby trees. On the seat of the truck</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the driver sat a little man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooping mustache. This droopiness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence that he had come there by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Paris. When he reached the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital the mustache had been smartly</seg><seg type="columnLine">waxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he addressed the driver out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer boredom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty sad dump around here, ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?" he remarked obviously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sad?" inquired the truck driver, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse faced man with a large bulge in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek, who suggested mules rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical means of locomotion. "Sad?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Say, Lieutenant, you ain't seen nuthin*</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet! Wait till you see the fiyin' field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have to lay duckboards to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the airyplanes on. The only birds who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a good time around there are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dutchmen--prisoners, you know. I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em out a load of beer and cognac this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, and there was a hardboiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">M.P. sergeant ridin' the load to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure it all got there, an' it did, too. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the lucky suckers work in the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get all they want to eat, too--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dutch, I mean. Makes me sick to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' them krauts lyin' around with nuthin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do but stuff an' guzzle, while hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">workin' guys like me-- Look, there's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed ahead to a group of low</seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg><seg type="columnLine">H. P. S. GREENE</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrack buildings which clustered near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road on the left hand side. Farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">away could be seen several hangars, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no signs of activity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see any flying going on," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the lieutenant, whose name was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy Lang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, an' you won't prob'ly, till next</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring," returned the driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned off the rough but hard road</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gateway into the camp, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine of the truck began to labor as</seg><seg type="columnLine">its wheels sank deep into the soft mud, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shifted into second. Once more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck lurched forward, but only for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. The driver shifted back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, but the new impetus gained was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only temporary, and presently the chain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less wheels spun vainly. The driver shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his motor and climbed to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is as far as we can go, Lieuten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant," he said. "You'll have to lug your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own baggage in from here. The frogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't let us use chains on the road, so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took 'em away from us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He proceeded around to the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck and let down the tailboard with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bang. Tommy climbed down gingerly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but immediately sank almost to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. The driver was dragging out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed roll and trunk, which fell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with a squashy sound; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went around to the front of the truck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to labor at the crank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do I do now?" asked Tommy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There wasn't another soul anywhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Report to the personnel officer up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there," answered the driver, waving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm vaguely toward the row of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrack buildings nearby. So saying, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed once more to the seat and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to churn his way backward toward firmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">LEAVING the sad monument of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage, Tommy sloughed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">-^the mud until he reached a pathway</seg><seg type="columnLine">of duckboards which ran parallel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of barracks. On one of these build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings was a sign, and as he approached it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latest addition to the great American</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying field was able to see that it read</seg><seg type="columnLine">as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        PERSONNEL OFFICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        OFFICERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        FLYING OFFICERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        FLYING CADETS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        CADETS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the shepherd separates the sheep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the goats," thought Tommy as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed a short flight of steps and entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office. The shepherd, a small, pot</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellied man with captain's bars but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings on his serge blouse, eyed the newest</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying lieutenant, his whipcord uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his papers with disfavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right," he said in a querulous voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Find yourself a bunk in the flying offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cers' barrack. You will be assigned to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">section for duty. Look on the bulletin</seg><seg type="columnLine">board in the operations office."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy saluted and went out. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his baggage still forming an island in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea of mud, but it seemed to have shrunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciably since he left it. He had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that he must salvage it before it dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walking along the duckboard, he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chorus of voices raised in ribald song</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the barracks and stopped, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had reached a friendly haven.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When I joined the Army I was clean and neat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noise ceased abruptly as the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Attention!" shouted one voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ma-a-a-a-ah!" said another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was full of irreverent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">antagonistic cadets, and Tommy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated, feeling that it was not the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop and explain that the only reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not among them was through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake of some nodding Homer in Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington in giving him a commission as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as he enlisted, instead of when he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pilot's license. The song followed him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The officers live on the top of the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The flying cadets in the slush and the swill--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I don't want any more Array.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gee, how I want to go home."</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN LINE OF DUTY</seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to the last barrack of all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was only about three-fourths built.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Going inside, he found it empty of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, but the contents was reassuring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the neatly spread double-decker</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunks were officers' bools, and the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were covered with overcoats bearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">single stripe of a first lieutenant, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">various flying clothes and equipment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In what would be the middle of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">building was a single large stove which</seg><seg type="columnLine">feebly radiated its rays of heat against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blasts of cold damp air from the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. Near that end were several unoc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied bunks, one of which Tommy de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided must be for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS commencing to get dark out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and colder, too. The little flyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled closer to the stove and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked a cigaret. Somebody must come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in before long. Somebody did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a clatter on the duckboards</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside and a horde of flying lieutenants</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouped in, making loud noises and crowd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around the stove. Tommy scanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces anxiously, but there was no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body there he knew. A tall, thin man</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed him in a friendly manner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy asked him t9 help him with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage. The other assented readily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they excavated the large French</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk and fancy bed roll which marked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had enlisted in Paris, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one dragged them inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might as well take this bunk next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me and Fat," said the tall man, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was known as Long John. "We got left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind for a day in Paris by accident, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we got here the barrack was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">full up, so we had to take bunks near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. What ground school did you go to?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I never went to ground school," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned Tommy. "I was an ambulance</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver and enlisted in Paris."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked around curiously at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions in the barrack. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an unfamiliar genus, men who had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their preliminary training and got their</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissions in the States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were various strange divisions in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the early days of the Air Service in France.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the French school at Tours there were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outwardly at least, several different</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeds of Americans. First the Foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">Legion trained there, and then a lost or</seg><seg type="columnLine">strayed detachment of American gobs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the Army started enlisting men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris, mostly former ambulance drivers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who continued the old feud between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Ambulance and Norton Harjes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but united in scorn for those whose service</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been confined to the Mexican</seg><seg type="columnLine">Border.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one day a body of men marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">into camp in column of fours, a military</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution which the ambulance drivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded with pitying contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are those men?" the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ground school men," was the reply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ex-ambulanciers immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined together in one clique against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Tommy was meeting a new divi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion in the ranks of the flyers--those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not only been to ground school, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had preliminary flying training in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He inquired after various of his friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to find that they had been trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to a more advanced field; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing that more than an hour still re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained before supper, he started down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road toward a house he had noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the truck brought him to the field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he might find a drink there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly some one he knew. He was cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shivering and thought longingly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woolen underwear sent him by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt, which was buried in his trunk. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">years he had worn nothing but so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">athletic underwear, but the time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently come to change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He approached the house, a solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm, but still somehow suggestive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid refreshment. The door stood open</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitably, and he walked in. His nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not deceived him, for though there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no 6ne in the room, a small bar stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">along one end, and when the gnarled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped lady of the establishment came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, he ordered a glass of rum. The strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor warmed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg><seg type="columnLine">H. P. S. GREENE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a puttering roar outside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motorcycle pulled up at the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy observed the evident agitation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Madame with surprise. Then a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a hard face came inside. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Tommy threateningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have a drink," invited the little pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in friendly tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hated to drink alone, even if he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold. The other, who wore a brassard</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his arm like a stretcher bearer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French army, agreed in a surly man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. Tommy wondered who the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as he gulped his drink, and waited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if the other would return the compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, as was in vogue in those days. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't, and Tommy turned to leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, feller," said the surly one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Guess I'll have another one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, if you like," answered Tommy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ordered and paid for another round.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something peculiar here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't understand. Just then there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the sound of another motorcycle</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The officer of the day!" exclaimed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough man with the arm band, rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Tommy heard his voice raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">placatingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," it said. "I just went in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if there was anybody inside, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no one there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, get on with the patrol," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">another voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two motorcycles roared away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy was bewildered. He left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cafe and walked back to the barrack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he could find out there what it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant. Although he bore lieutenant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars on his shoulders, he was as innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Army and its ways as a baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AT THE open ended barrack he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the flying lieutenants gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*• ered around the stove. Among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was Long John, and he singled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and told him his queer story. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy's surprise he burst into raucous</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey,Fat! Hey, guys! Listen to this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will ya! This bird goes up the road to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cafe that's out of bounds, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the M.P. comes in he asks him to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Chorus--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah. And then he wonders why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">M.P. don't buy him one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fact, and then the M.P. tells him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy another one, and he does!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then the officer of the day drives</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and the M.P. tells him there's no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in there, and they ride off, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">this bird wants to know what it's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A howl of glee went up, and from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment Tommy became a marked man</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Issy-la-Boue, as he had a habit of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere he went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bugle blew at this juncture and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying officers rushed to their bunks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized peculiar looking instruments with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they went outside. Still wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Tommy followed them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS dark by that time, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see them trouping into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly lighted building, and he fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed. There they had formed in line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were approaching a counter behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stood cropheaded fat men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ladling out what Tommy's nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him was food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they were served the flyers hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to seat themselves on long benches</seg><seg type="columnLine">at bare wooden tables and wolf their meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy accosted the large man whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long John had addressed as Fat, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk had evidently cut down his speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he was near to the end of the line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say," he asked, "where do I get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those things they eat out of?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What, ain't you got no messkit?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried Fat. "You'll have to draw one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning. For tonight you'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrow Long John's. He's always in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the line when the doors open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he eats faster than any man in the outfit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But where have you been in the Army not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a messkit?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We always ate in the canteen at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN LINE OF DUTY</seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg><seg type="columnLine">French flying school until the Y.

A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">came along and closed it up because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">served wine there," answered Tommy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They made a speech about the evils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink and were going to serve chocolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead, but the chocolate never came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that we generally ate at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greasy Spoon across the road, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they didn't serve anything but boiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">beef and boiled potatoes at the mess</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, but even there they furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you'll get no dishes furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," said Fat. "But look, there goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long John already. Follow him out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tubs, and get his messkit when he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">through washing it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy trailed the tall man out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold, dark night, where several dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms could be seen and heard slopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">around near two large tubs on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As John rose from his task and shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools in lieu of wiping them, Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">accosted him and borrowed the messkit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he rushed back into the mess hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time to get the last of the slum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He eyed the German K.

By this time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was stone cold, and full of frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of food. Cries for more hot Wasser</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent the air, but the German K. P.'s only</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in their warm kitchen and laughed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made guttural and doubtless insult-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing remarks in reply. After the iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline of their own army, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tickled pink at the opportunity to insult</seg><seg type="columnLine">any kind of officer, even an American</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviator, who was the lowest of the low.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy wiped most of the grease out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dish with his handkerchief and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned the mess kit to Long John at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrack with an apology.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TALL MAN and Fat were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to start for the operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">room to find out the schedule for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day, and invited Tommy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come along. On the bulletin board he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that he had been assigned to Sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion 13. Various other changes in sect ions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were posted, butnthe last one took his eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It read:</seg><seg type="columnLine">1st. Lieut. John Smith, A.

Oh, they always do that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">some bird gets bumped," answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall man. "You're in Section 13, same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as me. We go to rotary motors in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, and then machine gun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean, rotary motors?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired Tommy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, they've got one of these Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rhone motors like they have in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nieuports mounted on a block over at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hangars, and some goof gives a lecture</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, and then we practise twiddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little levers--'manettes', they call</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em--that make it go.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made all my voyages and my altitude test</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my brevet with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind that," returned Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">John. "You'll probably have all the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectures about 'em on that account."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They returned to the barrack, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy started to unpack his things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From his bed roll he produced a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber boots, made in such a close imita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of regulation officers' boots that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a close inspection to see that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't the real article.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What a trick for roll call mornings,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed Fat, looking at them enviously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know we have roll call at six</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock, and then we have to wait until</seg><seg type="columnLine">110</seg><seg type="columnLine">H.

Major Krause, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanding officer of the field, a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced, apoplectic man, whose military</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroes were Frederick the Great and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baron von Steuben, was roaring at the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutant, his "yes man".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here they are," he bellowed, "sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">us another squadron of mechanics, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we haven't got half enough room or work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ones we have now. I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we'll do with them. We'll have to t ry</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pry another of those folding barracks out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the French. And they have no officers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and neither have we, though there's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole camp full of young fools with com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missions around .here. But we'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick out one of them to command the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squadron, just to sign the reports that go</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Have you anybody to suggest?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," said the adjutant, "here's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man got in today named Lang, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission dates back to September,</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier than most of the others, but I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know anything about him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know too much about most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others," said Major Krause. "Give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trial. Perhaps he may know something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his military duties. By the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you tell the commanding officer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those officers in the unfinished barrack</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if they wanted it finished they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it themselves?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir, and they said they hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">got cards to the Flying Carpenters'Union,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they didn't give a damn whether it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished or not. They kicked a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">about having to go out and pick up stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the flying field in full uniform, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the German prisoners stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and laughed at them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They did, did they?" roared Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">Krause. "What they need is discipline,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm going to give it to them!

He was cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramped from the night on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow bunk with insufficient blankets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a moment he thought that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the ambulance sleeping on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretcher. Then he saw the other flyers</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing out of the barrack and realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was. He rolled quickly out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bunk, dragged on the rubber boots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffled into his trench coat, which barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered his bare knees, grabbed his hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran out after them, only to slip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">come turn bling o ut of the barrack head first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid hoarse guffaws from the other suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferers lined up outside. It had snowed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of inches during the night, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp flakes bit into his tender knees. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled to his feet and lined up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The short, fat captain to whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported the day before called the roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his squeaky voice, and then at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his lungs cried--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Squads right!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A horrified look ran up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scantily clad ranks, but the "March!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed grimly and inevitably. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain, who had been a real estate broker</seg><seg type="columnLine">two short months before, had forgotten to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have them call off, and they broke into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">milling mob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you were!" he howled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ranks formed again, after a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable delay, during which several</seg><seg type="columnLine">men tried to sneak around the corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrack, and the captain finally got</seg><seg type="columnLine">them marched away. To Tommy, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as to the late realtor, and most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest, it was a doleful hike. With every</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, the man in front scuffed snow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN LINE OF DUTY</seg><seg type="columnLine">111</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally cold mud up against his bare, raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, and soon his boots were full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In other parts of the great field where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they marched there were other proces-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sions of unfortunates, one of flying cadets,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of cadets, and also several companies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of mechanics. They, however, had the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">advantage of expecting the march, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were fully dressed. Most of the flying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lieutenants were not. But at last it came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to an end, and in the doubtful shelter of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the barrack once more Tommy wiped the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mud from his cold wet knees with a towel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Where can I take a bath?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  John cackled with raucous glee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bath?" he snorted. "Hey, guys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here's an hombre wants to know where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take a bath."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bath?" said Fat. "Why, Paris is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last place I had a bath, and I don't expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have another one till I die and go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. You'll get no baths here. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bath-house in town, but you can't go</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, for the post's been quarantined ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it was started. The M.P.'s know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that anybody that goes A. W. O. L. will</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a bath, so they keep a special guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">ov er the bath-house to pick you up, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like at the barrooms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They dressed, went*to the mess hall for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beans, washed their mess kits, and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formed in sections to march to classes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">First Section 13 spent an hour standing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around in the blast from the propeller of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rotary motor, and then went to an un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heated barrack to handle the icy parts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a Lewis machine gun. After which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were allowed to escape to the Red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cross hut and buy some hot coffee. Hard-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly had they reached this haven when an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orderly entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lieutenant Lang," he bawled. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Lang here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tommy took an envelope addressed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, signed for it and opened it with ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension. This was well justified, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter told him to assume command of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fethe 946th Aero Squadron upon its arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the field. He showed it to Fat and Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, who once more burst into laughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can you imagine the lucky little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff?" John inquired of the world in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general. "Here's a guy knows so little</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Army that he doesn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">know an M.P. when he sees one, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here he gets command of a squadron.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll get out of reveille and standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning formation on that, and have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly to shine your boots for you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can have them build off a separate room</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you in their barrack with a stove in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Pretty soft for a squadron com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander, I'll say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But what will I command them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do?" Tommy asked anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Let Old Krause and the adjutant</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about that," returned John.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They'll find plenty of commands for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. But turn everything over to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">top sergeant and make him do it. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, 'Look here, Sergeant, if you won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother me, I won't bother you.' Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">all you have to do is look wise and sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers that the sergeant-major or</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff sergeant bring you, and keep out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Krause's way."</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the squadron arrived Tom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my followed John's half joking</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice and found that it suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded admirably. The men partitioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">off one end of the barrack after they got</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up, and there made an office for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant-major and one for Tommy, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he set up a G. M. cot. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this office had to have a stove, and so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">served splendidly for quiet games of stud</seg><seg type="columnLine">which continued long after lights were out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the quarters of the flying lieutenants</seg><seg type="columnLine">less fortunate than Tommy and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cronies. And he got along well in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">command by keeping out of sight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">signing unquestioningly the morning re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports, rosters, ration reports and what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nots his sergeants brought him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But one morning the sergeant-major</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached him with a troubled face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what to do about this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant," he said, holding out a letter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I sent it to the adjutant three times and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he always sends it back marked 'Incor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rect.'

GREENE</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill against him for twenty-five cents for</seg><seg type="columnLine">repairing his breeches at Shenannigan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Field, Texas. Now here is his service</seg><seg type="columnLine">record, and it shows a deduction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter made there in July for fixing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeches, and he says that's the only time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ever had it done, but they've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding up his pay for three months."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Holding up his pay, have they?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy angrily. "Sent the letter back</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times? We'll see about that. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it up to the adjutant myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He entered the adjutant's office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke loudly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, what's all this, about Corporal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Letar's pants?

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, that's what's wrong," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjutant smoothly. "Where's your gram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mar? Haven't you ever been to school?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What you should say is: 'Twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents were deducted from Corporal Letar's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay at Shenannigan Field, Texas--' "</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's this?" burst an angry roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an inner office, as Major Krause</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed out. "What's all this about pants?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who's this talking about pants? Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know there's no such thing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States Army as pants? Who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, young man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy stood speechless at the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst. Why, oh why, hadn't he kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">following Long John's advice about keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of sight?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Lieutenant Lang, sir," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adjutant silkily, "the commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer of the 946th Aero Squadron on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Post. We were discussing a very serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">error in one of his reports."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it is, is it?" said Major Krause</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily. "I was going to send for you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued orders that all commanding officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of organizations on this post should per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonally give their units an hour's close</seg><seg type="columnLine">order drill every morning. Yesterday</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning I saw a sergeant drilling your</seg><seg type="columnLine">squadron. Where were you, sir? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't you drilling them yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," blurted Tommy, "I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to drill 'em.

You, a commissioned officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the United States Army, stand there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and admit that you are not capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drilling the men under your command?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, sir, you are hereby relieved from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that command. Remove yourself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your belongings from the 946th Squadron's</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrack at once, to make room for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">successor. And, young man, remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">this: Never give 'You don't know how'</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an excuse in the United States Army.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you don't knoto how, learn how! If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get an order, do it, and if you can't do it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do as near it as you can. That will do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You may go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">TOMMY dragged himself away dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consolately, and had a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of his late command carry his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff back to the barrack with the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. It was colder than ever now, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm quarters from which he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousted. But on the other hand, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a blessing in disguise. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been flying lately, and had graduated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the penguins whose wings were too</seg><seg type="columnLine">short to fly, and from the gawky twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">three meter Nieuports, and now he was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eighteens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ought to be finished with them soon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he would be due to move away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the main field to Field 5 for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller, faster fifteen meter machines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps there would have been some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitch about going if he'd been hooked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the squadron, but now he could leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he was ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he was ready to go somewhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. He'd now been quarantined at Issy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">la-Boue for over a month and hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to leave the post for a bath. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't the measles or the mumps it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chicken pox, or somebody had a sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">toe. There was a spreading line of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotches around his waist, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">only too well what it was. The scabies!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And from his experience with the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew there was only one cure--hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur baths with a scrubbing brush, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN LINE OF DUTY</seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of them. They had them at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath-house in town, but he couldn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. HoweAer, perhaps something would</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn up; it always did, sooner or later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did the next day. He finished flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">early, and returned to the barrack. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in, the telephone rang and he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. An excited voiced called:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, is this the Main Field? This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Field 5. Tommy Lang just crashed here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an eighteen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hah?" said Tommy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, deader'n a doornail, too. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole top of his head's gone above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. An awful mess. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we knew who it was was by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustache."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spreader of bad news hung up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Tommy dazed. He pinched him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to make sure that he was alive. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be Phil who had crashed. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustache like Tommy's own, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about six feet tall, while Tommy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer five. However, no doubt he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled up like an accordion in the fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Tommy had another thought. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the telephone receiver and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adjutant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IATER that evening when the orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the operations office with</seg><seg type="columnLine">-* notices for the bulletin board Tom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my was waiting for him. An hour later</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him luxuriating in a hot sulphur</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath in the town of Issy-la-Boue. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a ride on a French truck from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, and there had been no M.P.'s on</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty when he went in. When he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there were two near the door, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was pitch dark, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrangling about something--a girl, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently--and he passed unnoticed. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought a hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The madame in charge was cordial and</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But yes, she had plenty of room. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale guerrel There were hardly any com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercial travelers nowadays. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that salaud of a chief American gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">darme who spent nothing himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbade her hotel to other brave Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans who would! Indeed, he had closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the cafes and hotels in town to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen, and opened a cafe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own, importing two petites femmes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Paris to run it for him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was another American officer--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man very distinguished--at her hotel who</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared lonesome. Perhaps this worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsieur would like to join him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She led Tommy to a small office of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, wherein a man in American uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sitting gloomily alone before a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wine. The little pilot recoiled at sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gold leaves on his shoulders, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't Major Krause who sat there. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">this major's blouse were the Legion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honor, the Medaille MUitaire, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Croix de Guerre with many palms, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jingling hardware Krause carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show that he was a marksman or</seg><seg type="columnLine">something; and this man's face lit up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a welcoming smile, instead of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested dignity habitual with the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding officer of the flying field of Issy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">la-Boue. Tommy gasped as he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was in the presence of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace himself!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down at the other's invitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had a glass of wine. They joined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamenting the fact that they couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang all M.P.'s on the meat-hooks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of butcher shops as the poilus did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gendarmes at Verdun, and agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French are a great people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at me," said the ace gloomily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When I took this commission I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that they were going to order me</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the front, but now all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others are killing more Boches and get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting ahead of me while I rot in this hole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They sent me back here to help train you</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows, but Major Krause wouldn't pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">any attention to what I said, so I left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard some guy who had never flown</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the front give you a lecture on how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it, and when he said that if you got lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Germany the way to find out where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were was to fly down and read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name on some railway station, I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear it any more. I don't know what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil to do--I'm not doing any good</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His gloom was justified. A few months</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg><seg type="columnLine">H. P. S. GREENE</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he was shot down in flames in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine condemned by the French.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They heard the voice of the madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised in loud objurgations outside, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a knock at the door, afad im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately a man entered. He wore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform of a first lieutenant, and on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm the brassard of an M.P. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">truculence subsided into oiliness at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the major's leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse me, Major," he said, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders are very strict, you know.

At the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time his scabies was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess I'd better be getting back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field," he told the ace.

Buck felt sad in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen drinks under his belt. Sad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonesome and restless.

The door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the express car opened.

He hid the box under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loading chute, then started back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The walk in the cold air had driven the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky fog from his brain. Buck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober now. The sadness, the brooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessness, had gone and in its place</seg><seg type="columnLine">came swift regrets. He fought down those</seg><seg type="columnLine">regrets as best he could. He'd been a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do it, but he was into it now. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang and rattle. Play 'er out as the cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell and ask no man for better than even</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds. He wondered how hard he'd hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that depot feller. Can't let a man lay out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cold that way.

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">gents gits all the luck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But for all their banter, they felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy. Who among them had stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that five thousand dollars ? Oddly enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no man blamed the thief. They rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">admired his ingenuity. He had made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky haul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Dick," said Horace slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"whoever done it, must 'a' been blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk. You know every man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit. There ain't one rotten egg in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch.

He heard them</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got ary idee who might 'a' done it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Horace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I have, I'll keep it to myself," came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tart reply. "I look to you boys to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lend me a hand and all I git is some</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrawin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No need to git hot about it," grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon boss, toying with his drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff ignored that remark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his bartender.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO HATED HIMSELF</seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was all of these men in the place at</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight when No. 3 come in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bartender smoothed his bald head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in grave thought. He had taken a goodly</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of drinks since the boys got in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Owl eyed, he tallied the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Near as I kin recollect, Dick, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man o' them has left since I come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from supper-«.t eleven."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then that alibis this bunch of cow</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodgers," and the sheriff moved on out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ROBBERY gave the cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">punchers a meaty topic for talk--</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk and more drinks. They hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the idea of following Dick Powell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his sleuthing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From one saloon to the next they wad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled in the wake of the annoyed sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd had taken on numbers until by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time they reached the Bloody Heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire outfit was crowded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Various bartenders had furnished iron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad alibis for every Circle C man. Powell</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave up in disgust and slipped away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throng, which was growing somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">boisterous. Horace followed the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the back door. Twenty-five cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">punchers set about .to make the most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the momentous occasion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">' Months of hard work in the saddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">branding corrals without a holiday, long</seg><seg type="columnLine">days from the crack of dawn until dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two hours night guard for good</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure, had starved them for a little fun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These men belonged to a breed that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">no equal. For forty dollars a month and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub they ride mean horses, face death</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hunger and thirst and cold and bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">discomforts. They ask no favors, whine</seg><seg type="columnLine">out no complaint, taking the good along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bad. It is all in a day's work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of them were cowmen at twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of age. At sixty there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of the boy left in their big hearts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is not for those who have not known</seg><seg type="columnLine">their breed to censure their faults. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived according to their lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Law and his rules meant little in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives. They had a way of settling</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal affairs, those men who roamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the West in the Eighties when the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they held kangaroo court. The bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender at the Bloody Heart was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">guilty and fined several rounds of drinks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they moved on to the next saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again held court. Another dispenser</seg><seg type="columnLine">of redeye was found guilty. Guilty as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell, by ballot. The fine was duly paid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid form. And at daybreak they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">routed the sheriff from his warm bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood him up on the bar, clad in a knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">length nightshirt, boots, hat and a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret. Ballots were passed, signed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped in Dick's hat. He read them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one by one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guilty as hell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gash damn' you bonehead, misfit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loco idiots!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he paid the fine, setting out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses and bottle with his own hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a large night. Guns popped</seg><seg type="columnLine">jubilant greeting to a day that held no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard ride after stray cattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of them were flat broke. Cotton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eye, the bloated financier, had lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">money and hocked his spurs for a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take along. Then he engaged the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender in conversation while a confederate</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole back the spurs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horace gathered his men one, by one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted them, and started them out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. They bucked their horses down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street, emptying their guns at a leaden</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Behind them was their night's plea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. Ahead lay the dread winter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUCK BELL got his private horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the barn. Because he owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">no overcoat, he donned his slicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrapped his feet in strips of gunny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack. Alone, his hat pulled down across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, his ungloved hands shoved down</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the saddle cantle, he rode out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he neared the stockyards he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. No living thing moved in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow swept world that met his eye. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung off his horse and dragged the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">box from under the loading chute. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy padlock fastened it. Buck drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg><seg type="columnLine">WALT COBURN</seg><seg type="columnLine">his .45 and shot off the lock. His stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers pried up the lid. There lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banknotes in piles bound with wide rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber bands. He shoved the money into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep pockets of his angora chaps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he buried the empty metal box in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the debris under the chute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes later he rode on again</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the storm. He looked old and sadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled. The bitter cold was pinching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color from his face. He was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick from the liquor that he had drunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sick and lonesome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the lane and past the grave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard, on to the wind swept benchland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed south toward the badlands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missouri River, almost a hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. With the wind at his back, Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell drifted. His heart was as heavy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaden sky. Ahead of him rolled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant tumbleweed. On and on, across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench, grotesque, almost alive, blown</seg><seg type="columnLine">along by the north wind. Headed south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the pockets of his black chaps was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowed more money than he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen or even dreamed of. There was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of the theft being fastened to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been easy, almost too easy to seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">true. With five thousand dollars a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could buy a good bunch of cattle down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Mexico or Arizona. Buck was cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man enough to make a herd pay. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean that he no longer need work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for wages. For forty a month . . . Forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">into five thousand. Buck was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at figures. One hundred and twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five months. Ten years and more, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man didn't spend a dime for poker or</seg><seg type="columnLine">redeye or smokin'--or clothes. Socks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">such. He had sold his bed for twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. That twenty was in his vest</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket now. He had kept it separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other money--the money he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sam Bass was born in Indiana; it was his na-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tive home . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The song, high pitched, quavering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted along the wind from behind Buck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred a little in the flurry of hard snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swirled across the ground like white</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. Buck halted as the singer came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the storm. It was Dick Powell, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMETHING hot scalded Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell's heart as the rider came</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside. Had the sheriff some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how found him out? Buck almost hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. But Powell grinned as easy greeting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was warmly clad in chaps, overshoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a buffalo coat. The stock of a car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bine jutted from his saddle scabbard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look fer all the world like a bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's been whipped outa the herd, Bell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, see what this'll do to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed over a quart of whisky. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank together and rode on with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trailin' that gent that done the rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery, Dick?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff grunted into his fur collar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Trailin' hell! Whoever done it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave a sign. But mark my words, Bell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll give hisself away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck Bell slapped his cold hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the slicker to beat the blood into</seg><seg type="columnLine">circulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, take these." The sheriff pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pair of yarn mitts from his pocket. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brung along an extra pair. The missus</seg><seg type="columnLine">knit 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck pulled on the red mittens, mum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling his gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?" The sheriff replied to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. "Well, it's thisaway, Bell. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know every man that was in town that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. I know where each man will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">workin' this winter. Horace gimme their</seg><seg type="columnLine">names and what camps they'd be at. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wired fer the serial number of them sto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len banknotes. When that money begins</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' into circulation, I'll nab my man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Er if ary man quits this range, I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">follerin' him. I'll have the other towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted. He's corralled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff consulted a little book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here's the list. Stuart and Contway</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Big Warm. Howe and Smith at Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warm. You and Cotton Eye at Rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Point, down on the Missouri. And so on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shoved the book back into his poc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ket. Buck's head was lowered as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO HATED HIMSELF</seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled with clumsy hands at a witch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knot in his horse's mane. His brain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working swiftly. Why had Horace lied?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why had the wagon boss told the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he, Buck Bell, was going into a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp at Rocky Point?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't be tellin' this to everybody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand," continued the sheriff. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I kin trust you, Bell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the sheriff had taken a sharp knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck the cowpuncher in the back he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have hurt Buck Bell more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did when he spoke those words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rode on in silence. Buck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled to the bone by the wind; it bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his inadequate clothing. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged the bottle on him to warm his blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I got some stuff that'll be driftin' with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storms this winter, Bell. I spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Old Gent about it. He said it'd be all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right if you boys kinda kept an eye on 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feed a few if need be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shore," mumbledBuck. "Shore thing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their trails parted a little farther on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sheriff made Buck take his overshoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be back home in a couple o' hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't be a damn' fool, Bell. So long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good luck, old-timer. See you next</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring when the chinook melts you outa</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bad lands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had parted Buck rode on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ache in his heart more bitter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. The words of the sheriff's song</seg><seg type="columnLine">came drifting back out of the storm--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">song of Sam Bass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " . . . Sam he is a corpse and six foot under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  clay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck stayed that night at a line camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed on the next morning. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept wondering why Horace had lied. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung like a sand burr in his thoughts all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that day. He stopped late the next after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon at a horse camp; and because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were short handed, Buck worked there a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week. Then he drifted on once more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">refusing a cent for his labors. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethics of the grub line that forbade his</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepting payment. They had given him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his horse food and shelter. He asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more, though the work had been hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had eaten but two meals each day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Breakfast before they rode away; supper</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they came in after dark. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the biscuits, helped with the dishes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and split wood, to boot. And he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given them what was left of the whisky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BECAUSE Rocky Point lay along his</seg><seg type="columnLine">route to somewhere south, he rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there one evening at dusk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A saddled horse was humped in the lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shed. Hollow eyed cattle bawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the corral. No smoke came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little log cabin. Filled with grave mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">givings, Buck Bell stepped into the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moan of a man in pain came out of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark interior. He found Cotton Eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying fully clothed in bed, his leg broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the ankle and knee. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been like that since the day before, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Buck through set teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Horse fell on me, cornin' up the river."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck built the fire and made the crip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled man as comfortable as possible. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took care of the horses and scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hay for the gaunt cattle. When he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the cabin, he hid his fears under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless banter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll throw some soup into you, Cotton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eye. And coffee. Now roll over on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and cuss me while I git this boot</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off. I'll be as gentle as a cow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her first calf, pardner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those men of the frontier were steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hand and ingenious of brain. Broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones and gunshot wounds were not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">common. A man needed to know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudiments of crude surgery in those days</seg><seg type="columnLine">when doctors were few and far between.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sleep for either man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Buck fashioned a sling to hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering man while he pulled the frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured bone into place. The erstwhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">nighthawk groaned. Buck swore softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he labored. He splinted the leg with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout willow sticks and strips of tanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">rawhide saddle strings. Beads of sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the drawn face of Cotton Eye. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay back, whimpering a little through</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched teeth, sick and faint, but game</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. Buck held a cup of black coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg><seg type="columnLine">WALT COBURN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's all over but the knittin', pard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here's a cigaroot.

His chaps with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their precious store of money hung on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden peg with his bridle. Now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he glanced that way, his lips smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">without humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saved my life, Buck. I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fergittin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You better try to sleep, feller," grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cotton Eye lay there, a little flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fever, his eyes brighter than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder, Buck, if you'd be doin' this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fer me if you knowed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Knowed what, Cotton Eye?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That money I won off you.

But a man's gotta have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kinda excitement around a cow</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, even if it's playin' poker with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked deck. I was ketchin' on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">markin's about the time I went broke."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cotton Eye was delirious by morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck was forced to tie the man down</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he fed and watered the cattle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because there was only one bed, Buck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out with the saddle blankets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sick man's overcoat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the days that followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck Bell did the work of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. He chopped wood, cooked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nursed Cotton Eye, whose fever went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down slowly. He rode out each day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering poor cows that were too weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rustle. He hooked up the work team</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hauled hay, scattering it in a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle outside the corral. He opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water hole twice a day. He puttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the cabin, fixing it for the long win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and forced a cheerfulness into the chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter that he flung at Cotton Eye. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally crawled into his improvised bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully clothed save for hat and boots, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too weary to mind the cold much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He killed a beef one evening. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">night he brought in a square piece of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide and worked on it with his pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's have that good leg o' your'n,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardner." Buck wrapped the hide about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leg, nodded, marked it with his knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the hide back to his seat by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Them splints kin come off in a day er</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. I'm fixin' a sorter casin' to fit around</seg><seg type="columnLine">that game laig. This hide'll be plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and we'll lace it, savvy? Padded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the felt from a man's hat, she'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cast that'll be useful and right orna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental, with the hair on the outside. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretchin' it around this wilier pole to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make 'er smooth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck tanned the rest of the hide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made himself moccasins and a coat that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ill fitting but warm enough. He kil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led a blacktail buck and they feasted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">venison. Buck spent his evenings tanning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hide. The rawhide cast, smooth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and padded with felt from Buck's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat, now replaced the willow splints.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck wore a cap made out of a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hudson's Bay blanket.

The hay was giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Buck worked on a snowplow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle in the field grew in number each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.

His daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors brought peace of mind.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands that shook with eagerness, he undid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slicker. A choking cry broke from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsing throat. The money was gone. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. The slicker held nothing but some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraps of old newspaper, rudely cut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundled in imitation of the bank-notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time Buck squatted there on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, staring with dazed eyes at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slicker and its mocking contents. A rack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, horrible laugh rattled from his dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the end of the trail. All about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin the gaunt eyed cattle walked aim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, bawling. Buck went back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin and began packing. When his grub</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sacked and his bed rolled he went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the barn and hooked the team to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude snow plow. He tied his saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse to the off horse and loaded his bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grub on the snow plow.

Their dumb faith was pinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the man and his horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> South into the breaks across the frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">river.

I knowed that Hesbern's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad!" Culder gasped. "I'll go down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find 'im, 'f I can!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hurried to the strollers' camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, where the strangers usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. He saw Hesbern's wagon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his two heavy draft horses staked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass on the creek bottom; but Hesbern's</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddlehorse, a beauty, was nowhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The city marshal went over to the outfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the strangers had been delayed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a baby and by the sickness of a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Hesbern?" the city marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded of the weak but convalescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Marshal--" the man shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head--"I don't know. Las' night my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife's mother broke a bottle we had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on the baby's stomach to keep it</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm, an' Mr. Hesbern went uptown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">git another. My wife figured a two</seg><seg type="columnLine">quart'n 'd be better, and so he brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">one back, a big 'n.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ast if we'd get along right, 'fore he went.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Course, I c'n git around, now. He left</seg><seg type="columnLine">this order to look after his outfit, account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him gettin' important news."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> City Marshal Culder returned to Boxel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der Court House Square. He told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff, coroner and prosecutor what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew. They had a jury sit over Cock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eye Baer's remains, and they rather side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped the question of who, why and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence the killing. That night in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">One Way Thru Saloon the boys gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrowfully along the bar, staring at Cock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eye's apron, spotted, large and limp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging right where Cock Eye himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hung it, just the other night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor Cock Eye!" City Marshal Culder</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head. "We're goin' to miss that</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, yes, indeedy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's so-- Don't seem possible, does</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My lan', he was funny, too, the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he talked!" another sighed.

'Member that one he got off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night Frank Hesbern come in? Hesbern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted an empty bottle, an' Cock Eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said afterwards what Hesbern needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a nipple on to it; yes, sir, that's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said! My golly, but the way he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was comical. No sir! Long's I live</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll never forget it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, boys!

He was a little fat squire from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yorkshire, and knew nothing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of war, except to obey orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There must be no.wavering, he told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">troop captains; no retreat. The attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be rushed through to the finish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He completed his stern instructions by</seg><seg type="columnLine">quoting Napoleon--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Guard dies but never surrenders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a moment he added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will lead the first troop. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">will follow in echelon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The troop captains, all fresh faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Irishmen, saluted, and answered:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We understand, sir. It is an attack to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one fair haired officer, bolder than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest, protested--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me, sir; we can not spare you</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in front."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To hell with regulations!" the colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded. "I don't push my men from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear. I get up front and pull them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He understood the tremendous impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of stopping the German advance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if only for an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   So the little fat colonel from Yorkshire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> who knew nothing about war mounted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his big black charger, the Dublin Sabers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> settled into their saddles and the historic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> charge began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a memorable charge. Three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards from the enemy line the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fat little colonel toppled from his horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The regiment swept on, slashing and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shooting their way through two regiments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Bavarians in spite of the murderous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machine gun fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Turning, they slashed and shot their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> way back, pausing to pick up their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The regiment went up six hundred and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sixty strong. It rode back with two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hundred and twenty-one men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But the enemy advance was checked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The R.

There he was laid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out with his saber beside him, and the two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hundred and twenty-one men of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> broken regiment passed through the tent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to take their last view of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Some of them merely touched his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others stooped to kiss his forehead. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> few knelt for a moment and sent up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a silent prayer for the repose of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   All of which was somewhat strange, be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cause the troopers were south Ireland</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> men, and the colonel was Church of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> England--a game little Yorkshire gentle-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> man who knew nothing about war except</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> how to die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">135</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghe</seg><seg type="columnLine">^Thraldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of</seg><seg type="columnLine">SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">PROLOGUE</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT MAY be no particular consolation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a man who is down and out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflect that he has no one to blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">but himself, though it's a sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he will blame the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charles Cartwright confined his abuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that particular part of the globe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies between Suez and Yokohama, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereafter accepted the occasion with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">philosophy of a young man who takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">things as they come. It was not the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in his life that he had found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a job, with his capital reduced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one dollar Mex, and no immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seated on the Singapore waterfront,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplating the lights of the ships at</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor in the roads and the tropic star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light mirrored on the black, oily water of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the harbor north of Blakan Mati Island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reviewed, with neither embitterment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intolerance nor any degree of satisfaction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thirty-one years of adventurous, mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the ten years he had been in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East he had tried his hand at rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">planting, tin mining and brokering, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he looked as if he were becoming a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beachcomber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To attempt to find excuses for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">would amount to a kind of moral coward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice--and Cartwright was not that sort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Novelette</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malay Peninsula</seg><seg type="columnLine">By CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">He preferred to look facts in the face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ordinary poor devil who went under</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tropics was either an inveterate</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler or an unreformed drunkard; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was neither, just a first class, special</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool--one of those people who possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">what may be called a genius for irrespon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility, who work and live, drink, laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make love, with never a thought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden, his introspective medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tations were disturbed by something very</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a broken sob. For a moment he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled, for he had believed himself to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. The seat upon which he sat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm shaded praya was backed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clump of shrubs; and he had not noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, on the other side of these shrubs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another and a similar seat. The one</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the shipping and the sea; the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deserted cricket ground, beyond which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the lighted windows of the Singapore</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotels, clubs and cafes, from the Hotel de</seg><seg type="columnLine">l'Europe to Raffles'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now, there are men--God save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark--who speak like women, and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the voices of men; but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never a man and a woman who wept alike.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was a woman's sob and, though soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was pitched on a plaintive, vibrant note,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made Cartwright sit bolt upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forget for the moment his own worries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and troubles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A woman undoubtedly. And, if so, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg><seg type="columnLine">138</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tamil or Malay. Tamil women wept for</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, though their oily, unfaithful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talkative husbands usually took good</seg><seg type="columnLine">care they had something to cry about. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated Tamils, as much as he liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malays; but he knew how to handle their</seg><seg type="columnLine">womenfolk. Indeed, life on a jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate consisted as much of settling family</seg><seg type="columnLine">disputes as tapping rubber or weeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">lalang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would put her right in two shakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her to send her husband to the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hit the other lady over the head with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empty gin bottle that had doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">started the trouble. It would give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to do. And besides, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're at the end of your tether, it's en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraging to be told--even by a long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired, weeping Asiatic, black as sin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all grease except her earrings--that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are her father and mother, that the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your countenance eclipses the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got to his feet, stepped off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paved esplanade on to the stiff "kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass" under a traveler's palm and beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the woman of his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A WHITE woman! Indeed, the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looked up at him in startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">- surprise was the whitest face that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ever seen, for it caught the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and the lights from the street lamps</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite, and it was powdered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black eyes and scarlet lips; and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloured shawl that half concealed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short skirted evening dress that sparkled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A slim little woman, beautiful, graceful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dejected, wearing silly satin shoes for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dewy grass, her black hair shingled--'-and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that white, powdered face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon," he stammered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought perhaps I might be of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he felt an unutterable fool, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing either presumptuous or insinuat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the tones of his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She just stared at him. As for Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright, he felt he had to explain things, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out who she was, what she was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. It occurred to him that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen pictures like her, but never anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">real.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," he went on, "I heard you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I thought you were crying. I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to find a native woman; and being</seg><seg type="columnLine">darned miserable myself, I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to put her right. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather like children, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this illuminating statement, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a full stop, observing that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet taken her eyes from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You speak French?" she asked, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly foreign accent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm wise enough not to try," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My vocabulary consists of Tamil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malay, a choice collection of Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear words and a few Latin tags.

As often as not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it only makes matters worse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can be worse," she asked, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such spirit as to be almost vehement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"than to be tied to a man you fear and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">life you hate, to see the father you love</seg><seg type="columnLine">being slowly poisoned in both body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, to know that there can never be any</seg><seg type="columnLine">release, except through death itself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A startling announcement for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered lady in an evening dress on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pray a in Singapore!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're in a worse way than I," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm only stone broke--out of a job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She regarded him critically, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked approval. She beheld a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking young Hercules in the crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit of white ducks. The open collar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">both shirt and coat displayed a bare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscular neck; a somewhat battered solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">topee perched well on the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. He stood awkwardly in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, with legs parted, a fist in one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouser pockets grasping his only dollar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave a little shrug of the shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew her shawl closer around her slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">little body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do not know why I should tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my private affairs," she said. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid you caught me in a weak moment."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Though I've not the remotest idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg><seg type="columnLine">who you are," said he, "you may depend</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, you can trust me.

Opening a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handbag that lay upon the seat beside her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she took out a small gold cigaret case and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit a cigaret. Cartwright remained stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, interested, almost fascinated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, for some reason or other, nervous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does one good to talk," she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked. "Tell me about yourself. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought not to be out of work.

At least, I've done more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that than anything else.

So I can't exactly ask that firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a letter of recommendation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sat thinking a moment, smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cigaret, gazing at the passing rick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaws under the street lamps beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cricket ground.

Naturally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will not say that you have talked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Au revoir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that she was off, across the wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass in her satin shoes. And from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment Charles Cartwright went out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world for fourteen months, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned up at the Nolak Estate on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yalai River, he looked like a man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just come out of hell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON THE YALAI RIVER</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LITTLE, flat bottomed, tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">kettle of a paddle-boat was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">La Chauve-Souris, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only three passengers on board, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no accommodation for more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">and because Nolak was just about the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">place on earth where any one would want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of these three, John Eade, wool mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant of New York and Melbourne, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one; and of the other two, the first was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little French lady, and the second, a fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, short of both sight and breath, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could never have been anything else but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">German.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the offices of an old established firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of New York solicitors it had been sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested that Eade should go himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malaya in search of a more or less dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputable younger cousin who, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">inherited a moderate fortune for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third time in his life, was nowhere to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From certain rubber estates in both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perak and Johore, a tin dredging company</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Singora, from even a poste-restante ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress in Pulo Penang, it was not possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn anything of Charles Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright's whereabouts. He was believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have left the Malay Peninsula alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, since he had been neither seen nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of for months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade, who had undertaken to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young reprobate if he could, was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonally interested in the'winding up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a maiden aunt's'estate, and as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to Melbourne in any case, had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to take in Singapore en route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had never been any real harm in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles. Eade remembered him well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy at college. Strong, good looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a fine athlete, Cartwright had suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps from overpopularity. He had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways been too ready to make both friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enemies. A rowdy young devil, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never cared two straws whether he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent his money or used his fists--the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">type to prefer a precarious, happy-go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky existence, knocking around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, to anything in the way of a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventional, settled life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And from all accounts, he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">things hum in the Malay States, before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had a free fight with his boss on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunchor Rubber Estate in Perak. A day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so after that incident, Charles had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an appearance at Ikey's Bar in Sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">apore, where he had stood drinks all</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. And that was the last that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been heard of him. Suddenly and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accountably, he had just disappeared, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">men sometimes do in the East.</seg><seg type="columnLine">EADE was inclined to believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cousin was dead. In any case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he very much doubted whether he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ever get any news of him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, the very day he arrived in Singapore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard that the missing man was alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles had turned up about a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, looking pale and haggard, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been having a thin time of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one could say where he had been, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had been doing. For once in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life he kept his business to himself;</seg><seg type="columnLine">though all his friends remarked that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked an altered man. Anyway, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his usual luck, he dropped straight on to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new job, for, knowing nothing of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">aunt's death, he believed that he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dollar in the world. Nolak wasn't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of place any one would choose; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright, who was admitted to be one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the best men with natives in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, had been glad enough to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first chance that offered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Eade, having come a good two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles out of his way, he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might as well see the business through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His cousin had gone up-country to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most inaccessible places in all Malaya;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in Raffles' Hotel he ran across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">German rubber expert, of the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gottheimer, who had got a passage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolak on the Yalai, on board a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp paddle-boat that was owned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skippered by a Portuguese. This Port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uguese, a Feriiao Quental, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pottering about the islands for years, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had long been suspected of having a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal interest in the smuggling carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Chinese and Japanese. He was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly little fellow, this Quental, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">parchment colored face and no hair, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of the glorified ferryboat he owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if it were a man-o'-war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gottheimer and Eade went aboard at</seg><seg type="columnLine">midday; and an hour or so afterward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady herself turned up. She had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg><seg type="columnLine">met Quental before, for she took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese by an arm and marched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight off to the poop, apparently to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of earshot of both Eade and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There the two talked for some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental gesticulating excitedly. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly ordered his lascar serang to pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">his odds and ends of a crew on deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled up to the bridge and got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet under way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was something of a surprise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">both Eade and the worthy Gottheimer;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Quental had just sworn, by all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saints he didn't believe in, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't weigh anchor until nearly sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, to clear the roads before dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade didn't much mind. So far as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see, they could do no worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">run aground. He supposed he would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Nolak somehow, and that there he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find his cousin, Charles. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">more immediately interested him was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady passenger, who hadn't come out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cabin all day long. From the glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had'got of her when she had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripping up the gangway, John L. Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">had more than liked the looks of her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fascinating little bit of goods, and none</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less so because he had never expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come across anything at all like her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of a tropic forest. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain he had found out her name, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was either married or a widow--</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out just enough to make him in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisitive. But apart from her prettiness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the attraction of a mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her, since for some reason or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little Portuguese was risking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety of his ship on her account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade sounded Gottheimer who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been up the river before and who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent the entire day in a deck chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking cheroots, cursing the climate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking beer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There would be dinner at six-thirty, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared, at which Quental would act as</seg><seg type="columnLine">host. The Chauve-Souris was a hell-boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because there was no ice on board.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolak was a fever trap at the Back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond and, were it not for rubber, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been forgotten long since by Gott</seg><seg type="columnLine">and never by man discovered. The lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger at dinner might appear--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not say. In the East he didn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">any particular interest in white girls; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred Japanese, Javanese or Burmese.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Herr Gottheimer, enlivened by pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">India ale, expressed his views with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction than delicacy. As he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never heard of any one attempting to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the Yalai by night, he would be sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised if before morning they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipwrecked and eaten by crocodiles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in any case, he repeated, the Chauve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Souris was a hell-boat, and the Yalai an</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly Styx.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade, who had no use for this sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, strolled toward the little saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lay aft, across a shallow well-deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the engine room and the poop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS rapidly growing dark--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift sunset of the tropics. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen of the sky above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treetops was a blurred streak of reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown; and the air, alive with insects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a wet blanket, heavy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffocating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade entered the saloon, where a lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning and a Chinese boy was lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the table for dinner, in which task</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was being helped by the lady passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was dressed in a Japanese kimono;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in that light Eade thought she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked even prettier than before. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to the boy in Chinese; and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablecloth was not as clean as it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been, she was insisting upon having</seg><seg type="columnLine">another one. When Eade walked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon, she looked up and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is how men keep house!" she ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served, with her fascinating French</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent, and just the suspicion of a lisp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Were it not for women, I think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would all become savages again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade liked the way she said that, quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart from the fact that he thought there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be some truth in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At any rate," he answered, "we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate the niceties of life, if some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times we don't bother about them. Can I</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of any assistance?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">142</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything is finished," she declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The boy understands. Dinner will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready in five minutes. It is already late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have not yet dressed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That knocked the courtier out of John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade, wool merchant. In a tramp</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle-boat, on an out-of-the-way Malay</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, when they might run aground at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment, she proposed to dress for</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner! He wondered whether he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">rake out something in the way of a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie and dinner clothes. As he had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes to spare, he would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dived into his cabin, hurled the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents of his box all over the place and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling into a stiff collar when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese steward let fly at a gong as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scaring devils. A few minutes later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade turned up in the saloon to find Herr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gottheimer and Madame Scala, dining</seg><seg type="columnLine">tete-a-tete, the captain not having ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured to leave the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame might have been in a restau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant on the Rue Royale. She bowed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval of the American's compliment</seg><seg type="columnLine">to herself; and Gottheimer, who was wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a much creased pongee suit, expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his disgust by a succession of grunts into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soup plate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meal passed pleasantly enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade. Madame, who was as charming as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked, had plenty to say for herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From time to time Gottheimer, who sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite her, gazed at her in a bovine</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner over the top of his spectacles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went on with his food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So Charles Cartwright is your cousin,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she observed, after it had taken her about</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes to find out all about Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, do you know him?" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," she laughed, a little nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, he thought. "We are--friends. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, I go to Nolak especially to see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade inwardly cursed his cousin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then did some rapid thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what's the hurry?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She half turned toward him and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him straight in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there a hurry?" she asked. "I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly thought there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">something urgent," he stammered. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">little dago captain gave out that he sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't navigate this river in the dark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	though it was you who made him change</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed again at that, though a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal of her self-assurance seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have deserted her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That should be my privilege," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "But Quental is no fool. He knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">his business. You may be sure we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach Nolak soon after midnight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad to hear it," said the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Herr Gottheimer had doubts about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had hoped to draw the German into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conversation; but the worthy Gott-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heimer wasn't taking any. He looked up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted, and then went on cutting a pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">apple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Madame Scala touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade upon an arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me," she said. "When we get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolak, you will sleep on board?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said he. "Time enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look up my cousin in the morning."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MOMENT after, complaining of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat, she suggested that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should go on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then and there, outside the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the saloon, she admitted that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not told him the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fernao Quental just does what I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him," she observed. "Charles Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright's life is worth a great deal more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the little Chauve-Souris. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not admit that in front of Herr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gottheimer, who did not seem to approve</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She led the way up the steps to the poop</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there was an iron seat clamped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck. Here she sat down, inviting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade to join her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is plenty of room," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And it is cooler here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last of the daylight still lingered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west--a dull, burning streak above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treetops of the jungle. The flickering</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of a hurricane-lamp fell upon a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, immediately in front of them, sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">143</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended from davits. They could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else. The Chauve-Souris was</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling at less than half speed, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines rattling like a hundred tin cans</seg><seg type="columnLine">being dragged over stony ground. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be gliding through the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a man swims under water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madame had given John Eade some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to think about. This little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered lady, to all intents and pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses, was master of the ship. So his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin's life was in danger. And she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to Nolak especially to see Charles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looked like a love affair. Eade was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what's up with Charles?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "From all accounts he has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost for months. Where has he been to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who wants to do him in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can not tell you," she answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps you will be told everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we reach our destination."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we ever do," said Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course we shall get there," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "Little Quental is himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge, and he can see in the dark like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild cat. He is used to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Gottheimer says we haven't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog's chance," said the American.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's no moon until late at night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks we'll run aground before that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if we do, it looks like a bad business</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Cousin Charles, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you," she said emphatically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quental can see in the dark. He has run</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ship into worse rivers than this be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore now, and with no lights. Indeed, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one time that was his business. I tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in confidence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the same," insisted Eade, "if my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin's life's actually in danger, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, it will be a serious thing if we do</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to grief?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a boat," she said. "I expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know how to row, and Herr Gott-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heimer, too, if he wishes. We can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be many miles from Nolak as it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I know anything of discipline on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board a packet like this," suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American, "there's likely to be a panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">about nothing. It's ten to one there're</seg><seg type="columnLine">no oars in the boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could just see enough of her white</seg><seg type="columnLine">face in the lantern light to realize that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last he had struck home. She looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuinely alarmed, and there was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch in her breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is perhaps possible," she ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted. "Could you manage to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything is all right? It would be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible if I do not get to Nolak tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There should be no great difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that," said Eade. "I can catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of the gunwale of the boat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb up the rails. But I shall want the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern. It's dark as pitch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He unhooked the lantern which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended at the end of a little deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">storehouse--the worst place in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which to keep provisions in a tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. Eade, who was a tall man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no need to climb to the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taffrails to look into the boat. But no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner had he done so than he sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward to the deck; while something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might have been a human panther</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighted almost noiselessly by the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT TOOK him a moment to recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">both his surprise and his balance, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing patent leather shoes, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly slipped and fallen. And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aware of the fact that a man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in front of him, but a few inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">away--a man who had been hiding in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who the hell are you?" he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising the lantern which had fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept alight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped back at once--a short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick step--and clenched his fist. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, had disclosed a tall, good looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese, with the pale, lemon colored face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Cantonese, very black eyes and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high though slightly receding forehead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wearing a pair of white duck</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers and a flannel shirt completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">open in front, disclosing smooth, shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinese made no attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. He glanced rapidly, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of a hunted thing, from Eade to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Scala, and then for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to consider the advisability of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping overboard. From the lady there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a shriek, not loud, but half sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed and tremulous, which, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested the utmost dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mon Dieul" she cried. "Liu Tang!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le diable! Oh, que faire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that the Chinese turned to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it; and as he did so, John Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew at him like a dog, and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HELL-BOAT</seg><seg type="columnLine">EADE soon found out that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on more than he had bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained for. Though the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not as tall as himself, and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like so heavy, he was a strong man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slippery as an eel; and during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brief struggle he did his best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get at a naked knife he carried at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was by no means an unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for the American that Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala's cry of alarm had the effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing the little Portuguese captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the bridge like a terrier after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rat. Eade had put down the hurricane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp, and this gave Quental all the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">he needed. While passing down the deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain had armed himself with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">belaying pin, and with this he dealt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese a blow on the head that knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him completely out, and very nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade was glad enough to extricate him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with no greater damage done than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled shirt; for Quental, wild with</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, and shouting at the top of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice in his own language, had laid about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him right and left, and it was more by</seg><seg type="columnLine">good luck than good management that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not floored Eade as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The American got to his feet, shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself like a wet dog and then stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">madame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood in a tense attitude, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clasped in front of her, her face--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in that dim light--looking whiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever. He could see that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling, as if it were only with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest effort that she was able to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so you know this man?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She seemed not to have heard the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, until she gave a little start and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly turned to Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might have know it," she said, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking to herself. "Liu Tang was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain to have followed me. But how</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he come on board?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must have climbed on deck last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night,*' said the other. "He has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding in that boat for nearly twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours, under the tarpaulin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't mean that," she answered. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not think how he got to Singapore in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you know where he came from?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Helasl" she sighed. "I know that--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my cost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinaman lay upon the deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff and straight as a corpse. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a look upon his face that put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind up John Eade, who had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to figure in the Malay newspa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers as a witness at a trial for man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went down upon his knees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed an ear to the unconscious man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's alive, all right," said he, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh of relief. "But if he hasn't got con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion, the fellow must have a skull like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flatiron. What do you propose to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was to Quental that he spoke--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental, who was leaning right forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his elbows on his knees, staring into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immobile, waxen countenance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese. The expression of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese was extraordinary: he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">half frightened and half jubilant, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was panting like a man who has run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, his mouth wide open. He still held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belaying pin in his right hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be ready, even eager, to use it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, should his unfortunate victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">move so much as an inch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUDDEN crashing of branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, a kind of roar from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine room, accompanied by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">squelching noise as the paddleblades</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrashed heavily into thick, slimy mud--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a shock that shook the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from stem to stern and hurled the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, Eade and Madame Scala to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A moment afterward Quental was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting like a maniac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My ship!" he cried. "Finish! One</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn' serang. Him I leave on the bridge;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now I am ruined--finish!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that he lapsed into his own lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage, a string of exclamations and oaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to Eade to be all one inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minable word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man seemed to have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">raving mad. He danced upon the deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He slobbered at the mouth. And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up the belaying pin which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen fron his hand, he rushed forward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he would again strike the unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese. Indeed, it is possible he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done so, had not the American inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is his fault!" Quental gibbered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting his words out with difficulty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling his eyes. "This damn' Liu Tang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	tell you, yes!" *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, upon a sudden, he remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his proper place was on the bridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there might yet be a chance of get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the boat clear of the mud into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this time she had been ramming her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose like an old sow at a heap of garbage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still shouting at the top of his voice, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened forward, leaving his two passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers alone with the senseless man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so the worst has happened," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade, as calmly as he could. "Though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may not have been the captain's fault,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, madame, is what we feared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood motionless, biting her painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some way must be found," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps Quental will be able to put mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters right. He knows I must get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nolak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she brought her right hand to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">left shoulder, and Eade saw her wince.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have hurt yourself!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A bruise," she answered. "When 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, I think, I hit the end of the iron seat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that is nothing," she went on. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment, the worthy German</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared on deck, rolling in his gait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he had gained the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder, the light from the lantern caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spectacles and made them look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">little headlights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did I not this bredict?" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have I not said to dravel by night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foolishness?

"Madame is hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She may even have broken her collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gottheimer's eyes revolved slowly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the little French lady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Der gollar bone!" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is der glavicle.

In his own language, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his breath, he went off,with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady, abusing Quental in particular and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole Portuguese nation in general.</seg><seg type="columnLine">EADE found himself left alone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unconscious Chinese. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the captain shouting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, the engines roaring and straining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paddle blades lashing and churning</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep into the mud. Nothing much could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen, yet Eade was conscious that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of trees overhung the deck, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattans were tangled in the rigging; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere was foul with the stench of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud brought to the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the Chinese moved, rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head slowly from one side to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then with some difficulty lifted him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self upon his elbows, staring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade knelt down by his side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">146</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you speak English?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then perhaps you'll answer my ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions now. Where do you come froiri?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what are you doing on board this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship? You had best speak the truth!'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinese's eyes narrowed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merest slits, though he never shifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze. He was certainly a handsome fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, though far from pleasant looking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked as if he had about as much pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and human sympathy in his composition</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a cobra. He replied in almost perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you nothing until I know who</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are," said he. "Why should I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a cool customer, anyway," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade. "I'm a passenger on board this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, if you want to know--and that's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will know. You seem to have for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten that you're a stowaway, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand what that means."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other laughed--not as a white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughs, just a curl of his thin lips and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of snarl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I wanted to," said he, "I could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a first class passage from here to Frisco.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I travel I please myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade was getting interested. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to find out more about this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary man,'who was certainly no</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolie, but a well educated, high class</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese. Liu Tang, however, knew how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep his own counsel; and it is open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">question whether Eade would have dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered anything more about him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, even if Quental had not then re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the poop, accompanied by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lascar serang--a gray bearded, barefoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaman from the Malabar coast, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance as brown and wrinkled as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">walnut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Quental saw that Liu Tang was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting up, he stepped back quickly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let out an oath, in a breathless, frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Liu Tang, it's queets now, see?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "I pay you back, yes. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come aboard my ship without passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. I put you in irons, savvy? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta the law my side, Liu Tang. Hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, or I shoot you, presto!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, he produced from out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coat pocket a huge revolver, the big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest Eade had ever seen in his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether or not the little Portuguese was</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of using it to any good effect was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another question, for the American ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served that Quental's hand was trembling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and though his words were brave enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a distinct quaver in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinese, on the other hand, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded the captain with the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorn. In the lamplight his features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen to assume a sneer in which there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much amusement as contempt. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, he did what he was told,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was only with the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty that he succeeded in holding up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drawing himself into an upright posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, still sitting on the deck, he swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly from side to side, as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still dizzy. Quental, with his revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled at Liu Tang, gave orders to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serang who, with the deft hands of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor, quickly knotted the two wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">together after he had lowered both arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the Chinese's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you queeck march," said Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal. "You gotta get up, or I shoot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lock you up in a safe place, Liu Tang. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta the law; you not forget that. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">queeck settle a Chinese stowaway. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">not do what I say, and I punch a hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">right through your stomach, savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AGAIN EADE feared for the China-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's life; for Quental was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously frightened that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might let off the gun by mistake at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. For the time being, most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade's sympathy was on the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunate Liu Tang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold hard a bit!" he intervened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The fellow can't get up. Guess he's half</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep still, and his head sings like a kettle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you want to lock the poor devil up, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose you're within your rights; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him a chance, Captain. You can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit a man when he's down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give him chance!" Quental almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed. "That yellow devil! Much</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance he give me. I gotta him now; you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no mistake, mister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disregarding the Portuguese, and rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lizing that his own life was in no little</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, Eade placed his forearms under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chinese's armpits and lifted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a standing position. And even then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang staggered like a drunken man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he had Eade on one side of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the serang upon the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They led him to a small cubbyhole</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside the cook's galley. The place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unlighted and unventilated, and half</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with all sorts of odds and ends such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as coils of rope, paint pots and brushes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oilcans, brooms and holystones. Quental</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed the Chinese over the threshold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slammed the door, locked it and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key in his pocket. Then he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">round at Eade and grinned, showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow, dirty teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gotta him!" he repeated. "Mister,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one good night's work, yes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And what about the ship?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade. "Are we here for good? Will we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a tug to pull us off, or can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage it yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact that the engines had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent for some minutes had made Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that perhaps Gottheimer was right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they would never get up to Nolak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental shrugged his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much dark now," said he. "The mast</seg><seg type="columnLine">has fouled the trees, mister. Bimeby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when daylight come I think we got off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tide up then and that make plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference. You trust me, mister. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not want lose my ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said the other, "and are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to leave that fellow in there all</seg><seg type="columnLine">night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More safer place for him," said Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal. "You not know him, mister, same</seg><seg type="columnLine">like me. Best thing for you, you go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. No one come up this river. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta wait."</seg><seg type="columnLine">AS IT WAS still quite early, Eade had</seg><seg type="columnLine">/-\ no desire to turn in. He went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the main deck and lit a cigar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was there joined after a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">by both Madame Scala and Gottheimer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who announced that there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with the lady's shoulder be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond a severe contusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three talked for a while on general</seg><seg type="columnLine">topics, Gottheimer becoming almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiable. And then Madame Scala de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared that she had no intention of sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing anywhere but on deck, as below there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a breath of air to breathe. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, she had already given orders to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese steward to bring up her mattress</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blankets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Gottheimer refused to follow her</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, saying that he would rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep in an oven than be eaten alive by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosquitoes--John Eade was left in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">predicament. He knew that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never get a wink of sleep in his cabin;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, on the other hand, his inexperience</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the East led him to think that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to consider the proprieties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When Madame Scala went below to</seg><seg type="columnLine">undress, Eade decided to make the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the few minutes that were left to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finish his cigar on the poop, wh'ch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being well out toward midstream, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the coolest part of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There the hurricane lamp was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning where he himself had placed it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck; and there, too, lay the curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife that had dropped from Liu Tang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand when Quental knocked him down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade picked up that knife and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It was a murderous looking weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a long thin blade and sharp as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crew seemed to have turned in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental had himself disappeared, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably into his cabin. Eade threw the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, the sharp point sticking in the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">teak boards, the ivory handle vibrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a tuning fork. That made him thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stars that he had managed to hang on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Chinese during their struggle. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang had got a hand free with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, it would have been all up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down on the iron seat where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sat with Madame Scala, and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think the matter out. He wondered who</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil this Liu Tang was. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently come on board the Chauve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">Souris with a definite purpose; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose of a man who carried a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that was not likely to be philan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thropic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anyway, both the Portuguese captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the little French lady knew very Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">who he was--though they preferred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep their knowledge to themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade got to his feet and stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. The mosquitoes were singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his ears, though the smoke of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar kept them at a safe distance. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow, whether or not Quental suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in getting the boat off the mud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would make it his business to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything he could. And, if they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell him nothing, he would make in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiries at Nolak. It was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely that his cousin, Charles Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright, would be able to clear things up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that reflection, and remembering</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the lady proposed to monopolize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck for the night, he resolved to turn in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at the foot of the steps on the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well deck, he came face to face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">madame herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was dressed in pajamas of dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk, and was smoking a cigaret in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">holder, and in her right hand she carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">an electric torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinese steward came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness behind her like a ghostly, shape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less bundle. He was loaded up with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattress and blankets; and little of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was visible, except the ends of his white</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggy trousers and his soft felt shoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not afraid of the mosquitoes?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade asked her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no," she smiled. "I am used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Like human beings, they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">their preferences. And, besides, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes a time when one is almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mune. I have lived in the East too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tripped up the few steps that led to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poop, where Eade heard her giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">her instructions to the boy as to exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was to spread her mattress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, suddenly, he remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife that he had left on the deck. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noticed that she had nothing on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet but a pair of silk bedroom slippers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which the sharp blade of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodthirsty weapon would slice like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out for that Chinaman's knife!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried. "I left it up there. I ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken it away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came to the rails above the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck and looked down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all right," she laughed. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found it and put it on the seat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental tells me that Liu Tang is safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">under lock and key. That is well--well</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us all--and your cousin, Charles," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">added. "Sleep well, my good American.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will find it hot in your cabin. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are wise, you also will come on deck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Tell me," he asked, "aren't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened to sleep there--almost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not fear the jungle," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do not think that I am nervous because</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was afraid of Liu Tang. "</seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE DISAPPEARED, and Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and walked amidships. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the bridge there was a light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain's cabin; and looking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the porthole which gave upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main deck, he could see Quental stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon his bunk, wearing a suit of very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty pajamas, uncovered by either</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket or sheet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If John Eade was going to get at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, why not now? Why shouldn't he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake the man up and insist upon knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Quental had risked his ship, why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wanted to kill Liu Tang, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang was? Eade was dead sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow or other his cousin was mixed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this affair. And, besides, the Portu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guese was interfering with the liberty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a citizen of the United States. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't put a patron to great personal in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenience and refuse to give a reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade tried the door, and found it both</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked and bolted on the inner side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seizing the handle with both hands, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook it violently, using all his strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping that the noise would wake the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he went back to the porthole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the reason why Quental would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake up. The man lay with his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and his mouth wide open. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time he noticed a sharp, pungent</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell that issued through the porthole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, lying on the floor in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">berth, he saw an ivory opium pipe. Upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little table at the bedside was a china</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl in which was a kind of skewer and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small spirit lamp that was still alight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess he thought he wanted some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to calm his nerves," said John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade to himself. "I thought he was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opium smoker the moment I saw him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Darned fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that reflection he went below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no one to be seen on deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even a night watch. The serang, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had apparently turned in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found the heat in his cabin almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">insufferable--a kind of wet heat that</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused a man to perspire, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never moved a little finger. The prox-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imity of the engine room made matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse, though the atmosphere of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself was like that of a vapor bath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The cabin porthole was open when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade undressed. He could see nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">without, though he was conscious that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets and undergrowth of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tangled and massed against the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the ship. He could hear noises,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, continuous and, to him, more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable: the ceaseless droning of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, movements in the water, the stir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring of animals in the tree-tops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put out the oil lamp which tended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the room even hotter than it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for more than an hour tried in vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get to sleep. The situation was novel</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to his experience, quite apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the heat. The little ship on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found himself was a kind of floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery: an opium drugged captain; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little French woman, painted, fascinating</seg><seg type="columnLine">and playing some deep game of her own;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally, a murderous Chinese, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the features of Milton's Satan and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manners of a cultured man, who had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board as a stowaway!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had made neither head nor tail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing when he drifted into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of semi-conscious condition that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither sleep nor wakefulness. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that he tossed continually from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side of his bunk to the other, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">oncq or twice he groaned aloud, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably swore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were brief intervals, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he actually did sleep; and from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these intermittent dozes he awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a start, springing from his berth, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find himself standing trembling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the little cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a crash in the jungle outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porthole, a crash followed by a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">smothered, guttural exclamation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been an oath. He heard bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet running lightly, swiftly, on the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him. And then, other sounds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle--the breaking of a rotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch, a splash in the water, and lastly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a momentary flash, like some gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">will-o'-the-wisp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN EADE didn't know why he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling. He had an idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something terrible had happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might have seemed terrible only</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it had got mixed up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in his dreams--something he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't remember. It took him a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to realize that he wasn't wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake; and then, for a few seconds, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inclined to believe that everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been only imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood listening, and could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. The jungle was silent now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for the insects. He could hear no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one moving anywhere on board. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound but the throbbing of the running</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fumbling, he found a box of matches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lit the lamp. Then he thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had best look over the ship, to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was all right. He felt ill at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease; and a breath of air, at any rate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do him good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily putting on a pair of slippers, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his cabin, and passed along the alley-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way by the engine room to the after well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. There was a sort of moon now, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred light in the sky behind the mist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as his eyes had grown accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">150</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the darkness he could make out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark trees of the jungle. The hurricane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp was still burning on the poop, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Scala--he presumed--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep.	*	j</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And then, he saw something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned him that she couldn't be asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From where he stood he could just see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poop deck, upon which two blankets lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide apart and well away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattress, as if they had been cast hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was up the steps like a streak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning. There was no sign of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman there, though he looked every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where with the help of the lantern. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only was she gone, but Liu Tang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife had also disappeared from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Scala had said she had put it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the iron seat aft of the deckhouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Something was wrong--perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy had taken place! He must report</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once to Quental. Even then, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried for'ard, it occurred to him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chinese might have escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came breathless to the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin; in it there was still a light. As be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, he looked in through the porthole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there Fernao Quental lay in much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same attitude as before. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen a little further back; his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was even more wide open, and one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms hung over the edge of the bunk, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand touching the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drugged senseless! Oblivious to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of sentient things. Dreaming, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, in blissful inconsequence and confu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. That much, at least, was sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted by the expression on his face--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips drawn back upon the teeth, lines at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corners of the eyes. He was like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would laugh aloud, had laughed not</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded a certain physical effort that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond him. A voluptuary who re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed in some Garden of Armida of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own conception, or who floated upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings of down through space, like Helios</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his golden boat--and there above him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not an inch from his head, driven deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the woodwork of the cabin, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming blade of a knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade knew that knife at a glance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the ivory handle. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been hurled through the porthole</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terrific force, for the sharp point was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch deep in the wood; and the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">had missed Quental's skull by the breadth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a little finger. While the man's sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious self drifted through an under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of intangible delights, his physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had tottered and quavered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very brink of the grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade drew back, conscious of alarm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unanswerable questions revolving in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain like changing colors before the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man who has stared at too bright a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Where was Madame Scala? Dead?</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the river--to be dragged from the mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the crocodiles?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He still had the hurricane-lamp that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought with him from the poop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pulling himself together with an effort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went down the companionway to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook's galley, to the little cubbyhole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had seen Quental lock up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese, Liu Tang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, the door was open. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't expected anything else. The lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been picked with a stiff piece of wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Chinese had not even troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remove from the keyhole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Eade stood half dazed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found it difficult to think. Somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered Gottheimer's phrase; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come on board a "hell-boat." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming heat, the surrounding im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable darkness, the very silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">punctuated by spasmodic, metallic groan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings from the engine room--all served to</seg><seg type="columnLine">foster the illusion. He was stranded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Styx.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">QUENTAL BECOMES CONFIDENTIAL</seg><seg type="columnLine">EADE'S thoughts flew back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Scala. He remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fear of the Chinese, her pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pable and abject terror when she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first seen the man, who for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">during that night had been at large on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board the Chauve-Souris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If, dead or alive, she were yet any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in the ship, she must be found.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">151</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow or other he must wake Quental,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was the only man on board who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In something not far from panic the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American returned to the deck and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">made frantic efforts to break into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain's cabin. Failing both in that and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in getting any sign of life out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugged, unconscious man, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted through the porthole at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his voice, he hastened for'ard. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked rapidly, without the least effort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though limbs felt heavy as lead--more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less as a man thinks he walks in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare. When he came to the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle he groped his way in the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nostrils offended by every conceivable</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell that ever came out of the East.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental's crew had been made up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lascars, Malays and Chinese. Here were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the composite odors of tar and opium, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten fish and ghee, of garlic and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration, mingled with human breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">scented with bctelnut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade struck his head against an iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">stanchion; and then, stumbling over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, saved himself from falling only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing a hand down violently upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greasy, naked chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an oath. At once the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Babel. Eade 'shouted in English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and although they couldn't understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, they recognized the language; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was that alone, perhaps, that saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from a knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When a lantern was lit, he saw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the serang, to whom he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to make himself intelligible, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lascar boatswain had served on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">a British ship plying between London and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bombay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come here," said he. "I want you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The man followed him to the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. He heard what had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">without emotion, though he nodded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head from time to time to let the Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can know that he understood. It took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade a long time to impress upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lascar the importance, even the necessity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of waking up the captain, and that with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With some reluctance the serang went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the forecastle, to return in less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a minute carrying an ax and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companied by several inquisitive mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers-of the crew. For all that, he dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not break down the door himself, but left</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One blow was enough to shatter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock and splinter the woodwork of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jamb. The noise caused Quental to sit up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half open his eyes. When Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the cabin, the captain looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a dazed, silly expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Eade caught the Portuguese by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulders and shook him so violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his head rocked backward and for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward on a limp, scraggy neck, rather like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a dead fowl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull yourself together, you darned</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool!" he cried. "Look at that knife, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that you're lucky to be alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than that, Madame Scala has</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished and that Chinaman has</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These three items of stupendous news</seg><seg type="columnLine">took time to filter into Quental's drugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sluggish brain. He stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife with an inane expression, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a kind of snigger, proving thereby</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even yet he failed to realize its</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade repeated what he had said, shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing word for word in the captain's ear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental now sitting up upon his bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his dirty, skinny feet upon the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Liu Tang!" he exclaimed at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Escaped! Mister, I think you make</seg><seg type="columnLine">joke, yes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had gone white in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade seized him by a wrist and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come and see for yourself," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll come to your senses all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you get the shock of your life."</seg><seg type="columnLine">FORCIBLY he dragged the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the deck of his own ship, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then pushed him stumbling down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the companionway. The exercise had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired effect: Quental began to regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of his limbs, his memory and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. When he saw the open door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubbyhole, it was as if he had received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent blow in the pit of the stomach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he gasped and leaned back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the alleyway, breathing heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He mumbled a few words in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">language--oaths, probably--or invoca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to the saints. Then he realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have to be practical, that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing would have to be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madame!" he cried. "You say she</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I left her on the poop," said the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"where she said she was going to sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She isn't there now; and so far as I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see she's nowhere on board."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental, still leaning against the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to gnaw his fingernails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Liu Tang wouldn't kill her!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered. "Scala not let him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time Eade could not fail</seg><seg type="columnLine">to detect a want of confidence in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. The man was not so much stating</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fact, as asking himself a question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Quental flew into a temper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The vital part of him revived. Straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening himself, trembling all over, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped with his bare feet like a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempered child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your fault, mister!" he cried. "I kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang, if you no stop me. Now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta pay for it. Liu Tang not miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">another.time. Oh, mister, Fernao Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal and dead man--all same thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His rage was snuffed out of him like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a candle, and he was on the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blubbering, when Eade again seized him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try to be a man!" he cried, "or as</seg><seg type="columnLine">near to it as you can get. You're in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of this ship, aren't you? Well, get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a move on! Have the boat searched from</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem to stern. For all you or I know, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady may still be somewhere on board.</seg><seg type="columnLine">YotF don't even know that that China-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man himself isn't hiding somewhere."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That startled Quental again; but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment after, he slowly shook his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half despondent, half relieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn' sure thing him go," he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served.) "Liu Tang gone into jungle. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">madame dressed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pajamas," said Eade. "And silk slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers. Old Gottheimer wasn't far wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he called this thing a hell-boat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental climbed up the companionway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagging at the knees, as if all the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone out of him, half pulling himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by grasping the brass rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On deck he found the serang and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him his orders. The whole crew was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the main deck, several with lanterns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the light on their faces they looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange collection--every cast of counte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nance the Malay States can produce;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some evil, some fierce, many grinning, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the next five minutes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">systematic search was made from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end of the paddle-boat to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Even the engine room was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected. And then the serang returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the main deck, saluted and reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no trace of either the lady or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese could be found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental looked at Eade, his jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped, his eyes staring. As before, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thought was for his own safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mister," said he, in a hushed, tremu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous voice, "if we not getta the boat off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud, perhaps Liu Tang come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," said the American, "it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">about time I knew the truth.

You knew this Liu Tang</seg><seg type="columnLine">before ever he came on board this ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just you tell me where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Singan," said Quental, hanging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And where's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Island, mister," said the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Macassar Straits, 'tween Celebes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Borneo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And did Madame Scala come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain hesitated, shifting upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and again began to bite his finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" cried the American.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Speak out! Did Madame Scala come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this place, Singan?

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already found out more than he had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, and realized the advisability of</seg><seg type="columnLine">not appearing merely inquisitive. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments he considered possibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, tell me," he asked, "did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever come across a man in Singan of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of Charles Cartwright?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Course, mister," said the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That man the bottom of all the dam'</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble.

"Then he good as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man already." And then the recol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lection of his own narrow escape caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to shiver. "Thank God I locka my</seg><seg type="columnLine">door!" he exclaimed. "Lui Tang couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in my cabin. I think he gotta very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time to spare. That's why he make</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw the knife through porthole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who is this Liu Tang?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He do alia dirty jobs for Battista</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala," said Quental.

Eade went on with his question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "You spoke of a certain Bernard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Camus as being Madame Scala's</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. What's his business on this out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way island?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental held up a dirty thumb, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then pointed it downward to the deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the manner of a spectator in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roman amphitheater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Scala gotta Le Camus just like that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he. "Yes, mister. Old man can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. They drugga him; all time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoka opium. He's frightened of Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">same like everybody else. Battista</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala ver' handsome, ver' strong, big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.

That's why Liu Tang</seg><seg type="columnLine">come after her and Cartwright."</seg><seg type="columnLine">EADE sighed. On the face of things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it looked as if he would never set</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his cousin alive. At any rate, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything could be done to save Charles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no time to waste; it was a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure thing that the Chinese had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard into the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Captain Quental," said he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm much obliged to you for your con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence.

I came out here specially to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I no think you will," said the Portu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guese, with a degree of finality that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a little disconcerting.

"I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to go up the river and can start at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. I can kill two birds with one stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so to speak--warn my cousin that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life's in danger and get whatever help I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental thought for a moment. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">some extent he had regained his presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind, but he still greatly agitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never for long could he go without biting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nails, and he kept glancing nervously</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one side to the other, as if he sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected that some one might spring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at any moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You getta upstream in boat, mister.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I give you two good men to row. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't miss Nolak--only few miles away."</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as he had given his orders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the serang he went back to his whining</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reproaches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I killa that dam' Chinaman if you not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop me, presto," he complained. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you finda your cousin with throat cut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your fault, mister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, dry up!" cried Eade, losing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience with the man. "How long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore daylight? If you lose no time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowering the boat, I might get to Nolak</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Liu Tang. At any rate there may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental shrugged his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boat alia ready, mister, soon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are," said he. "I think, ver' like I</seg><seg type="columnLine">getta the boat off the mud under her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam when the tide's up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me what you really think," asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade. "What's become of madame?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Looks like she's dead, mister. If she</seg><seg type="columnLine">try make the alarm, Liu Tang perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">killa her and throw body overboard."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade strode into the captain's cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, using all his strength, wrenched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife out of the wooden wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's no blood on this," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That make proof nothing," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental. "She cry out, Liu Tang catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold her throat, strangle her, presto.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Easy work--and ver' quick."</seg><seg type="columnLine">EADE shuddered as he went below</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his cabin. He had certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a splash in the water. Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">that have been Madame Scala's dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body? He couldn't believe that true--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little woman to whom he had talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at dinner but a few hours before, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather fascinated him. If this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East, he thanked God he didn't have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live in the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was sweating profusely as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled into his clothes. Before he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cabin he took the precaution of put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting a small automatic pistol into one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pockets and a handful of cartridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes later, he was swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the darkness up the river, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence disturbed only by the sweep of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars in the strong hands of two lascar</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made no attempt to steer. Seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stern, he held the rudder taut, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the boat in charge of the two oarsmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of whom glanced repeatedly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to side, whispering directions to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. There was a moon now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screened by a thick, watery mist; as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river narrowed, the branches of the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapang trees on both sides almost touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">To John Eade minutes seemed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. With the approach of dawn there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a cool damp breeze that caused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage in the jungle to rustle--an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny sound because it was indefinite and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet everywhere. The perspiration with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his shirt was saturated quite sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly became cold, and he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver, his teeth chattering, and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel his heartbeats racing and his throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry as sand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cartwright's bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE APPROACH of daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought John L. Eade to the reali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation of two very different facts--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superb beauty of the Malay jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the. circumstance that he had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted a chill. And strangely enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one seemed to be not altogether dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with the other. The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he knew himself to be feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed in some way to account for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exotic scenery, the profuse extravagance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and variety of the vegetation. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that he had never experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his life before, something altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from the American forests or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australian bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The prodigality of Nature almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened him. Looking upward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the density of the undergrowth almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the level of the water, he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle more amazing, even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage looking and impenetrable, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had seen it from the deck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauve-Souris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was something not real about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, something in keeping with his fevered</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood and quickening pulse. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lascars now looked neither to the right nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. With short, quick strokes they</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied their oars in unison, the sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping from beneath their faded blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbans, while they muttered, rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang, a haunting song, so monotonous in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its melody and so repetitious in its words</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to Eade it was like the persistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating of a tomtom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond a sharp, almost right-angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend, the river broadened out to more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than three times its former width; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, upon the left bank, was Nolak--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least enough evidence to prove to Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had reached his destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three bamboo jetties projected into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, between which were clustered</seg><seg type="columnLine">some score of native craft, river proas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes. As the boat drew nearer, two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three aitap thatched bungalows came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, standing upon high ground half</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared of trees, about a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the river bank. One of them stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon the skyline against the red of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn; with its floor raised about six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the ground, supported upon strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles, it looked like some quaint, gigantic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehistoric insect standing upright upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff, jointless legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the left of this was an open clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">across which ran a broad, well made road</seg><seg type="columnLine">of red gravel that ascended another hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ock, more or less devoid of vegetation</seg><seg type="columnLine">save for a few scattered palm trees, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath which were several barrack-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings constructed of wood and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched with palm leaves, all exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar in their dimensions, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged that they formed two lateral</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the same hillside were scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chickens and goats, while here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the huts native women and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren were to be seen, the former gossiping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in groups. These were women of all ages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in flowing, dirty robes that de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended from the left shoulder. The hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many hung down to below their</seg><seg type="columnLine">waists, and their skin was black as jet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the far side of the clearing, imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately facing the jetties, was a long low</seg><seg type="columnLine">building that was evidently a factory and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drying shed; and not far from this were</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two smaller and better built</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses that had the unmistakable ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of offices. Beyond the factory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two hillocks, one could ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain a glimpse of the gently rising ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">that marked a plantation of young rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, where a gang of coolies was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen at work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LASCARS ran the boat along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the central jetty, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping their oars, produced dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking bundles that contained a mixture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rice and fish, which they proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat by the primitive method of scooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into their mouths with their fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had fulfilled their part of the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. They were no longer concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ith John Eade. Having infinite respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the capacities of the white man, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways were not their ways, who was in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things incomprehensible, they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even curious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade climbed out of the boat, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rickety jetty creaking and swaying be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath his weight. He had not the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea where to go, but had little doubt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner or later he would come across</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one who could tell him where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">156</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find Charles Cartwright or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager of the estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three or four Tamil children, playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with empty coconut shells in a puddle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud, desisted from their game to stare at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in awed astonishment. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther on he came across a Chinese, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could give him no better information</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a "No savvy!" and a look of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt. The offices appeared to be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted, until Eade entered without knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a small room in which an Indian clerk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in a white duck suit that looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">much too tight for comfort and wearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white sun helmet well on the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, was seated writing at a desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you tell me, please," asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American, "if I shall find a Mr. Charles</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clerk, who was a Telegu, a Hindu</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a person of no little importance in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own estimation--if in nobody's else--got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An affirmative reply, sir," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, with a heartiness that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">took Eade's breath away. "Mr. Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright has the responsible charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number Two division. A considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">mileage from headquarters even as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crow flies. But I can send out for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if your esteemed business is at all pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipitous?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was too concerned with his cousin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety to note the man's extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice of words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is Mr. Cartwright's bungalow far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Telegu pointed out of the window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the hill downstream upon which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade had seen the bungalows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The second of those residences, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is officially deputed to the assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager responsible for division Num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber Two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At what time should Mr. Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">have left his bungalow this morning?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"At a quarter to five, sir, though of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course some procrastination may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">unavoidably delayed him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade thought for a moment, his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be dark then," said he, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, and then to the clerk, "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know for a fact that Mr. Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">did go out to the estate this morning?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Telegu stared at him in astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, his sleepy eyes opening sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to display white rims of eyeballs. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time he leaned forward on the table;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the American noticed his refined, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most feminine hands, the tapering fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminating in lead coloured finger nails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see, sir, you anticipate some bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">pill," the clerk interposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said the other. "Mr. Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright is my cousin. I've come out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States to find him; and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my way up this river I learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life is in very serious danger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Telegu threw up his hands, pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pably alarmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't say so," he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sir, that is almost well nigh inconceiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. Mr. Cartwright is so jolly popular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By gosh, sir, you have indeed hurled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue bolt at me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," said Eade, "you and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">better go up to Mr. Cartwright's bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low right now. It may startle you to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but there's some reason to fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst has happened. He may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been murdered during the night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clerk flew to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, I stir my stumps!" he cried. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, suddenly looking frightened again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hesitated. "You have a weapon?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade produced his automatic, the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which gave the man some confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In an uncivilized vicinity," said he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"self-defense is a good egg. You may take</seg><seg type="columnLine">my word for that, sir."</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON THE WAY up the hill, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad, red road, he plied Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">with questions. The American</seg><seg type="columnLine">told the clerk that the boat on which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come upriver lay stranded some miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">downstream, and that a Chinese stowa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way had gone overboard into the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the deliberate intention of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Nolak to murder Cartwright. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left the ship, the man had cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly been unarmed; but if there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">157</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages in the jungle, he might have got</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of a Malay kris en route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no Malay village anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximate," said the Telegu. "Farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the hills there are Orang Benua--</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty black men, sir," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tones of his voice suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost contempt and disgust. Eade re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded him with surprised amusement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the clerk's complexion was a rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">chocolate brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the top of the hill the road was over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung by palm trees. On the right was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of four or five bungalows, each sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by its own garden, a lawn of well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mown kiss grass and formal beds, gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tropical flowers. The veranda of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each bungalow was decorated with orchids</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hanging baskets, as well as with various</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinds of trailing plants and ferns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Telegu halted at the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps of the second bungalow. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly scared; there was a kind of leaden</seg><seg type="columnLine">color about his gills, and he kept tugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously at his long mustache.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After you, sir," he bowed. "Pray go</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. Let us hope there's no fat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish kettle," he observed. "That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be terrible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Eade was wise enough to take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic from his* pocket before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended the steps to the veranda. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen enough of Liu Tang to be pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to shoot at sight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bungalow consisted of but three</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms--a long oblong room that extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the whole front and two smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms at the back, each having doors into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front room and connecting one with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. The big room was furnished as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting and dining room, the chairs being</seg><seg type="columnLine">basketwork. Of the two rooms at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, one was Charles Cartwright's bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and the other, a guest room from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which there were steps that descended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bathroom below the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Eade searched the place cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously on tiptoe, the Telegu waited at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the steps apparently ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly for his life at the first sign of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither in the sitting room nor in Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright's bedroom was there any sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, save scores of lizards upon both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and the canvas ceiling that sagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the attap roof. But in the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">room he came unexpectedly upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese coolie seated on an empty pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing case, whitening a pair of tennis shoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was startled out of his life at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of an armed intruder. Failing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the boy understand a word he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade returned to the doorway and man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to persuade the clerk to enter. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telegu came in shivering, glancing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him nervously and with his back to a wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving sidewise like a crab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he saw the coolie, who could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been much more than sixteen years</seg><seg type="columnLine">of age, he immediately gained confidence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him one or two questions in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictatorial tones of a schoolmaster, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then interpreted to Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He says that no one has come here</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Mr. Cartwright went out," he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared. "That was before daybreak this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. He says we will fish out Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright's boy from the kitchen. The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">can speak English. He will tell you any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing you want to know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the coolie, they went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few wooden steps into the bathroom--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wooden tub in a bare room with a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crete floor, a water tap protruding from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall and shower bath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From this place there was a small door</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led into the garden across which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel path led straight to the outbuilding</seg><seg type="columnLine">which comprised the servants' sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters and the kitchen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, in a semi-dark, steaming room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the air was alive with flies whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzing was almost deafening, were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese--a short fat cook and a tall thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">"boy", or personal servant--as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Malay kerboon who should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work in the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the American had no wish to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main in that atmosphere longer than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to, he asked the boy to step out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden, where he received prompt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent answers in pidgin English to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Cartwright had gone out to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work as usual that morning at a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">158</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">to five, and would not return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow till twelve o'clock for tiffin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After he had been called, Mr. Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright had had his chota hazri. He never</seg><seg type="columnLine">took very long to dress, as he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaved until he came home at midday.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He always rode a bicycle up to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">division; and sometimes when there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much work to be done his lunch was taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to him. As Mr. Cartwright had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">no such orders that morning, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain to return to the bungalow at</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twelve o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade gave a sigh of relief. If Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright was at work on the estate with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang of Tamil coolies, his life could be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no immediate danger, especially as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy informed him that his master in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">variably carried a revolver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE AMERICAN was in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds what to do: He might take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a walk along the road, to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright coming back, or he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain in the bungalow and await his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin's arrival. He did not feel in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least disposed to adopt the former course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having had little or no sleep during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, he was dead tired; and besides, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was now well up and the heat terrific.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the other hfind, it occurred to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to wait in the bungalow might in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volve a certain amount of personal risk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presumably Liu Tang was still on his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Nolak through the jungle and might</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive at any moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The circumstance that he still had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature made Eade disinclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk even a short distance. He felt a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heaviness in his limbs and every joint</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his body ached. All he wanted to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to fling himself down upon a bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quench his thirst and drop off to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his returning to the bungalow, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursory inspection of the place at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested a compromise. There were but</seg><seg type="columnLine">two entrances to the building--the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the veranda, and the door into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathroom. The latter could be locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the inner side; and having done this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade was careful to put the key in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. As an additional precaution, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered the trapdoor which had stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">open at the head of the bathroom steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the spare room; and, assisted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese boy--to whom he explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation--he moved the chest of drawers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had barred that way all right. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">military parlance, his flanks and rear were</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure. The Telegu clerk, before re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to his office, assured him that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could trust both the Chinese boy and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolie to keep a sharp look-out on all sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bungalow. Feeling tolerably safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade asked the boy for some quinine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed fifteen grains, and then lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on one of the long chairs on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda with a big tumbler of well iced</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonic water and his loaded pistol on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small wickerwork table close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had placed himself immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the steps, up which no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascend without being seen. At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he realized that he would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercise a certain amount of will power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep himself awake. There were two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three shelves of books in the sitting room;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had no desire to read.</seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN EADE lay in that long chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than three hours, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but his thoughts for. com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany, and the lizards of all sizes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed in the bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had plenty to think about. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">very fact that, if he fell asleep he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his throat cut or be shot w'ith his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, was enough to keep him awake. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was free to puzzle his brains to his heart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">content, to ask himself riddles he knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mystery of the island of Singan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The extraordinary people who lived there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Quental had described: Batista</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala and Bernard Le Camus, Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala's father. And what has happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to madame herself? She had vanished as</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly and unaccountably as if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been spirited away. And why had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles been obliged to fly for his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the island? Was it jealousy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala's part that had made him send Liu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tang to the Yalai River or was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">159</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other motive at the back of it.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade, perplexed and baffled, reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that he had but to wait a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer. He was bound to learn the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Charles as soon as his cousin arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, a new fear possessed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The road to the estate led through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. What, if Liu Tang attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles Cartwright on his way home--</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in wait for him and took him by sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise? It was easy enough to knock a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man off a bicycle. A stick thrust into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokes was enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade called the boy, whose name he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered to be Ah Yen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is Mr. Cartwright ever late?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Always about same time," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese. "Him come few minutes now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I catch his shaving water, and then lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">table for tiffin. Master wantchee me lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">two places?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may as well," said Eade, "though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't feel inclined to eat much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy went into the bedroom, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than a minute returned. So far as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese's face can express anything, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be more concerned than sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Master got Mr. Cartwright's razor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Razor!" Eade exclaimed. "Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No can find," said the Chinese, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusive shrug of the shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade got to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had better look for it," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What kind of a razor is it? A safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said the boy. "Mr. Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">use backward razor, all same number one</seg><seg type="columnLine">size pocket knife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Eade, "he had it yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, I suppose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see it last night, dinner time, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing table," said the Chinese.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'Member very well, master. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright go out to dinner, and I tidy</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Look see all belong proper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade stared at the boy in astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're dead sure you saw this razor</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certain sure, master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it's nowhere in the bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make look see everywhere," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy. "No can find."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade was silent a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" he exclaimed, half under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath. "Then somebody has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here just before or just after sunrise!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he tried to think, he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that owing to a splitting headache, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as he could do to arrive at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplest logical deduction. If the razor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been stolen, it was more than prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able that it had been stolen by Liu Tang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Charles had been called by his servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">at half past four, and had left for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate at about a quarter to five, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang must have got to the bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere between the latter hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunrise, which would be about six o'clock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It looked as if Liu Tang had taken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor that he might use it as an effective</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon when an opportunity presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And if that were so, where was Liu Tang</seg><seg type="columnLine">now? He was not in the bungalow--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a certainty. He must be hiding some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in the jungle; and there was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly a chance that he might intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack Cartwright on his way home upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unfrequented road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade's nerves were all on edge. He fell1</seg><seg type="columnLine">the want of sleep; he had a touch of fever;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation in which he found himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides being novel to his experience, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in the nature of a climax.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOFT, unsteady footsteps upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps that led to the veranda caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to swing round in alarm, hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his pistol ready to fire. For a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was convinced that he was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find himself face to face with Liu Tang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the would-be murderer of his cousin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The footsteps he had heard had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick and shuffling--those of one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has bare feet, or who wears light, soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He beheld, instead, a sight that was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once amazing and pathetic. More than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half way up the steps, clutching the rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">160</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">for support as if to prevent herself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling, full in the tropic sunlight, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Scala.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brilliant sunshine framed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender figure as in gold. In a way, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an apotheosis of the woman he had last</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen on board the Chauve-Souris, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had looked up at her from the well-deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her face was drawn and haggard, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared with blood, which had dried upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powder on her cheeks. Her scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips were drawn back as if she suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. The thin silk pajama suit that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wearing had been torn by thorns in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen places, and her flimsy shoes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat to ribbons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked half savage, half martyr;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet she had lost little of her beauty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a wild expression in her eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of a hunted thing. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that she was so exhausted and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak that it was as much as she could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As with a great effort, she dragged her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self up the few remaining steps. Recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizing Eade, she came forward, tottering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both hands stretched out in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. And what struck John Eade as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most incongruous thing about her was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold wrist-watch studded with diamonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You! Here!" she exclaimed. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me--Charles, he is safe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So far as I know," said Eade. "But you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame, you must lie down and rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had moved toward her, when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back a step, and passed a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">across her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Liu Tang has not come?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so far as we know," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The bon Dieu be praised! Monsieur, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was asleep--you remember where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me, on the deck. I woke up with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">start. I do not know why. I saw the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Liu Tang--that devil's face--quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to me--in the moonlight. I think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked; and then he fled. It took me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to recover myself. I heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to force his way into Quental's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. I saw him struggling to open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. But when I came upon the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, he saw me and threw the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cabin porthole. Is Quental</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead?" she asked, suddenly breaking off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Eade. "He missed--by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraction of an inch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave a sigh of relief, and went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Liu Tang sprang overboard into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle like a wildcat. I knew what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to do--to come here, to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles. And I know, too, from whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his orders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you went in pursuit of him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade exclaimed. "Madame, you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She leaned for support against the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chair in which John Eade had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent the greater part of the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, monsieur, I was mad, desperate,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "I did not care what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me; I did not wait to think. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump ashore, but one foot went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, into the mud. I had my electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch in my right hand. I switched it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw where I was. I caught hold of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bough of a tree, pulled myself out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and hurried after Liu Tang. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes I could hear him in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, breaking his way through the jungle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But soon after I had come to a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, I lost him. He is strong, that man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is like a leopard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She paused, as if she wanted breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then tried to draw her silken shreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clothing closer about her stooping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sylph-like body. Eade's feelings toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her were a mixture of bewilderment, pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and admiration. His own fears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles were forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must rest, madame!" he insisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You might have killed yourself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A moment. I must tell you all," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. "Mile upon mile, hour after</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour! Oh, my good friend, the never</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending jungle, it is awful! I did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I was going. I just followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, and went on, and on, and on. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch went out; but when daylight came</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see better. And then I met a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malay who told me the way to Nolak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the way he looked at me, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that he thought I was mad, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">161</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that reason he was frightened of me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had spoken in a quick, breathless</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice; and having finished her .story, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed her eyes for a moment, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened them and looked round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda, as if she saw everything there</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is impossible," said she, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang is not here! He must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been miles in front of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's true enough," said Eade. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man has been here at all, it was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than six hours ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then he has come!" she cried, in new</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madame, I know nothing for certain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to tell you the truth, there's evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he may have come and gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again she carried her hand to her heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fear for Charles," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A heavy step on the veranda caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">them both to turn. John Eade recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized his cousin at once, though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen him for more than twenty years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well over six feet in height, clean shaven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair haired and powerfully built, Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright looked younger than his years. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wearing breeches and puttees, a flan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel shirt open at the neck and a pith</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet. He stood at the head of the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his legs wide parted. He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">first at Eade and then at the lady.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he had not the remotest idea who</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cousin was, he recognized Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Valerie!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned quickly gave him one glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then closed her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God, you are safe!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed, in a voice little above a whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And had John Eade not caught her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms, she would have fallen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">NEWS OF BATTISTA &amp;CALA</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS as if the life had gone out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Her powers of endurance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taxed to the utmost. By sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">will power alone she had managed to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade the greater part of her story; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but anxiety and suspense had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept her going, until the tension was sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly relieved and she had fallen forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a swoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When John Eade made known his</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity to his cousin, Cartwright showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">little or no surprise. His sole concern</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be for Madame Scala, whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took from Eade's arms, and for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood irresolute as if he didn't know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take her to Mrs. Headley," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's certain to be at home now, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of the day. Headley's our manager,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went on to explain. "His wife'll look</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her. There's not a doctor within</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten miles of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade went to the head of the steps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up and down the road. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular object in doing so. He merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that he wanted to do something, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think of nothing that could be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way useful, just as he could think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the red road in the glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">light--shadowless, though it ran like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue between towering trees. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rays were vertical. The elongated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaucous leaves of a shrub at the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda steps shone in the glare as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were of silver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not far away, leaning against the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence that divided the garden of Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright's bungalow from that next door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man whose personal appearance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unprepossessing as it was singular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had that not been so, John Eade would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have looked at him twice, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at him, as he did, for the best part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he could not decide whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man was an Asiatic or a European.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was certainly dressed like a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, in a dust colored suit of crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shantung silk that included even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">waistcoat. He wore both a soft collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a necktie, as well as a white sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His face, however, was that of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mongol. For he had Chinese eyes--ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary big eyes, but almond shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">--beneath which were repulsive looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">162</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sacs that made him resemble some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of loathsome reptile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had, also, the cadaverous complex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion of a corpse, high cheek-bones, 'thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips half concealed by a straggling. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thin mustache, the few hairs of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooped downward to the corners of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not appear to have anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite to do. He was smoking a cigaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a holder, which it appeared to be too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much trouble for him to hold in his teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the thing hung down so far that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted end was in danger of touching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapel of his coat. Both his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust deep into his trouser pockets. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole attitude suggested indolence; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet Eade had not failed to notice that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was regarding Cartwright's bungalow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a furtive, suspicious way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment Charles himself ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on the steps, carrying Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala, whose slim body he had wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in a sheet taken from his bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on! To Headley's!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, as he brushed past. "His bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">galow's not more than half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was down the steps in no time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the right upon the road. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him to within* a few feet of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who stood loitering between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalows; and no sooner was Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of him than he stopped stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT the devil do you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?" he asked savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man took his cigaret from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth. Still leaning against a post,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he exerted himself to the extent of shifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his balance from one foot to the other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">removing a hand from his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You," said he. He pointed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, shapeless object in Cartwright's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. "Who's that?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mind your own damn' business!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried the other, with an oath. "And be</seg><seg type="columnLine">off! You're the last man on earth I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see at any time, and least of all now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">With that Charles hurried on, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the center of the roadway to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass at the side, under the shade of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms. And as he walked he hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions over a shoulder to his cousin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who found it was as much as he could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep up with him. Cartwright was</seg><seg type="columnLine">told the bare facts of what had happened:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discovery of Liu Tang on board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauve-Souris; the stranding of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle-boat; the escape of the Chinese,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Madame Scala's pursuit of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad only in pajamas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By that time they had reached a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow standing in a well kept and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious garden. Passing up a drive that</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a semicircle, they came suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">within sight of th^ house, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda of which stood a high wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">gig, with a Malay syce holding the pony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Headley's there himself," said Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright. "He tiffins early and then drives</seg><seg type="columnLine">round the estate in the heat of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea being--from what I know of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to cultivate a thirst."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The manager of the Nolak Estate, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bald headed fellow who had run to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat in the East, met them on the steps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright hastily explained so much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew of the situation. A lady he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known in Singan had tried to find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">way alone to Nolak through the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat on which she had come up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">river being stranded some way down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. She had fainted from exhaustion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but had recovered consciousness before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his bungalow. All he wanted was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask Mrs. Headley to look after her; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary, some one could be sent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bukit Tirah for the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Headley, who looked as mystified as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a cheery, almost circular face</seg><seg type="columnLine">can, declared that his wife would un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly do everything in her power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And no sooner were the words out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth than Cartwright went straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bungalow, leaving John Eade to</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduce himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There followed further interrogations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade using his discretion as to what ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent to confide in his cousin's superior.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headley, however, appeared to be a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who took life as he found it, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived long enough in the East to be sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised at nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks as if your cousin had got him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into a fix," he observed. "We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less used to that sort of thing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. An Indian June from one year's end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other, you know; and you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember that Kipling says something or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other about married women and new</seg><seg type="columnLine">pianos. However, that's not my affair;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I suppose it don't matter a great lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He offered Eade a drink which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American accepted. According to Head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, whisky was the one great panacea</seg><seg type="columnLine">for malaria and all the other ills of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orient. Whenever he got anything the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter with him--which was seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough--why, he just drank it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except that his face was somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">colorless and pasty, he looked healthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; and anyway, he was brim full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vital energy and humor. While wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for his cousin, Eade availed himself of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opportunity to tell Headley of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate of the Chauve-Souris and to ask if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything could be done to get the paddle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat out of the mud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've no tugs here," said the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager. "I know that little packet well; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't mind telling you her reputation's</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the best. But I'll send a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Quental; and if a gang of coolies can</seg><seg type="columnLine">help him, they can go down on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon Cartwright's return, Headley</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the two men nearly half an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">offering them one drink after another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he would let them go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN John Eade and his cousin</seg><seg type="columnLine">found themselves again upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadway on their way back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright's bungalow, Eade acquainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cousin of his good luck, of the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had brought him out to the East.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The old lady has left you a very com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable fortune," said he. "And if you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the advice of an old friend, this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll stick to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cartwright seemed to take the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less as a matter of course. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed neither elated nor surprised. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Eade critically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yqu've altered a lot, John, since I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">you last," said he. "I don't think I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have recognized you, even if I hadn't had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else to think about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you've changed mighty little</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the old days at college," said Eade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You look bigger and strong perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you haven't grown out of your boy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, I don't know how I've man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged it," Cartwright laughed. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind telling you I've been in hell since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out here--stone-broke more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, absolutely down and out, John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I've had some strange experiences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. But tell me more about this business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What brought Madame Scala and Liu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tang up here? I haven't yet quite got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang of it all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade again related the whole story, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in greater detail. Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened with the utmost attention. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">never interrupted, save for an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation, until his cousin came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part when the Chinese boy had declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his master's razor was missing. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Cartwright whistled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then Liu Tang was inside my bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low some time this morning," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Looks as if I was lucky!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So far as I can make out," said Eade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"he must have got there between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when you left and sunrise. Had you</seg><seg type="columnLine">been asleep when he got here, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have murdered you; for, according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Scala, that's what he came here</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. On the other hand, he couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen the razor when it was broad day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. He could never have got into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow without being seen by one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your servants."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That seems rational enough, John.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have you started business as a private</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective? If so, you ought to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me where Liu Tang is now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know that," said Eade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"From what we know, it seems probable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, having got hold of your razor, he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding somewhere and biding his time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's not likely to show up until after dark."</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" Cartwright suddenly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "I never thought of it before!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's a scoundrel here who was out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singan with me, who would give a lot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see me under ground. Of course', Liu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tang may not know he's here; but if that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rascal happens to come across the gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who calls himself Mr. Eugene Pai,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll have two of them to tackle, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade glanced at his cousin. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a sudden idea that was not alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether reassuring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What sort of a fellow is that man?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Man!" repeated Cartwright. "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a man. A Shanghai sewer rat--half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him Chinese, while not even he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self knows what the other half is. I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect he thinks Eugene sounds better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yu Chin. In this place he's running a</seg><seg type="columnLine">store where he sells cheap gin to Tamil</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolies and conducts a profitable money</seg><seg type="columnLine">lending business. A week's credit at</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty per cent! I warned him that if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any trouble with him, I'd get Headley</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clear him out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's not the point," said Eade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is this the man you spoke to when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">left your bungalow, the chap you told to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear out and mind his own business?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," said Charles. "I wonder what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow was doing, hanging around</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. He may have seen Madame Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in; and that's why he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk to me. John, this looks like trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AS HE was speaking, Cartwright not</seg><seg type="columnLine">h\ only quickened his footsteps, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">■*- he had visibly paled. As he ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached his bungalow, he broke into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">run and dashed up the steps of the ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">randa three at a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah Yen!" he shouted. And rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cuckoo out of a clock, the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy appeared from the spare bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah Yen!" said Charles. "I want the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. Has Eugene Pai been in this bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low during my absence?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, master," promptly answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say him wantchee see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that was a damned lie," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright, "for he knew I wasn't here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How long after I had gone out did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No can say, master," replied Ah Yen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When you go, I go kitchen-side to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiffin. Coolie there, too. Nobody in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow. When I come back, I find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eugene Pai standing in veranda, all same</seg><seg type="columnLine">corkscrew, just like he see ghost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Corkscrew! Looking as if he'd seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost!" echoed Cartwright. "What the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dickens do you mean, Ah Yen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Him standing very funny way. Body</seg><seg type="columnLine">all bent sideways. Him look plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened, when he seen me. Then him</seg><seg type="columnLine">make bobbery, shout very loud, 'Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Cartlight, you number one size</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool?'. I tell him no belong my pidgin."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright, with raised eyebrows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned round slowly and stared at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you make head or tail of that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John?" asked he. "Because I'm blowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Eade shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nor I," said he. "You've got to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member I'm not only a stranger in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, and from what I've seen of it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't mind telling you I'm darned glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am. But I know absolutely nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about what's been happening in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place Singan, from which, I'm told, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped by the skin of your teeth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've no time to tell you all that now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Charles hurriedly. "You wait here</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few minutes. If you've got a touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fever, you want to keep out of the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going down to the office to tell our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telegu clerk--who is one of the best men</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have on the estate--that he's got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get hold of a policeman and keep Eugene</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pai under close observation until he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">further orders from me. There are two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men here of the Malay States Police. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the responsibility. The district</seg><seg type="columnLine">police officer only comes here once in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue moon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cartwright was out of the bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had finished; and Eade, glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of a rest, flung himself into, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">165</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. Neither the brisk walk in the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun nor Headley's whisky pegs appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have done him any harm. On the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trary, he had broken out into a mild</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiration--evidence that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken off his chill and his temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For all that, he was as puzzled as ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he had given his cousin the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of all the information he had, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been told little or nothing in return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never once had Charles mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Scala, though he had evidenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest anxiety in regard to her. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole business was as great a mystery as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. The only source of satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade had was that he had found his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin safe and well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade waited for more than an hour;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as his cousin had not by then re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, and he felt well nigh starved, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Ah Yen that he would get ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what there was to eat. Having made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first introduction to Malay curry, he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">an irresistible desire to go to sleep; which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was natural enough in the circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy had made the bed in the spare</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Eade took off half his clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flung himself down, and almost at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once was fast asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE MUST have slept for more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours; for when he woke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun was low, its rays stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the open bungalow windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the atmosphere was considerably</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade got up, explored the bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found it empty. In the kitchen he</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered Ah Yen, who informed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his master had not yet returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The setting sun was like a great ball of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, hanging low above the dark trees of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle up the river valle3r, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles Cartwright came tearing up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps in as great haste as he had gone out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's the devil to pay!" he cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he saw his cousin. "Eugene Pai</seg><seg type="columnLine">has cut off. He left the place soon after</seg><seg type="columnLine">midday. It has taken me the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the afternoon to find out that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has left his store in charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman who helps him, and has gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">downstream by himself in a canoe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't see anything particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarming in that," observed John Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said the other, "Pai wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave ? all his worldly belongings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of a Chink, if he hadn't got some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing urgent to do. But that's not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst of it. Quental got here at half</seg><seg type="columnLine">past three. He managed to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauve-Souris off the mud, and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchored just above our jetties. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been on board and seen him, and he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me just about the worst news I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to hear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" asked Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Scala's on the river."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean madame's husband?"Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None other. Scala's the nearest thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the devil in all East Indies, and that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no mean compliment, John. He has come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over from Singan in a motor launch he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">got, a boat he uses for river and coastal</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. There 're plenty of places on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way where he could pick up petrol--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macassar, Surabaya, Batavia, Palembang</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Singapore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's after his wife?" suggested Eade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. And me. And for some reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other he has brought poor old Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Camus with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madame's father, if Quental can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted," said Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quental can't be trusted, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to be right. The old man's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bait with which he hopes to catch his wife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would never have kept that woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these years, if it hadn't been for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">love she has for her father. He had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man's money long ago; that was all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted. He keeps Le Camus drugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with opium, a moral and physical wreck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who has lost all the will power he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever possessed. My God, he has just got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him like a caged bird! It's only pity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father, and the knowledge that she can</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and again do little things to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, that has kept Madame Scala in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She seems to have left the place on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your account," said Eade significantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">166</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charles glanced at his cousin quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"John," said he, in a serious voice, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">take my gospel oath I've played the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game--or tried to." He threw out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with a hopeless gesture. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I help being sorry for her?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "What could I do but help her all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could? And if you want the truth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, you shall have it: It's neither my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault nor hers that we're in love."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"I guessed that," said Eade, in a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "Bad business, Charles! These</seg><seg type="columnLine">things always are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cartwright rounded upon him angrily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't preach to me!" he almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. "I've done nothing I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed of. You'll admit that yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you know the truth. You and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have got other things to discuss now, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides morality. Scala went on board the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauve-Souris and saw Quental. Darned</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky for Quental he didn't kill him--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have done, if this had been Singan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he knows we've got police and law</seg><seg type="columnLine">courts here, and he never does anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">on impulse; and besides, there was a fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">German on board who took a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bovine interest in what was going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Charles continued, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause for breath, "Scala questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental; and as the little Portuguese was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared stiff at the very sight of him, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">once in his life he couldn't tell a lie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala got the whole truth about what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened in the night, how Liu Tang had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been captured and escaped, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">madame had vanished. Quental saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Camus through the windows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon on the launch. He said the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man looked more haggard and ill than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, utterly broken and dejected."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And where's the launch now?" Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just the trouble," said Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright. "Scala went up-stream, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one at our offices saw him pass. Nor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental see him on his way up to Nolak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That means that he's turned into one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the backwaters--there 're lots of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributaries that flow through the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that launch only draws a few feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water: Scala's hiding somewhere, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow or other Eugene Pai knows it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and has gone to find him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade uttered an exclamation of aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't know that for a certainty!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do," said Charles. "For the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason that Pai left here nearly four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before Quental arrived; and Quen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal, who was on the bridge all the way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, is ready to swear that nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Eade tried to think. Within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last few hours so many things had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened that it was as if there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the atmosphere that made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult for a man to breathe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If this fellow, Scala, has gone straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some hiding place in the jungle," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, "it looks as if the whole plan was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged. And the chances are," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, "that where Scala is, there too</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be Liu Tang."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's on the cards," said Charles. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if so, they're waiting for something--</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting until it's dark."</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT HAPPENED IN SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">DINNER that night in Cartwright's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow was a surprisingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant meal, in the circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances. The two cousins, who had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen each other for years, had plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">news to exchange. Eade had entirely got</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his touch of fever. He had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a chill on board the Chauve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Souris in the misty river valley; but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature could never have been very</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, and in the heat of the day he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweated the fever out of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Eade was not a man who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to finding himself in a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">of considerable danger. He was one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, who was susceptible to both at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere and environment; and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening he could not but be conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the novelty of the situation. Though, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all intents and purposes his cousin was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same boy whom he had known years</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">167</seg><seg type="columnLine">before at college, that was the strangest</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal that he had ever had in his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They dined on the veranda, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumined by three large oil-paper Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanterns. Ah Yen waited at table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the plates and dishes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the coolie boy who brought them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the kitchen up the front steps. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as if they were sitting in a fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished greenhouse. The trellis-work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda was overgrown with creepers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orchids in their hanging baskets sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended from the eaves of the attap roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled so many minute, fairy faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeping curiously from out of banks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moss and fern. Ah Yen moved here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, soft footed, his features inscrutable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his bright eyes were wonderfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the veranda the night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark as pitch. There was no moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not even the palm trees across the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">were visible, though they leaned towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bungalow and could not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more than ten yards away. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, there were no stars. The mist from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river hung like a pall above the tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had already discussed their plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright had decided that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless to try to find Scala that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They might as well look for a needle in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">haystack. There were so many jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams up any one of which the Singan</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch could have made its way, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might explore a dozen before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the right one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so Mahomet could come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain. If they remained where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, sooner or later Liu Tang would</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn up all right. The Chinese hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen Cartwright's razor for nothing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they could do no better than be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for him. Even as they dined, Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his automatic, and Cartwright a Colt</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver, both ready loaded in their coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets. Also, the two Sikh policemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the district officer had detailed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty at the Nolak estate were on watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, one in the jungle at the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen, the other on the far side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roadway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade caught something of his cousin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-confidence. Instead of being nervous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Eade would have expected him to be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was* more speculative than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. He even let fall the observation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hoped the night wouldn't pass off</seg><seg type="columnLine">without event.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you're worked up to concert</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch," he observed, "guess you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">something better to do than twiddle your</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbs. You've got the stage set,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles, my boy, for a very pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy or comedy--whichever it's going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be; and if this fellow doesn't turn up</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time in the night, I shall feel I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a moral right to get my money back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">OHN EADE remembered that remark</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Knowledge that. Madame Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in safe hands and being well looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">after was quite enough to put Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright at ease for the time being. If Liu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tang was joined by Eugene Pai, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Scala himself, they would find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition more than they bargained</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. The Sikhs, who were big and strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, were armed with rifles and, as ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers of the Indian army, first class</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots. It was impossible that any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could approach the bungalow unheard by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ask nothing more," said Charles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"than a reasonable excuse to put a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that Chinaman. Had I not got</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Singan in the nick of time, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Scala would have made short work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By which token," said Eade, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may as well tell me what actually hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened on the island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charles pushed a box of Borneo che-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots towards his cousin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try one of those," said he. "You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke 'em all day. But you've got. to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep your throat wet in this country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headley drinks short drinks one after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and mixes gin with rye whisky. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe in that. On the Equator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't drink until sundown, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick to stingers, and put them away as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as you like. Singan, eh? Well, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sort of hell; but I'm glad I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. I wasn't in the place a year, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet those months have changed my life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know that, John. Damned funny thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world! It was just a fluke it ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on to tell Eade how he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met Madame Scala by chance on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singapore praya. He wasn't much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychologist, but it's pretty clear to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that certain personalities blend, so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, whilst others clash. Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala, whom he called Valerie, had liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the first. And he had liked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and that was a mild way of putting it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was why he had gone to Singan in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first place, though he had thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fool for doing so. It was like buying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pig in a poke; but the uncertainty of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole business had rather appealed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE HAD MET Scala the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Cafe Riche, behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singapore Club, and hated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man the moment he saw him. A big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad shouldered fellow, with black eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curly hair and a black mustache--a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cross between an operatic tenor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traditional bandit and the reigning mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arch of some tinpot principality. Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied himself no end; he was conceited</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his physical strength, his good</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks, his brains and money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though he was a Sicilian by birth, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been educated in Holland. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother was probably Dutch. Anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a young man he had gone to Java,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had had something to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big shipping firm in Surabaya. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">company had agents in most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oriental ports, and Scala had spent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good many years knocking around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indies and all the coast from Rangoon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shanghai. At one time he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted in Bangkok, whence he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to Saigon; and there he had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with old Le Camus and his daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Le Camus was a French colonial</seg><seg type="columnLine">official who had come into a good deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. In spite of his daughter, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't tear himself away from Cochin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">China, because of opium. He was living</seg><seg type="columnLine">a life of ease and idleness, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opium smoker's extravagant ideas, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell into Scala's clutches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before then, Scala had discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singan--a little island, not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty miles across, lying not far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beaten track between Macassar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Balikh Papan in Borneo, due south of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Paternoster Islands, and north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west of the Spermonde Archipelago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala had landed there at some time or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and made friends with the sultan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was quick enough to see possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the place. The virgin jungle was thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mature and healthy rubber trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only wanted clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got Le Camus to come into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, and it was the old man's money</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bought a good third of the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sultan had had a taste of Occidental</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization, and wanted more of it; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which end he found a banking account in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris more than helpful. He did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grand tour, not in the approved manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an Eastern potentate--for no one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever heard of him--but with the sole idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of exploring all the dissolute haunts he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find between Port Said and Mont-</seg><seg type="columnLine">martre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He duly returned to Singan with en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larged ideas and a lightened purse. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time Scala's scheme was well under</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He had got a gang of Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolies down from Hainan to do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing work; and Liu Tang had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">off as foreman. In course of time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astute Chinese became a partner, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he who suggested the main lines upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the business should be run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For Scala soon found out that rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">planting wasn't as profitable as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, especially as his so-called expert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Eugene Pai, let him down badly more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than onee. Besides, there was too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">competition in the field. And then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government restriction of output in</seg><seg type="columnLine">British Malaya; and that was Scala's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Liu Tang fixed it with Japanese estates</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the peninsula who were ready to dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government and anxious to get rid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">169</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surplus stuff at a moderately fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">price. Quental was engaged to do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">running; and nobody in the world can</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat the Japanese at a game like that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They got their stuff out of Perak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johore without the authorities being any</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wiser. Scala couldn't trade with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Javanese ports because of Anglo-Dutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooperation, but he found a ready buyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Shanghai who was willing to ship to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a profitable business, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have gone on indefinitely, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala not been greedy. By then he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been married to Valerie Le Camus about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four years, just long enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire of her. And the very fact, too, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was the only person in the island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except Liu Tang, who did not tremble at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very sight of him, made him furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her. Yet in some fashion he loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then," Charles added, lowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice, "the sultan saw her--and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the story's damnable. He used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no end of excuses to come down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala's bungalow, so that he might see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valerie. He never spoke to her. He just</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there and stared at her; and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to frighten the life out of her, for he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fat, oily looking brtite. A pure bred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malay, all the same. That's the funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">part about it. Nearly everywhere you</seg><seg type="columnLine">go in this part of the world you'll find two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three distinct races living in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. I expect the sultan's forebear</seg><seg type="columnLine">who first settled in Singan was a Malay</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate who wanted a comfortable life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aboriginal inhabitants are more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less Dyaks. There're not many of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">left; and they're no good for work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sultan's palace, as he calls it, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a hill on the north side of the island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well away from Scala's estate. He's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">about half a dozen Malay wives. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montmartre has given him somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced ideas, and he suddenly came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conclusion that he ought to include a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white woman in the collection. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala wanted more land. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">open up a tract of country to the west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had found the best soil in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. He had got to the end of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Camus's money, and he was putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In true Oriental fashion, the sultan</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his time over the bargain. I've some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to believe that weeks elapsed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he had the pluck to put the propo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition into so many words. He had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful because, like every one else, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid of Scala. He suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala should swap Valerie for a new con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cession of land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IND YOU, John, I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, when I got there; nor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valerie herself. They wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real planter to run the show. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Scala had come over to Singapore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Valerie found me by chance. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got to Singan, I soon tumbled to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">their game was. They had an A 1 little</seg><seg type="columnLine">harbor tucked away behind a long, tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered islet that screened the place from</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of any ships that happened to pass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had made a proper wharf, in water</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep enough for the Chauve-Souris to</seg><seg type="columnLine">berth alongside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quental's boat was called the Bat</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she used to fly by night. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf was a godown, where they stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff which Quental took up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shanghai about three times a year. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned Eugene Pai into a kind of store-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man after I got there. Though I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to go into that godown, or have</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to do with it, I darned soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out that there was more rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">there than we had ever tapped in Singan."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did Madame Scala know that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. She hated her husband, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated the whole business; but she couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave because of her father. Quental al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways brought up supplies of opium from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singapore, and the whole lot of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked it--even Valerie, sometimes, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to drown her sorrows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She never looked that sort!" Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because she's no fool," Charles</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "She never let the drug get</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of her. Nor did Scala for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. As for Liu Tang, he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrive on it. The old man, and to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent Quental, were the only two who</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to pieces. I stayed there because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valerie. For a long time I never said</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to her, nor she to me; but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood one another all right. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew I was her friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's why I went about with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes skinned," he continued. "When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out that I had joined a concern</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was five-sixths a smuggling business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it didn't worry me much. I knew there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a good deal more than that going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the scenes. I had to watch four</seg><seg type="columnLine">people: Scala, Eugene Pai, Liu Tang and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sultan. I had no idea what I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to discover, but I soon struck oil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It hadn't taken me long to size up Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eugene Pai, or Quental either; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that they had both got more re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibility than was good for them. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that they were carrying on busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in a small way on their own. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were selling stuff privately and faking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way-bills."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely Scala checked his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores?" Eade asked. "He wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a fool as not to do that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course he did," said Charles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But not all the smuggled rubber that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental brought down from the Malay</seg><seg type="columnLine">States went into that godown. Quental</seg><seg type="columnLine">always came into the harbor from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, where there was a narrow strait</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Singan and the islet, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded a coral reef at the end of what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Seraglio Point. They gave it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">name because the channel was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature Bosporus; and behind Seraglio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Point there was a shallow creek, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a northwesterly direction, just like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Horn. Scala knew Constanti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nople well, and so did Le Camus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quental nearly always came in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night; and Eugene Pai with two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese--who made a good thing out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'squeeze'--used to wait for him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south side of Seraglio Point with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft. They would take off as much sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus stuff as they could carry and store</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in a safe place in the jungle--a hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground covered with branches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm leaves, something like an elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you discover that by chance?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir. Not by a long chalk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When you find a rat run, you may bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">your last dollar it leads to a chicken coop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I struck their track in the jungle and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a bit of a woodsman, I had no diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty in finding their hiding-place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What did you do then?" asked Eade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did you take the story to Scala and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make an enemy of Eugene Pai for life?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No fear," said Charles. "I didn't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hoots whether they swindled Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not. I didn't even tell Valerie about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, until months afterward--after I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that her brute of a husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thinking of selling her to the sultan."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And how did you find that out?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Eavesdropping," Charles confessed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"By then Valerie and I were beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand one another. She had warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">me there was danger ahead, though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know anything for sure. I risked</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life one night by getting inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace, which is nothing more or less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair sized bungalow', with a separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">building for the harem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They discussed business in the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">mongrel language that any two human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings ever spoke. Though I was hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the window and could overhear</seg><seg type="columnLine">every word that was said, I could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand half of it. It was made up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malay, Chinese, French, pidgin English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dutch and Pulu Petak, the southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect of Borneo. As I understood them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, except the two last, I managed to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of the drift of what they were talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The next day," he went on, "I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valerie about it. We met by appoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in the jungle, out by Seraglio Point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I offered, then and there, to take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">away; but she wouldn't go because of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. We thought we were alone, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we weren't! We had been shadowed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eugene Pai. I expect he got the wind up</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had seen me going oft' in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">171</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fortunately I spotted him and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him before he could split to Scala. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going to trust my life and Valerie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that man. He thought he had got me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had always hated the sight of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but, by God, I bluffed him good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper! I told him what I knew about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game he was playing with Quental,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and exactly where he had hidden his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen goods; and what's more, John, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that I had already told Scala, and he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better clear out while the going was good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should have seen his face! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went pale green, for he knew that Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">would kill him. I hadn't any qualms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience about telling a lie to that man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got rid of him all right, and that was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted. He got a proa that very night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cleared out. And I never saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, until I turned up here, where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that he was at his old game,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheating Tamils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I ''HAT piece of bluff gave Valerie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> [j and me a breathing space,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles went on. "It gave us</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to formulate some sort of a plan;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Scala was in no particular hurry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close the deal, if the sultan was. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we knew where we were, Eugene</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his own back. H§ had seen Quental</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Singapore and told him I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous man. Afterward I got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole truth out of the Portuguese.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When next he came to Singan, he warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala that Valerie and I knew all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his proposed dealings with the sultan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My life wasn't worth a copper-cash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From that moment Scala meant to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in, and would have done it, too, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valerie hadn't warned me in time. Liu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tang was going to do the job; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very fact that Scala had struck his wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned her that he knew. He had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated her badly enough; for months she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had watched him slowly poisoning her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father with opium; he was going to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">her into the harem " of a fat, native</seg><seg type="columnLine">prince; but he had never hit her before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's more, he locked her up. But her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malay servant let her out, and she came</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We got a canoe and rowed out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauve-Souris, which was anchored in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel. It was pitch dark when we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board. We found Quental half</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugged with opium, but Valerie knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to knock some sense into his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was under steam already, and we told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if he didn't weigh anchor then and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, we would give him away to Scala.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether he liked it or not, he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same boat as ourselves; and as I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of the island without loss of time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have to do the same or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">share my fate. That settled him all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. He knew that, if he gave me up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fd split on him. He saw the game was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended.,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, there was a scene with Valerie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I begged and implored her to come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. But she just set her teeth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't. Her father was dying, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and she couldn't desert him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally I wanted to stay too. I swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't leave her. But she told me it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't any good my staying--they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">only kill me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was sense enough in that," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade. "What happened after you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left? And how is it that they have all</seg><seg type="columnLine">come here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She has told me that," said Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright. "I had a few minutes' talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in Headley's bungalow. Scala never</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew why Pai had disappeared; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quental suddenly cutting off in the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the night made him suspicious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took him weeks to find out the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he learned it he was like a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast. He swore that he would be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venged not only on me, but on Quental</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pai. When he found out where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, he at once sent Liu Tang across to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surabaya in the motor launch, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders to catch the first steamer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singapore and not to come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singan until I was a dead man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He taunted Valerie with this, played</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her like a cat with a mouse and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that when he had finished with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would hand her over to the sultan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had actually gone up to the palace to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close the deal, when she escaped, She</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">got away in a flying proa, and had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good luck to be picked up by an Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship coming up from Port Darwin. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought she was well ahead of Liu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tang. That's why she couldn't make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he had got to Singapore in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come aboard the Chauve-Souris as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowaway. He must have had the luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fall in with one of the coastal packets</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Timor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As for the rest," he concluded, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can only guess what happened. On dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering that his wife had escaped--</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously to warn me--Scala must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarded the motor launch as soon as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back from Java. He probably had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait three or four days, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malay in charge went on the bust in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surabaya. When he got to Singapore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he probably found out from the harbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">master that the Chauve-Souris had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to Nolak. And as he knew I was here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he guessed his wife was on board."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what's happened now?" Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "What do you think the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know no more than you," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. "The only thing we're certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">about is that Scala's not far from here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we'll hear from him sooner or</seg><seg type="columnLine">later." "	»</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Supposing he attacks Headley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow?" suggested Eade. "If Eugene</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pai is with him he will have been told his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife is there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Headley's all right," said Cartwright.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've warned him, and he has armed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Malay servants. I offered him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two policemen, but he said he didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He's got about fifteen men under</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms; and when it's dark as this, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon I personally shouldn't like to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">up against is the Malay kris."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade nodded in satisfaction, and hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the butt end of his cheroot over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda, the sparks flying in the road like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kind of firework.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's one aspect of this business I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't make head or tail of," he observed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Scala wants Eugene Pai's blood almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as yours. Pai didn't strike me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as being a man with any more pluck than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cockroach. Besides, he's got a guilty</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience. One would have thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would rather run a hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">than find himself face to face with either</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang or Scala. And yet you tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he has deliberately gone down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, presumably to meet Scala by</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charles Cartwright shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders as he got to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I haven't the remotest idea," said he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawning and stretching his arms.

Stretching himself on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long chairs on the veranda, he lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">another cheroot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Charles, he went to the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps and stood there a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing into the black night in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Headley's bungalow. Suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and spoke to Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going round the outpost line,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he. "These Sikhs can be trusted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it's as well to see they're doing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went down the steps, and Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear his footsteps on the gravel as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crossed the road. Suddenly a low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless voice, with something of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarl in it, the words clipped short in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken English of every native of India</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Kashmir to Colombo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who goes there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muffled voices.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have been much use to you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now, why, I'm just glad of the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see this thing through, though I warn</seg><seg type="columnLine">you I'm not a particularly good shot."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll give you an electric torch," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. "There's a spare one. And after</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight the moon comes up--a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, too. If nothing happens before</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, it'll be almost as light as day."</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE AFTER the other he blew out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chinese lanterns on the ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anda, and then put out the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sitting room beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eade had the spare room from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps led down to the bathroom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That no intruder might enter by this way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of the bathroom that connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the garden was locked from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner side, and the trapdoor at the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps was lowered. In consequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade felt tolerably safe. Any one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed to attack them must cross both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda and the front room, before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could enter either bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nonetheless John Eade's sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">security diminished somewhat the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the bedroom lights were out, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself straining his ears, listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sounds imaginary and real. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a breath of air. The stillness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken only occasionally by faint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinite noises in the jungle. A gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">moth brushed with velvet wings past his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, so suddenly that it frightened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He certainly had no inclination to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. He lay there trying to imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kind of man this Scala was, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to picture the island of Singan. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">read about places like that in Conrad's</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, but it had never occurred to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that that sort of thing could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">real.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a way, he was sorry for Charles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't blame his cousin for having</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen in love with Madame Scala. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually smiled when he remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chauve-Souris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt that the whole of this place--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, the little he had seen of it--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">confounded his capacity to associate</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas. Little, painted, powdered women</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't, as a rule, got the reputation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">being courageous. She didn't look strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">either; and yet, how many of her sex</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been able to travel all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles through the jungle? And in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pajamas! Ye gods, what a land!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For more than an hour John Eade's</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts kept him company, kept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from getting cold feet. And then, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees, the uncanniness of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair began to tell on his nerves. Waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the darkness, unable to move--</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest the camp bed on which he lay should</seg><seg type="columnLine">creak--he found it necessary to remind</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that he was a New York business</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who believed in a comfortable life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who traveled first class and stayed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best hotels. He had now a sense of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisoned in themidstof an impenetrable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled wilderness. He imagined, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the silence, soft footed, prowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts. There might have been no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">living soul within a hundred miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Charles, in the next room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to snore--or to produce a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good imitation of the real thing. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved Eade from becoming morbid. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he not been determined to play his part</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as he could, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanked Charles audibly, for the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necting door between the two rooms was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cartwright kept up his nasal serenade</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the best part of half an hour; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, apparently getting tired of it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined himself to regular and heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing--so lifelike a reproduction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real thing that Eade began to fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he really might be asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once or twice Eade was tempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, but his amour propre prevented</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from doing that. Time and again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured himself that Charles wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a fool. And yet, the doubt per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY he sat bolt upright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of the feeling that sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gests the hair of one's head stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on end. He had heard noises before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable noises--rats, perhaps, rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiles or bats. But he could not mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quick, soft pattering of feet that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">either bare or lightly shod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As quietly as he could, he swung him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self round into a sitting position, until his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet touched the floor. At the same time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his right hand, he whipped out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic from under his pillow. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand he held his torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was startled by the sound of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin's voice, quite close to his ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait for me!" Charles whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bright beam of Cartwright's torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly stabbed into the darkness like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blade of a simitar--a dazzling, diverg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent ray that terminated in a golden disc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">framing the white face of Madame Scala.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood perfectly motionless. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the staring eyes of a blind person, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, for the moment, she was blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the glare. She could see nothing, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles switched off his torch and lit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle at the bedside. She looked first</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Charles, then at Eade, and then smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she saw their firearms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are safe at any rate," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was told that you were dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Valerie!" Charles exclaimed. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth are you doing here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was wearing a dress of Shantung</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk that belonged to Mrs. Headley--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little woman, too. She had evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently thrown it on in a hurry, for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was without stockings, and her black</seg><seg type="columnLine">shingled hair was ruffled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got much to tell you," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thank God that you are alive. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you too, Mr. Eade," she added. "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured that Charles had already been</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered with his own razor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whoever told you lied, you see," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright. "All the same there's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmer of truth in it, because my razor</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been stolen, and you couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said, and stood thinking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. "My husband is not often</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong," she added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your husband!" cried Charles. "Has</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala seen you here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was he who sent the message," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "I will tell you. I was asleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound asleep, when I was awakened by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice at my window. The veranda, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, runs round three sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow; and I was in the end room on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this side. The man at the window told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be frightened. I thought I recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized his voice the moment I heard it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I lit a candle I saw his face. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eugene Pai."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pai! How did he get there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite easily," said Madame Scala.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are men watching the house, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Headley himself is awake. Pai told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Malay syces that he wanted to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Headley and the men let him pass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose he found out from one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese servants which room I was in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did Headley see him?" asked Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. He came straight to me, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda. The message he gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">was terrible--so terrible that it could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come only from my husband. He said-</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my husband was not far away, wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for me, that I must go to him at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He swore that you were dead, that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat had been cut in your own bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and, if I didn't believe it, I could go</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and see for myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And where's Pai now?" Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. He looked rather like a dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining at a leash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Half way down the road," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, "between the Headley's bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and here. He wouldn't come any</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther. He was too frightened of Liu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tang. He thought Liu Tang was in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow, and might kill him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was that all the message?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. It is all terrible! Eugene Pai</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me my husband's orders. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go at once to the place where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch is hidden. If I do not return with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pai immediately, my father will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cartwright uttered an oath under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, and then turned to Eade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see the type of man we've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So far the game's in our favor," Eade</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "The opposition program's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to schedule. You're supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be dead, my boy. Remember that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">UPON a sudden Cartwright flung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand upward and snapped a finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thumb, as if he were throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">something over his right shoulder. Next</seg><seg type="columnLine">he blew out the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right, John!" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We can spring a surprise on Scala. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't mind talking it out in the dark?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's better," said Madame Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "Eugene Pai is not far away."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Headley knows you've left his bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low?" Cartwright asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose so," she answered, "though</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one may have seen me leave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll be best to warn him," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles, "for if he finds out you're gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">he may be anxious. We go past his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow anyhow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are we going?" asked Eade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Speak in a whisper," said Charles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got an idea. We want to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Scala is. Eugene Pai shall show us</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. Valerie has got pluck enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything. I'm going to send her back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pai with the news that I'm dead as</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutton. She'll act the part all right."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That will not be so difficult," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am already frightened. I fear for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll save him, Valerie," said Charles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I swear it. If we look in at Headley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the way, he'll want to come with us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he'll be a good man for the job; he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best tiger shot in this country, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few fellows I've ever heard of who will</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit down in a clearing and eat his lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the beaters drive a tiger up to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unless Liu Tang is with him, Scala has</seg><seg type="columnLine">got no one who would stand up to a Java</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparrow. We'll be three to one, and if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't get the old man away we're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what about Pai?" asked Eade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guess that fellow won't give much</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, but we've got to account for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead easy," Charles replied, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valerie does what I want. If Pai came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the jungle he must have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lantern with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is so," said madame. "He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lantern in his hand, but it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">alight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's bound to light it when he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the jungle; otherwise he won't be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see his hand in front of his face. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern is going to be our Star of Bethle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hem, John, though we've got to keep at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe distance, or Pai may hear us. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to leave the most important part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the business to you, Valerie. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out from Pai that we're on a path</seg><seg type="columnLine">that leads straight to the launch, or if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly catch sight of the lights of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch ahead, halt--to give us time to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to you. Say you're tired or too</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened. I'll back Headley and myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch that scoundrel alive, stop his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and tie him up to a tree."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ■'And then," asked Madame Scala,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously, "you save my father? Bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tista means what he says. My father is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no use to him now. You will have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cartwright answered her tenderly. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so dark that they could not see one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another; but John Eade suspected that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles had taken her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trust to me," said he. "God knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">how this night's work is going to end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But whatever happens, I won't fail you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valerie. I'd rather die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand," she said in a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet voice. "I will do what you wish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is the only thing--our only chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AT THAT "she left them without</seg><seg type="columnLine">another word. They heard her</seg><seg type="columnLine">run lightly and swiftly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps of the bungalow. On the veranda</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood listening, and presently could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear voices a little distance down the road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright grasped his cousin by an arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along," said he. "Valerie won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry. She'll give us all the time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want, but we've got to get a rope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that will do for a gag at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headley's."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went down the steps, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom walked on the stiff, short grass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiar wild grass of the Malay</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peninsula that stands upright like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristles of a wire brush. Pai and Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala were on the gravel roadway, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear their footsteps a little way</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was so dark that it was difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discern even the outline of the tall palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. Nothing else but the shape of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have told Cartwright when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Headley's bungalow, for the gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying in a bay of shrubs, was invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait here, John," said he. "I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in less than no time. We've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let Headley know; and besides, we want</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. If Liu Tang's with Scala, we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">our work cut out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about madame?" Eade asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She and Pai will be out of earshot in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds. Supposing we don't find them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Little chance of that," said the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"About three hundred yards farther on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this road ends at nothing. He'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go into the jungle, and he can't do that</seg><seg type="columnLine">without lighting up. Besides, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">propose to be away for long."</seg><seg type="columnLine">INDEED, he was back again before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade had had time to feel anxious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with him was Headley, who an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced that he had a loaded revolver, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">six foot length of rope and a thirst that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't swop for a hundred dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cartwright had already explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation to his manager. And the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them set off in Indian file, Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading, Headley next, but they had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone far before Charles came to a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had best wait here," said he. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where we are. There's the pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">apple plantation on this side of us where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground drops down toward the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we wait, sooner or later, we're bound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And ten to one I know the jungle path</seg><seg type="columnLine">he means to take," Headley whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Last week I shot the biggest pig there</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've ever seen in my life. I've got his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tusks at home. The old fellow looked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he could have ripped up an elephant."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're after something a damned sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dangerous than a wild boar now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Cartwright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If what I've heard's true," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, "the man's something worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scoundrel. By God, to think of selling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife to a Malay!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wouldn't be surprised at that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you knew him," said Charles. "Scala's</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">177</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extraordinary man. Vain as a pea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cock, cruel as a cat, clever as a monkey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't mind telling you that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened of him. There's no way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting at the brute. He's always so</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocksure of himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He won't be--after tonight," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headley. "By gad, look!" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's Pai!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, there was the glimmer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light some way below them on the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, evidently on the outskirts of a strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jungle that lay between the pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">apple plantation and the river. Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright still leading, they followed a cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivated furrow between two straight lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the low growing, slender leaved plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though they were now in the open, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as much as Eade could do to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the stumpy figure of Headley, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked in front of him. The light from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pai's lantern was more or less sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary, though it swung backward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, until suddenly it vanished, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear again a moment after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At. once Headley cut off in a beeline</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" he cried. "Follow me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can find the place in the dark."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW MINUTES afterward they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the jungle, Headley still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">• front. As Eade couldn't see an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch in front of him, he was given the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rope; and holding-jhis, he followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his two companions something after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of a blind man led by his dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had not gone far before the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lantern again came into view, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably nearer than when they had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">it before. Indeed, so close were they now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the man whom they were tracking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Eade was convinced that they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be heard, since time and again one or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other stumbled, and dry twigs were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually breaking under foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For this reason they slowed down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded with greater caution. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it safer to go forward with long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow strides--a gait more resembling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthy advance of some nocturnal beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of prey than the walk of a human being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Eade the path seemed endless, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow tunnel through a labyrinth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes their feet squelched in sticky</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud; while at other times they walked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">moss as soft and deep as eiderdown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour of it, and John Eade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet with perspiration which dripped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the hand that clenched the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his pistol. The other hand was sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">from holding the rope; and his eyes ached</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smarted from staring into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the light in front of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. Cartwright in a whisper told</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cousin to be careful. Still in single</seg><seg type="columnLine">file, they moved forward on tiptoe, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground like cats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of voices came to their ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The}' heard Madame Scala's voice dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly, and the very words she used.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There could be no doubt that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing her part to perfection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go no farther!" she cried. "I dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">not!" And then she groaned. "Oh, take</seg><seg type="columnLine">me back!" she said. "This is more than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little, fat Headley was life and soul in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business. Before Charles could stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he had gone down upon all fours</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had crawled off into the jungle under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a bit," Cartwright whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Headley means to cut him off. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll do it, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He allowed his manager the best part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a minute; and then, by giving a jerk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope, he intimated that he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eugene Pai was talking, protesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehemently and even using threats, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright caught him by the throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A hand was clapped upon the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth before he could cry out, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that very moment Headley took him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They tied a scarf tightly around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eugene Pai's mouth; and then, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands bound behind his back, they lashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the trunk of a tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a makeshift gag," Headley</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered in the man's ear, "but it'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve its purpose. You can't escape; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">178</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">I	warn you, it will be more than your life's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth to make any attempt to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. I'll settle with you afterward, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. You're not going to get off scot</seg><seg type="columnLine">free for this night's job, or I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference between Plymouth gin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lime juice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the first, Pai had made no at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to struggle. The lantern had fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len from his hand, the light had gone out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were in utter darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madame Scala grasped Eade by an arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Battista!" she whispered. "See! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is there! Those lights are on the launch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment Headley gave a grunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of satisfaction upon having disposed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their prisoner. When Cartwright asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headley whether they should relight the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern, Eade quickly interposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better not," said he. "The launch is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only just ahead of us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT a word being spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">they advanced in single file,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright again leading. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently they were able to see the dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage on either side of the path and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope-like creepers suspended in festoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the branches of the trees. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that they discovered that Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala had forced hei* way to the front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Headley took her by the shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held her back forcibly, yet almost play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is no place for a woman," said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an undertone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father!" she pleaded breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I daresay," said he. "But you can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. The fun may begin at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and if there's shooting we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a clear field of fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reluctantly she dropped back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed both Headley and Eade to pass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright was now some few yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. They could see his stooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure silhouetted against the lights on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch; and when he went down upon all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fours, they followed his example, to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on either side of him when he halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the trunk of a great tapang tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had fallen across the path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this they were in luck's way; for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree trunk was not ten yards from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank on the stream, which was but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet wide--only just wide enough, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accommodate the motor launch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amidships was a covered in saloon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which no full grown man could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood upright, with three large portholes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on either side of it, all of which were open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light within emanated from two</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric lamps; and so blinding was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightness that neither Cartwright nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions could see anything for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While they waited, they were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear distinctly the voices of the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the saloon, the one high pitched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">querulous, the other deep and quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By degrees John Eade became conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the details of his surroundings. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">first aware that there was a strip of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than a few inches in width, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the side of the launch and the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the creek. In the bows of the boat were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three men whose figures, being in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shade, were more or less indefinite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though from the squatting attitudes they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had assumed they were evidently natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the saloon the heads of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupants were visible, the one front face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other with his back to the porthole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first was the emaciated, wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance of an old man who had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most snow white hair that stood upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his forehead, a short untidy beard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white eyebrows and a mustache. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were deep sunken with black rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">round them--watery eyes with minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">irises. His complexion was a most un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy parchment color; and his should-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, round and stooping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the other man, little of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen but a pair of enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">square shoulders and very unusual black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curly hair that grew as thick as a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">mane over the nape of his neck. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently sitting upon a seat immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately underneath one of the portholes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was he who laughed. Such laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Eade had never heard in his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. It was laughter that suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">179</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panting of a hunting lion. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither mirth in it, nor satisfaction. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested nothing but brute, physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TURN OF THE SCALES</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR THE MOMENT there ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be no way of getting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board the launch without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. They lay there listening, not five</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away from the very man they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted, able to hear every word that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation they overheard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried on in English and French alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nately. In moments of extreme tension</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Le Camus lapsed into his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, though for the most part Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in English. And it was he who did</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the talking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you ever known me not mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I say?" they heard him ask. "But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend," he went on, in a voice meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be conciliatory, "do not distress your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. She will come back to me all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She may be here at any moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then?" the old man asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They could see. his face, scared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonized, like that of a man in torture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then?" said Scala. "To Singan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where once and for all I have done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rapped out these words with a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vicious glee; and they saw him throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his black curly head, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he went on. "I've had enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you. Valerie has done her best to fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. But I am neither blind nor a fool."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Camus was staring at him, hisjea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures immobile, his whole face like wax,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips parted. For a moment he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Diable!" he exclaimed, and then in</seg><seg type="columnLine">English. "You are not human."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am too clever to be that, perhaps,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Scala. "You are nothing to me but</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incumbrance. I shall be glad enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get rid of you. Valerie knows that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and therefore she will come back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will you do with her in Sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan?" Le Camus asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She shall have time to repent," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala. "For the rest of her life she can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find what consolation she can in a Malay</seg><seg type="columnLine">harem, and such sympathy as she can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the daughters of Malay fisherfolk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hainanese coolies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man must have flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his knees, for his face suddenly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, and they could see nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thin clasped hands. He spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">volubly, excitedly, and in such rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">French that of those who were listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Madame Scala could understand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During these brief moments she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced the most terrible anxiety, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most fearful suspense. She was powerless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help. She saw in torment--as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">often seen before--the old, broken man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was her-father. She knew the vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence of her husband's temperament and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his unscrupulousness. And yet all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time she had the strength of mind and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage not to cry out and disclose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that she and her companions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had crawled to Cartwright's side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the old man flung himself upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, the young planter extended a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grasped one of hers in a mute attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strengthen her fortitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Le Camus rose to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they could see the tear drops stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down his hollow cheeks, to hang like</seg><seg type="columnLine">like shining drewrops in his white un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kempt beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sheer physical exhaustion had at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">silenced the old man. He stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling, panting. Scala made a cluck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing noise with his tongue against the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mouth, much as one does to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">naughty child, suggesting regret more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than disapproval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pray calm yourself," said he. "I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">well understand that for you these</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes must seem unconscionably long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is but natural that you should be over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious. Permit me to recommend your</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual solace--the opium pipe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He appeared to lean forward to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">180</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">something from the table in front of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man hesitated a moment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then cried out in French.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never! Never again. The good God</seg><seg type="columnLine">will give me strength!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have flung the opium pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">through one of the portholes, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard something strike the trunk of a tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle at their backs. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">again Scala laughed softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How often have I heard you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that," he sighed. "My old friend, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">good resolutions grow monotonous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spare me the trouble of listening to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant. For once I have advised you for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own good. If you are to be a sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">man when Valerie arrives, I suggest you</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm your nerves."</seg><seg type="columnLine">LE CAMUS mastered himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty. They could see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face; he was moving his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewing the ends of his mustache. [Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken in English; and, as if he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could better control himself when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">used a language with which he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly familiar, the old man an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered in English, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if she does not come?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You die," said Scala quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For myself," sighed Le Camus, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be--release, escape from hell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scala repeated:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If she is not here by daybreak you</seg><seg type="columnLine">die.	But, as I have said, my friend, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no great cause to fear. For Valerie</seg><seg type="columnLine">will come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said this in such confidence, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such silken deliberation, in a voice so</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and yet so venomous, that the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who were listening took in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep breath and tightly gripped their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They could still see Le Camus. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was like that of a corpse, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">waxen, more still than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scala must have been looking the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, so sure of himself, so despising his</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotent and miserable victim that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected for the moment the most ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary precautions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For they saw Le Camus's face undergo</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rapid transformation. His numbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen features suddenly became alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With staring eyes and parted lips, his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression was that of a fiend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They saw him move forward quickly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spasmodic jerk of the body as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched something from the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realizing what was going to happen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who were hiding in the jungle could</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain in idleness no longer. Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala gave vent to a half suppressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek. Cartwright sprang to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headley appeared in the light streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one of the portholes of the launch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bright barrel of his nickel plated</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver gleaming in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment a deafening report</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to their ears. A revolver shot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined space of the little saloon, break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a thunderbolt upon the silence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle. Though they sprang on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost simultaneously, John Eade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to enter the saloon, where he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held Battista Scala dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man of Signan lay sprawled upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow red plush seat that ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of one side of the saloon under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portholes. His attitude was as un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural as his appearance was terrible; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one elbow was pulled in under him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shoulder was several inches higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the other, while the other arm hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His legs were stretched out underneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. He wore no collar and no tie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His great muscular neck was like that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild beast. It was clean through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the throat that old Le Camus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot him, the bullet having smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cervical vertebrae of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spine. Death had been instantaneous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Eade had never seen the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive; but Scala looked formidable even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. There was a certain massiveness</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the lower part of his face that, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of his good looks, gave him an ape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like appearance. His lips were drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, showing almost perfect teeth under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black mustache. Upon the hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was visible there was a ring on nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">every finger, including one in which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set an enormous emerald; and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">181</seg><seg type="columnLine">'feminine ornaments looked strange, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, upon one who had the limbs of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hercules.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Eade turned his attention to the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, his companions entered the saloon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he still held the smoking revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, Le Camus did not yet seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize what he had done. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless, astonished, as if unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe. He never looked away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala until his daughter flung her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his neck. And by then Headley</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the matter in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This can be hushed up," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll wire for Richardson, the district</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, to come here at once. He'll not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a case of it. We've evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough that this scoundrel has met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than his deserts."</seg><seg type="columnLine">OLD LE CAMUS, who had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tremble violently all over, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed by Charles Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his daughter to one of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins aft. Here madame remained with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, while her husband's body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped up in a blanket and laid out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon settee. By then Cartwright</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone ashore with Eade and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought on board Eugene Pai, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Headley decided to return to Nolak by</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of the river instead of the jungle, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he considered neither Madame Scala nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father in a fit condition to walk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could certainly not be left on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">the launch. They had some difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding their way in the darkness out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow backwater, but by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached the main river the full moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was up, and a few minutes afterward they</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchored ofT the Nolak jetties alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chauve-Souris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quental was hailed and told to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the three Malays who were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the launch. But Headley was determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find a safer asylum for Eugene Pai than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paddle-boat and a more trustworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jailer than Fernao Quental who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to have been the prisoner's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">federate in certain shady transactions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two rickshaw coolies were routed out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hovels at the foot of the hill on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was the Tamil compound; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were ordered to take Le Camus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his daughter straight back to Headley's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a note to Mrs. Headley, telling her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all was well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime the Telegu clerk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out of bed, and Eugene Pai was</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked up in one of the inner offices until</seg><seg type="columnLine">such time as he could be questioned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. It was about two o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning when Headley suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should all turn in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is nothing remarkable about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that all three should have entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten the very existence of Liu Tang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the last hour or so they had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite enough to occupy their minds; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, the after effect of acute tension is</seg><seg type="columnLine">as often as not a kind of mental negli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence. On the assumption that enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened that night, to last a life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they were inclined to believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole business was ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it so happened that Liu Tang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though long since incapable of wreaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala's vengeance on his enemies, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for them unconsciously some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the nature of a sinister surprise--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kind of gruesome, practical joke that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have afforded the astute, cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">blooded Chinese no little satisfaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THREE MEN were walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast on the roadway and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing every aspect of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange events of the night, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to Cartwright's bungalow. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped at the foot of the veranda steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say good night to Headley, and John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade had actually climbed half way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stairs, when he let out an oath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang down to the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" he exclaimed, pointing up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to the right of the house. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half naked, rigid body was sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended between earth and sky, between</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven and hell--a yellow corpse that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked to be floating in the moonlight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like some great Oriental gargoyle, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">182</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARLES GILSON</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper part of the man's body protruded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff and horrid, from the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow from under the eaves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attap roof, at the point where the canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling of the front room ended at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he was dead there could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, for the moonlight was full upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pale, gleaming body. Though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater part of his arms were visible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these appeared to be pinned to his sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sharp angle formed by the beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">that supported the roof and the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">rafter that continued over the veranda.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His head had fallen downward and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a little to the right, which made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it appear as if he was endeavoring to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">round the corner into the veranda itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cartwright was the first to find his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you make of that?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "It's Liu Tang all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he's dead," said Headley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's only one way to answer that</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, Charles, and that's to get him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had some difficulty in doing this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was a job none too pleasant. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eade, standing upon the top rail that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the veranda, was able to push the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body* away from Him, until it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer wedged in the acute angle formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rafter and the beam. Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright in the meantime had climbed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little window at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting-room; and standing upon the sill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this, he was able to grasp the body with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand and jerk it clear of the attap</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. It came away with several dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">nipa leaves of which the thatch was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, as well as with a portion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas ceiling that must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten with damp. It fell with a dull thud</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the close cut grass of the little lawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headley had pretty thoroughly examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body with the help of his electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch by the time that his two com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions joined him; and he had found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Liu Tang's clenched fists Charles</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright's razor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No signs of violence here," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked. "There's rigor mortis and he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone cold. He must have been dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time. By gad, Charles," he sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly exclaimed, "you haven't got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildcat in your bungalow by any chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Cartwright. "There's one</seg><seg type="columnLine">next door though. Beverley says it keeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">him awake half the night tearing up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the canvas ceiling after the rats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lizards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Headley thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's just it, Beverley's rats have all</seg><seg type="columnLine">migrated to you. And you've got a worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodger up there in that roof than a wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat. A snake, and a venomous one, too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright whistled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right," said he. "That's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">got him. But when did this happen?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Must have been in the earlier part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night," said Eade. "You remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pai told Madame Scala that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find you with your throat cut?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean he was in the roof all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Eade. "Your boy, Ah</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yen, told us that he found Pai standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the veranda with his body all twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, looking as if he'd seen a ghost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, I guess he went up there after you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, to see what he could find out, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the shock of his life. Liu Tang saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and spoke to him. Somewhere at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the veranda there must be a gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the roof and the wall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is," said Charles. "I see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mean. Pai got his orders from Liu</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tang, who sent him down the river to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scala. Directly he found Madame Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board the Chauve-Souris, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang must have guessed that Scala</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself wouldn't be far behind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's about it," said Eade. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow lay up here determined to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">his job properly with your own razor be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he joined Scala. He played his cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncommonly well, too; for if madame had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found us both with our throats cut, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">very little doubt that by now she would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">well on her way back to Singan. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember we went out of the bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a pretty great hurry, and we naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">never looked back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE THRALDOM OF SINGAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">183</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He wasn't there when we went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed," said Charles, "before I put out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. I'd swear to that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Eade. "It was when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were waiting for him, pretending to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep--and I don't mind confessing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just about as nervous as I've ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in my life--that that snake got him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made a better and a quicker job of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, Charles, than you and I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FOLLOWING DAY, the evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence given by Mr. Eugene Pai bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the truth of Eade's conclusions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pai declared that at about midday the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had been out on the bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">road. He had seen Madame Scala break</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the jungle, exchange a few words</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a Chinese coolie on the pineapple</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantation and then make straight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartwright's bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had thought he had recognized her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he could scarcely credit his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A European lady, so scantily attired, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered as if she had reached the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage of physical exhaustion, was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object quite sufficient in itself to arouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">his curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had followed her to the bungalow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had waited outside until Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wright himself returned. By then, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made quite sure that it really was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady he had known in Singan. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Cartwright say that he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take her to Headley's; and when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast was clear he had gone into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow to try to find out what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could from Ah Yen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been startled by a voice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he recognized at once. When he was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda, he had seen Liu Tang's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">up above him, at the point where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attap roof crossed the outer wall. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liu Tang had told him exactly what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do: He was to take a canoe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go downstream, and sooner or later he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to come across Scala, to whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to give the news that Liu Tang had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been too late that morning to do the job</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had brought him to Nolak. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing would be done all right that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was of the utmost importance that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eugene Pai, should tell Scala that</seg><seg type="columnLine">madame had been placed in the charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">t he wife of the manager of the estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When he had heard the evidence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headley looked across at Eade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks as if we've got to thank that</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake for a lot," said he. "At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Charles, you'll have to pull out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that canvas ceiling to get rid of the brute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A wildcat's preferable." And by way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">explaining the matter to Eade, he added.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In this part of the world, sir, you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have one or the other. It's a choice be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween two evils. That's how we live out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seems to me," said John Eade, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">on occassions there're more than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">evils to choose from."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe you're right," Headley</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed, and then shouted for stingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT HONESTLY warms my heart, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes me feel that Adventure is doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a truly great work in the world, to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way in which scores--on a bad break,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands--of readers come right up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hesitation, and criticize any mistake in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our pages.

The natives themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate it fiercely and to not like even to be called</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Indians," preferring "natives" if you have to men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion them as a class by themselves. I have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">great numbers of them intelligent, loyal, conscien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious and even artistic.

A native housekeeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cook who has had proper opportunity to learn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a household martinet and is widely appreciated</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a kitchen adornment.

Thank you very much.--donald</seg><seg type="columnLine">mackay, U. S. Naval Hospital, C-S, Brooklyn, N. Y.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dear Mr. MacKay:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adventure has delegated three of us to answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">your fine letter about suggesting something to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for on your contemplated cruise. To me falls the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South American portion, or certain parts of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast continent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your idea brings back to me an idea I had, years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. I had conceived making the overland trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through Central America from Mexico to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how the work on the Panama Canal was pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressing. The C. A. country was then, I believe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much wilder than it is now. There were fewer rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads and highways than there are now--and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not have them in abundance at this very time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially of the north and south variety. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">most all run east and west, what few there are.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I hit out. I made fair time through Mexico</seg><seg type="columnLine">down as far as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the general manager of the Pan-American</seg><seg type="columnLine">Railroad for a pass down to the Guatemalan border.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a Mr. Wise from Texas. He insisted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving me a return pass, saying the trip I was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on was impossible and I couldn't even get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the end of the line to Guatemala City. I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the return pass and used it as a passport when I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked up in a thatched fort on the border. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers could not read and I told them it was a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of passporte, and they let me go. I was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful wreck when I finally hit the Canal Zone. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had forded and swum dozens of rivers, some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally crawling with alligators and dotted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimming sharks. I worked a while for the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and then hit South America. I made some</seg><seg type="columnLine">long walks in that country ^and I fear me I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never recover from the effects of a few of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I can sit right here and visualize the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">S. A. coast all the way around from Panama back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Colon. I ought to be able to do that, for not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only have I seen the coast for long stretches where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hiked, but I have answered literally thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions about it in past years. I can also visualize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire topography of the S. A. continent in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunk and in small portions. I can take a pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jab at a map and say "there" and "there" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"there" you will find something. It's a danged big</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are not over a hundred real Indians left</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there. There are just a few stops on the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">where something might be seen on the Pacific side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These are (I am omitting the big ports): Salaverry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go out to the Chan Chan ruins and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">enquiry about the general digging that has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done in the past and try to spot the place where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Fish was dug out. The Big Fish was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. The little one ran to about $8,000,000.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, for my part, I would like to know if the Peru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vian Government will allow treasure and curios to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be carried out. I have heard a rumor that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have shut down on the permits. The old aqueduct</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the modern sugar mill that's using it and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general dope on the realm of old Chimu the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">should give material for a magazine article or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper supplement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is another similar but different ruin near</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lima, known as Pachacamac. These are not Inca</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins. They are contemporaneous with the Incas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were subjugated by them. (I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether you can follow me or not, I'm getting all</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out.) Pachacamac is fairly well known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">archaeologists. I'm thinking about the Big Fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I mention the Chan Chan ruins at Trujillo a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance by rail from Salaverry. Up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highlands of Peru are the pre-Incan Cyclopean</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins and the Incan ruins in various places. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">are pretty well known. The same people put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">those big stones there that put them up on Easter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island. Just who they were no man can ever sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mise. Along down the top of the Andes we have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of volcanoes and high peaks all the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Ecuador to Chile. The Quechua Indians (sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects of the Incan kings) have been domesticated for</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer than we have.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In southern Patagonia the nomad Indians used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make their long circle up and back to the Straits</seg><seg type="columnLine">during a year. I don't imagine many of them are</seg><seg type="columnLine">left now. There is a Welsh colony on the Atlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the Chubut River. There isn't much to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the way up to B. A. That's a big city with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the word implies. Same all the way up to Rio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The things to see are back inland. There is the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern pine forest in Brazil, the coffee ranches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">big cattle also in the south, and back behind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unknown country to the Andes. From Rio all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way north there are rivers that might be inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting to travel up. Then the Amazon is a 2,500-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile trip to Iquitos. Any of the river trips up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iquitos put you into wild country. But you are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lugger and won't be up there, possibly. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the shoulder of S. A. you veer west around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Guianas. Some gold up-country in all three</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some diamonds in British Guiana. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly a connection somewhere between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond fields of Brazil and this one. Trouble to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow it is the heavy jungle. Back around Vene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zuela you might make a trip or two inland to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">llano country. The "poets" of the plains do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">herding. Then along the Colombian coast. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honey Shark Point you hit the San Bias coast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are much tamer than they used to be and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can stop in their villages if you get back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your boat before dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only thing I ever heard of being found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">South America that excited undue comment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was in Panama. A sailor claimed he found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehistoric horse and killed it with a club. A quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of a million dollars was spent by an expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to the spot--and failed to find it.
