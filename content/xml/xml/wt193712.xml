Civiliza- </p><p>tion began in the Nile Valley centuries ago. Where </p><p>did its first builders acquire their astounding wisdom that </p><p>started man on his upward climb? Beginning with naught </p><p>they overcame nature’s forces and gave the world its first </p><p>sciences and arts. Did their knowledge come from a race now </p><p>submerged beneath the sea, or were they touched with Infinite </p><p>inspiration? From what concealed source came the wisdom </p><p>that produced such characters as Amenhotep IV, Leonardo da </p><p>Vinci, Isaac Newton, and a host of others? </p><p>Today it is known that they discovered and learned to inter- </p><p>pret certain Secret Methods for the development of their inner </p><p>power of mind. They learned to command the inner forces </p><p>within their own beings, and to master life. This secret art of </p><p>living has been preserved and handed down throughout the </p><p>ages. Today it is extended to those who dare to use its pro- </p><p>found principles to meet and solve the problems of life in </p><p>these complex times. </p><p>This Sealed Book—FREE </p><p>Has life brought you that personal satisfaction, the sense of achieve- </p><p>ment and happiness that you desire? If not. it is your duty to your- </p><p>self to learn about this rational method of applying natural laws for </p><p>the mastery of life. To the thoughtful person it is obvious that every- </p><p>one cannot be entrusted with an intimate knowledge of the mysteries of </p><p>life, for everyone is not capable of properly using it. But if you are </p><p>one of those possessed of a true desire to forge ahead and wish to make </p><p>use of the subtle influences of life, the Rosicrucians (not a religious or- </p><p>ganization) will send you A Sealed Book of explanation without obli- </p><p>gation. This Sealed Book tells how you, in the privacy of your own </p><p>home, without interference with your personal affairs or manner of liv- </p><p>ing, may receive these secret teachings.

And while she was the A three-day northeast gale was ham- </p><p>most utterly damnable woman in all the	mering at the coast. It was late in the</p><p>world, at the same time, in my opinion,	fall of the year, and cold as only our</p><p>644 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>North Atlantic coast can very well be, </p><p>but in the very midst of the tempest I </p><p>became afflicted with a mild form of </p><p>claustrophobia. So I donned sea-boots, oil- </p><p>skins and sou’wester hat, and sallied </p><p>forth for a walk along the shore. </p><p> My little cottage stood at the top of a</p><p>high cliff. There was a broad, safe path </p><p>running down to the beach, and down it </p><p>I hurried. The short winter day was even </p><p>then drawing to a close, and after I’d </p><p>trudged a quarter of a mile along the </p><p>shore, I decided I’d best return to my </p><p>comfortable fireside. The walk had at </p><p>least given me a good appetite. </p><p> There was none of the usual lingering</p><p>twilight of a clear winter evening. Dark- </p><p>ness fell so abruptly I was glad I’d </p><p>brought along a powerful flashlight. I’d </p><p>almost reached the foot of my path up </p><p>the cliff when I halted, incredulous, yet </p><p>desiring to make sure. </p><p> I turned the ray of the flashlight on</p><p>the great comber just curling to break on </p><p>the shore, and held the light steady, my </p><p>breath gasping in my throat. Such a thing </p><p>as I thought I’d seen couldn't be—yet </p><p>it was! </p><p> I started to run to the rescue, and</p><p>could not move a foot. A power stronger </p><p>than my own will held me immovable. I </p><p>could only watch, spellbound. And even </p><p>as I stared, that gigantic comber gently </p><p>subsided, depositing its precious living </p><p>burden on the sands as softly as any </p><p>nurse laying a babe into a cradle. </p><p> Waist-deep in a smother of foam she</p><p>stood for a brief second, then calmly </p><p>waded ashore and walked with free </p><p>swinging stride straight up the beam of </p><p>my flashlight to where I stood. </p><p> Regardless of the hellish din and tur-</p><p>moil of the tempest, I thrilled, old as I </p><p>am, at the superb loveliness of this most </p><p>amazing specimen of flotsam ever a rag- </p><p>ing sea cast ashore within memory of </p><p>man. </p><p> Never a shred of clothing masked her</p><p>matchless body, yet her flesh glowed </p><p>rosy-white, when by all natural laws it </p><p>should have been blue-white from the icy </p><p>chill of wintry seas. </p><p> "Well!” I exclaimed. "Where did you</p><p>come from? Are you real—or am I seeing </p><p>that which is not?” </p><p> "I am real,” replied a clear, silvery</p><p>voice. "And I came from out there.” An </p><p>exquisitely molded arm flung a gesture </p><p>toward the raging ocean. "The ship I </p><p>was on was sinking, so I stripped off my </p><p>garb, flung myself on Ran's bosom, and </p><p>Ran’s horses gave me a most magnificent </p><p>ride! But well for you that you stood </p><p>still as I bade you, while I walked ashore. </p><p>Ran is an angry god, and seldom well- </p><p>disposed toward mortals.” </p><p> "Ran?” The sea-god of the old Norse</p><p>vikings! What strange woman was this, </p><p>who talked of "Ran” and his "horses,” </p><p>the white-maned waves of old ocean? </p><p>But then I bethought me of her naked </p><p>state in diat unholy tempest. </p><p> "Surely you must be Ran’s daughter,"</p><p>I said. "That reef is ten miles off land! </p><p>Come—I have a house near by, and com- </p><p>forts—you cannot stand here.” </p><p> "Lead, and I will follow,” she replied</p><p>simply. </p><p>She went up that path with greater </p><p>ease than I, and walked companion- </p><p>ably beside me from path-top to house, </p><p>although she made no talk. Oddly, I </p><p>felt that she was reading me, and that </p><p>what she read gave her comfort. </p><p> When I opened the door, it seemed</p><p>as if she held back for a merest moment. </p><p> "Enter,” I bade her, a bit testily. "I</p><p>should think you’d had enough of this </p><p>weather by now!” </p><p> She bowed her head with a natural</p><p>stateliness which convinced me that she </p><p>was no common person, and murmured </p><p>something too low for me to catch, but </p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>645 </p><p>the accents had a distinct Scandinavian </p><p>trend. </p><p> "What did you say?” I queried, for I</p><p>supposed she’d spoken to me. </p><p> "I invoked the favor of the old gods</p><p>on die hospitable of heart, and on the </p><p>sheltering roof tree," she replied. Then </p><p>she crossed my threshold, but she readied </p><p>out her arm and rested her shapely white </p><p>hand lightly yet firmly on my left fore- </p><p>arm as she stepped within. </p><p> She went direct to the big stove, whidi</p><p>was glowing dull-red, and stood there, </p><p>smiling slightly, calm, serene, wholly </p><p>ignoring her nakedness, obviously enjoy- </p><p>ing the warmth, and not by a single </p><p>shiver betraying that she had any chill </p><p>as result of exposure. </p><p> "I think you need this," I said, proffer-</p><p>ing a glass of brandy. ''There’s time </p><p>enough for exdianging names and giving </p><p>explanations, later,” I added. "But right </p><p>now, I’ll try and find something for you </p><p>to put on. I have no women’s things in </p><p>the house, as I live alone, but will do the </p><p>best I can.” </p><p> I passed into my bedroom, laid out a</p><p>suit of pajamas and a heavily quilted </p><p>bathrobe, and returned to the living-room </p><p>where she stood. </p><p> "You are a most disconcertingly beau-</p><p>tiful young woman,” I stated bluntly; </p><p>‘which you know quite well without </p><p>being told. But doubtless you will feel </p><p>more at ease if you go in there and don </p><p>some things I’ve laid out for you. When </p><p>you come out, I’ll get some supper </p><p>ready.” </p><p> She was back instantly, still unclad. I</p><p>stared, wonderingly. </p><p> "Those things did not fit,” she</p><p>shrugged. "And that heavy robe—in this </p><p>warm house?” </p><p> "But-” I began.</p><p> "But—this,” she smiled, catching up</p><p>a crimson silk spread embroidered in </p><p>gold, which covered a sandalwood table </p><p>I’d brought from the orient many years </p><p>before. A couple of swift motions and </p><p>the gorgeous thing became a wondrous </p><p>robe adorning her lovely figure, clinging, </p><p>and in some subtle manner hinting at the </p><p>flawless splendor of her incomparable </p><p>body. A long narrow scarf of black silk </p><p>whereon twisted a silver dragon was </p><p>whipped from its place on a shelf and </p><p>transposed into a sash from her swelling </p><p>breasts to her sloping hips, bringing out </p><p>more fully every exquisite curve of her </p><p>slender waist and torso—and she smiled </p><p>again. </p><p> "Now,” she laughed softly, "am I</p><p>still a picture for your eyes? I hope so, </p><p>for you have befriended me this night— </p><p>I who sorely need a friend; and it is such </p><p>a little thing I can do—making myself </p><p>pleasing in your sight. </p><p> "And because you have holpen me”—</p><p>I stared at the ardiaic form she used— </p><p>"and will continue to aid and befriend </p><p>(for so my spirit tells me), I will love </p><p>you always, love you as Ragnar Wave- </p><p>Flame loved Jarl Wulf Red-Brand . . * </p><p>as a younger sister, or a dutiful niece.” </p><p> "Yet of her it is told,” I interrupted,</p><p>deliberately speaking Swedish and watch- </p><p>ing keenly to see the effect, "that the love </p><p>given by the foam-born Sea-Witch </p><p>brought old Earl Wulf of the Red-Sword </p><p>but little luck, and that not of a sort </p><p>desired by most men!” </p><p> "That is ill said,” she retorted. "His</p><p>fate was from the Noms, as is the fate </p><p>of all. Not hers the fault of his doom, </p><p>and when his carles within the hour cap- </p><p>tured his three slayers, she took red </p><p>vengeance. With her own foam-white </p><p>hands she flayed them alive, and covered </p><p>their twitching bodies with salt ere she </p><p>placed the old Jarl in his long-ship and </p><p>set it afire. And she sailed with that old </p><p>man on his last seafaring, steering his </p><p>blazing dragon-ship out of the stead, </p><p>singing of his great deeds in life, that </p><p>646 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>the heroes in Valhalla might know wTho </p><p>honored them by his coming.” </p><p> She paused, her superb bosom heaving</p><p>tumultuously. Then with a visible effort </p><p>she calmed herself. </p><p> “But you speak my tongue, and know</p><p>the old tales of the Skalds. Are you, </p><p>then, a Swede?” </p><p> "I speak the tongue, and the old tales</p><p>of the Skalds, the ancient minstrels, I </p><p>learned from my grandmother, who was </p><p>of your race.” </p><p> "Of my race?” her tone held a curious</p><p>inflection. "Ah, yes! All women are of </p><p>one race . . . perhaps.” </p><p> ‘'But I spoke of supper,” I said, mov-</p><p>ing toward the kitchen. </p><p> "But—no!” She barred my progress</p><p>with one of her lovely hands laid flat </p><p>against my chest. "It is not meet and </p><p>fitting, Jarl Wulf, that you should cook </p><p>for me, like any common house-carle! </p><p>Rather, let your niece, Heldra, prepare </p><p>for you a repast.” </p><p> " 'Heldra? That, then, is your name?”</p><p>"Heldra Helstrom, and your loving </p><p>niece,” she nodded. </p><p> "But why call me Jarl Wulf?” I de-</p><p>manded, curious to understand. She had </p><p>bestowed the name seriously, rather than </p><p>in playful banter. </p><p> "Jarl Wulf you were, in a former</p><p>life,” she asserted flatly. "I knew you on </p><p>the shore, even before Ran’s horse stood </p><p>me on my feet!” </p><p> "Surely, then, you must be Ragnar</p><p>Wave-Flame born again,” I countered. </p><p> "How may that be?” she retorted.</p><p>"Ragnar Wave-Flame never died; and </p><p>surely I do not look that old! The sea- </p><p>born witch returned to the sea-caves </p><p>whence she came, when the dragon-ship </p><p>burned out. . . . But ask me not of my- </p><p>self, now.</p><p> "Yet one thing more I will say: The</p><p>warp and woof of this strange pattern </p><p>wherein we both are depicted was woven </p><p>of the Norns ere the world began. We </p><p>have met before—we meet again, here </p><p>and now—we shall meet yet again; but </p><p>how, and when, and where, I may not </p><p>say.” </p><p> "Of a truth, you are 'fey’,” I muttered.</p><p>"At times—I am,” she assented. Then </p><p>her wondrous sapphire eyes gleamed </p><p>softly into my own hard gray eyes, her </p><p>smile was tender, wistful, womanly, and </p><p>my doubts were dissipated like wisps of </p><p>smoke. Yet I shook an admonitory fore- </p><p>finger at her: </p><p> "Witch at least I know you to be,” I</p><p>said in mock harshness. "Casting glamyr </p><p>on an old man.” </p><p> "No need for witchery,” she laughed.</p><p>"All women possess that power!” </p><p>During the "repast” she spread be- </p><p>fore me, I told her that regardless </p><p>of who I might have been in a dim and </p><p>remote past of which I had no memory, </p><p>in this present life I was plain John </p><p>Craig, retired professor of anthropology, </p><p>edinology and archeology, and living on </p><p>a very modest income. I explained that </p><p>while I personally admired her, and she </p><p>wTas welcome to remain in my home for </p><p>ever, yet in the village near by were curi- </p><p>ous minds, and gossiping tongues, and </p><p>evil thoughts a-plenty, and if I were to </p><p>tell the truth of her arrival- </p><p> "But I have nowhere to go, and none</p><p>save you to befriend me; all I loved or </p><p>owned is out there.” Again she indicated </p><p>the general direction of the reef. "And </p><p>you say that I may remain here, indefi- </p><p>nitely? I will be known as your niece, </p><p>Heldra, no? Surely, considering the dif- </p><p>ferences in our age and appearance, there </p><p>can be no slander.” </p><p> Her eyes said a thousand things no</p><p>words could convey. There w-as eager- </p><p>ness, sadness, and a strange tender- </p><p>ness. ... I came to an abrupt decision. </p><p>After all, whose business was it? . . .</p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>647 </p><p> "I am alone in the world, as you are,”</p><p>I said gravely. ' As my niece, Heldra, </p><p>you shall remain. If you will write out a </p><p>list of a woman’s total requirements in </p><p>wearing-apparel, I will send away as soon </p><p>as possible and have them shipped here </p><p>in haste. I am old, as all can see, and I </p><p>do not think any sensible persons will </p><p>suspect aught untoward in your making </p><p>your home with me. And I will think up </p><p>a plausible story which will satisfy the </p><p>minds of fools without telling, in reality, </p><p>anything.” </p><p> Our repast ended, we arose from the</p><p>table and returned to the living-room. I </p><p>filled and lighted a nargilyeh, a three- </p><p>stemmed water-pipe, and settled myself </p><p>in my armchair. She helped herself to a </p><p>cigarette from a box on the table, then </p><p>stretched her long, slender body at full </p><p>length on my divan, in full relaxation of </p><p>comfort. </p><p> I told her enough of myself and my</p><p>forebears to insure her being able to carry </p><p>out Hie fiction of being my niece. And in </p><p>return I learned mighty little about her. </p><p>But what she did tell me was sufficient. </p><p>I never was unduly curious about other </p><p>people’s business. </p><p> Unexpectedly, and most impolitely, I</p><p>yawned. Yet it was natural enough, and </p><p>it struck me that she needed a rest, if any- </p><p>one ever did. But before I could speak, </p><p>she forestalled me. </p><p> With a single graceful movement she</p><p>rose from her reclining posture and came </p><p>and stood before me within easy arm’s- </p><p>reach. Two swift motions, and her su- </p><p>perb body flashed rosy-white, as nude as </p><p>when she waded ashore. </p><p> The crimson silken spread she’d worn</p><p>as regally as any robe was laid at my feet </p><p>with a single gesture, the black scarf went </p><p>across my knees, and the glorious creature </p><p>was kneeling before me in attitude of ab- </p><p>solute humility. Before I could remon- </p><p>strate or bid her arise, her silvery voice </p><p>rang softly, solemnly, like a muted </p><p>trumpet:</p><p> "Thus, naked and with empty hands,</p><p>out of the wintry seas in a twilight gray </p><p>and cold, on a night of storm I came. </p><p>And you lighted a beacon for my tired </p><p>eyes, that I might see my way ashore. </p><p>You led me up the cliff and to your hos- </p><p>pitable hearth, and in your kindly heart </p><p>you had already given the homeless a </p><p>home. </p><p> "And now, kneeling naked before you,</p><p>as I came, I place my hands between your </p><p>hands—thus—and all that I am, and such </p><p>service as I can render, are yours, hand- </p><p>fasted.” </p><p> I stared, well-nigh incredulous. In ef-</p><p>fect, in the old Norse manner, she was </p><p>declaring herself to all intents and pur- </p><p>poses my slave! But her silvery voice </p><p>went on: </p><p> "And now, I rise and cover myself</p><p>again with the mantle of your bounty, </p><p>that you may know me, indeed your niece, </p><p>as Jarl Wulf knew Ragnar Wave-Flame!” </p><p> "Truly,” I gasped in amazement when</p><p>I could catch my breath, "you are a </p><p>strange mixture of the ancient days and </p><p>this modern period. I have known you </p><p>but for a few hours, yet I feel toward </p><p>you as that old Jarl must have felt toward </p><p>that other sea-witch, unless indeed you </p><p>and she are one!” </p><p> "Almost,” she replied a trifle somber-</p><p>ly. "At least, she was my ancestress!” </p><p>Then she added swiftly: "Do not mis- </p><p>understand. Leman to the old Jarl she </p><p>never was. But later, after he went to </p><p>Valhalla, in the sea-girt isle where she </p><p>dwelt she mated with a young viking </p><p>whom Ran had cast ashore sorely wound- </p><p>ed and insensible. She nursed him back </p><p>to life for sake of his beauty, and he made </p><p>love to her. </p><p> "But he soon tired of her and her</p><p>witch ways; wherefore, in wrath she gave </p><p>him back to Ran—and he was seen no </p><p>648 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>more. Of that mating was bom a daugh- </p><p>ter, also given to Ran, who pitied her </p><p>and bore her to an old man and his wife </p><p>whose steading was nigh to the mouth of </p><p>a fjord; and they, being childless, called </p><p>her Ranhild, and reared her as their </p><p>daughter. In course of time, she wed, </p><p>and bore three tall sons and a daugh- </p><p>ter. . . . </p><p> "That was long and long ago—yet I</p><p>have dived into Ragnar’s hidden sea-cave </p><p>and talked with Ragnar Wave-Flame face </p><p>to face. All one night I lay in her arms, </p><p>and in the dawning she breathed her </p><p>breath on my brow, lips, and bosom; and </p><p>all that following day she talked and I </p><p>listened, and much I learned of the wis- </p><p>dom that an elder world termed witch- </p><p>craft/’ </p><p> For a moment she lapsed into silence.</p><p>Then she leaned forward, laid her shape- </p><p>ly, cool hands on my temples and kissed </p><p>me on my furrowed old forehead, very </p><p>solemnly, yet with ineffable gentleness. </p><p> "And now,” she murmured, "ask me</p><p>never again aught concerning myself, I </p><p>pray you; for I have told all I may, and </p><p>further questioning will drive me back </p><p>to the sea. And I would not have that </p><p>happen—yet!” </p><p> Without another word she turned,</p><p>flung herself at full length again on the </p><p>divan, and, like any tired child, went in- </p><p>stantly to sleep. Decidedly, I thought, </p><p>this "niece” of mine was not as are other </p><p>women; and later I found that she pos- </p><p>sessed certain abilities it is well for the </p><p>world that few indeed can wield. </p><p>She gave me anodier proof of that be- </p><p>lief, by demonstrating her unholy </p><p>powers, on the night of the next full </p><p>moon after her arrival. </p><p> It was her custom of an evening to ar-</p><p>ray herself as she had done on her first </p><p>night—in crimson robe and black sash </p><p>and naught else, despite the fact that her </p><p>wardrobe which I had ordered from the </p><p>great city forty miles away contained all</p><p>any woman’s heart could wish for. But </p><p>I admit I enjoyed seeing her in that semi- </p><p>barbaric attire. </p><p> At times she would sit on the arm of</p><p>my chair, often with her smooth cool </p><p>cheek laid against my rough old face, and </p><p>her exquisitely modeled arm curved about </p><p>my leathery old neck. The first time she </p><p>had done that, I had demanded ironi- </p><p>cally: </p><p> "Witch, are you making love to me?”</p><p>But her sighing, wistful reply had dis- </p><p>armed me, and likewise had brought a </p><p>lump into my throat. </p><p> "Nay! Not that, O Jarl from of old!</p><p>But—I never knew a father.” </p><p> "Nor I a fair daughter,” I choked.</p><p>And thereafter, when that mood was </p><p>upon her I indulged in no more ironies, </p><p>and we’d sit for hours, neither speaking, </p><p>engrossed in thoughts for which there are </p><p>no words. But on the night whereof I </p><p>write, she pressed her scarlet lips to my </p><p>cheek, and I asked jestingly: </p><p> "Is there sometiiing you want, Hel-</p><p>dra?” </p><p> "There is,” she replied gravely. "Will</p><p>you get a boat—one with oars and a sail, </p><p>but no engine? Ran hates those.” </p><p> "But surely you do not want it now,</p><p>tonight, do you?” </p><p> "Yes, if you will be so kind to me.”</p><p>"You must have a very good reason, or </p><p>you’d not ask,” I said. "I’ll go and get a </p><p>centerboard dory and bring it to the beach </p><p>at the foot of the cliff path. It’s clear </p><p>weather, and the sea is calm, with but a </p><p>moderate breeze blowing; yet it is colder </p><p>on the water than you imagine, so you’d </p><p>best bundle up warmly.” </p><p> "You will hasten,” she implored anx-</p><p>iously. </p><p> "Surely,” I nodded.</p><p> I went out and down to the wharves in</p><p>the village, where I kept the boat I said </p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>649 </p><p>I’d get. But when I beached the dory at </p><p>foot of the path I stared, swearing softly </p><p>under my breath. Not one stitch of ap- </p><p>parel did that witch have on, save the </p><p>crimson silk robe and black sash she’d </p><p>worn when I left the cottage! </p><p> "Do you want to freeze?” I wras pro-</p><p>voked, I admit. "The very sight of you </p><p>dressed like that gives me the shivers!” </p><p>"Neither you nor I will be cold this </p><p>night,” she laughed. "Isn’t it glorious? </p><p>And this is a good boat you brought. </p><p>Please, let me sail it, and ask me no ques- </p><p>tions.” </p><p> She took the tiller, hauled in on the</p><p>sheet; the sail filled, and she began sing- </p><p>ing, with a queer, wild strain running </p><p>through her song. That dory fairly flew </p><p>—and I swear there was not enough wind </p><p>to drive us at such speed. </p><p> Finally I saw something I didn’t ad-</p><p>mire. No one does, who dwells on that </p><p>part of the coast. </p><p> "Are you crazy, girl?” I demanded</p><p>sharply. "That reef is dead ahead! Can’t </p><p>you see the breakers?” </p><p> "Why, so it is—the reef! And am I</p><p>to be affrighted by a few puny breakers? </p><p>Nay, it is in the heart of those breakers </p><p>that I wish to be! But you—have you </p><p>fear, O Jarl Wulf?” </p><p> I suspected from her tone that the</p><p>witch was laughing at me; so I subsided, </p><p>but fervently wished that I’d not been so </p><p>indulgent of her whim for a moonlight </p><p>sail on a cold winter’s night. </p><p> Then we hit those breakers—or rather,</p><p>w'e didn’t! For they seemed to part as </p><p>the racing dory sped into them, making a </p><p>smooth clear lane of silvery glinting wa- </p><p>ter over which W'e glided as easily as if </p><p>on a calm inland mill-pond! </p><p> "Drop the sail and unstep the mast,”</p><p>she called suddenly. </p><p> I was beyond argument, and obeyed</p><p>dumbly, like any boat-carle of the olden</p><p>days. </p><p> "Now, take to the oars,” she directed,</p><p>"and hold the boat just hereabouts for a </p><p>while,” and even as I slid the oars into </p><p>the oarlocks she made that swift move- </p><p>ment of hers and stood nude, the loveliest </p><p>sight that grim, ship-shattering, life-de- </p><p>stroying reef had ever beheld. </p><p> Suddenly she flung up both shapely</p><p>white arms with a shrill, piercing cry, </p><p>thrice repeated. Then without a w’ord </p><p>she w’ent overside in a long clean dive, </p><p>with never a splash to show where she’d </p><p>hit the water. </p><p> "Hold tjie boat about here for a</p><p>while,” she’d bidden me! All I'd ever </p><p>loved in this world was somewhere down </p><p>below, in the hellish cross-currents of that </p><p>icy water! I’d hold that boat there, if </p><p>need were, in the teeth of a worse tempest </p><p>than raged the night she came to me. </p><p>She’d find me waiting. And if she never </p><p>came up, I’d hold that boat there till its </p><p>planks rotted and I joined her in the </p><p>frigid depths. </p><p> It seemed an eternity, and I know that</p><p>it was an hour ere a glimmer of white </p><p>appeared beneath the surface. Then her </p><p>shapely arm emerged and her hand </p><p>grasped the gunwale, her regal head </p><p>broke water, she blew like a porpoise; </p><p>then she laughed in clear ringing tri- </p><p>umph. </p><p> "You old dearling!” she cried in her</p><p>ardiaic Norse. "Did I seem long gone? </p><p>The boat has not moved a foot from </p><p>where I dove. Come, bear a hand and </p><p>lift my burden; it is heavy, and I am near </p><p>spent. There are handles by whidi to </p><p>grasp it.” </p><p> The burden proved to be a greenish</p><p>metal coffer—bronze, I judged—which I </p><p>estimated to measure some twenty inches </p><p>long by twelve wide and nine inches </p><p>deep. And how she rose to the surface </p><p>weighted with that, passes my under- </p><p>standing. But how she knew it was down </p><p>there passes my comprehension, too. But </p><p>650 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>then, Heldra Helstrom herself was an </p><p>enigma. </p><p> She re-wrapped herself in her flimsy</p><p>silken robe of crimson and smiled hap- </p><p>pily, when she should have been shiver- </p><p>ing almost to pieces. </p><p> "If you’ll ship the mast and spread the</p><p>sail again, Uncle John,” she said, surpriz- </p><p>ingly matter-of-fact now that her errand </p><p>was successfully accomplished, "we’ll go </p><p>home. I’d like a glass of brandy and a </p><p>smoke, myself; and I read in your mind </p><p>that such is your chief desire, at present.” </p><p>Back at the cottage again, and com- </p><p>fortable once more, Heldra requested </p><p>me to bear the coffer into her room, </p><p>which I did. For over an hour she re- </p><p>mained in there, then returned to the </p><p>living-room where I sat, and I stared at </p><p>the picture she presented. If she had </p><p>always been beautiful, now she was sur- </p><p>passingly glorious. </p><p> Instead of the usual crimson robe, her</p><p>lovely body was sheathed in a sleeveless, </p><p>sheer, tightly fitting silken slip, cut at the </p><p>throat in a long sloping V reaching nearly </p><p>to her waist. The garment was palest sea- </p><p>green, so flimsy in texture that it might </p><p>as well have been compounded of min- </p><p>gled moon-mist and cobwebs. Her rosy- </p><p>pearl flesh gleamed through the fabric </p><p>with an alluring shimmer which thrilled </p><p>anew my jaded old senses at the artistic </p><p>wonder of her. </p><p> A gold collar, gem-studded, unmistak-</p><p>ably of ancient Egyptian workmanship, </p><p>was resting on her superb shoulders—loot </p><p>of some viking foray into the far South- </p><p>lands, doubtless. A broad girdle of gold </p><p>plates, squared, and also gem-studded, </p><p>was about her sloping hips, and was </p><p>clasped in front by a broader plate with </p><p>a sun-emblem in jeweled sets; from </p><p>which plate or buckle it fell in tv/o broad </p><p>bands nearly to her white slender feet. </p><p> Broad torques of gold on upper arms</p><p>and about her wrists, and an intricately </p><p>wrought golden tiara with disks of en-</p><p>graved gold pendent by chains and hang- </p><p>ing over her ears, set off her loveliness as </p><p>never before. Even her red-gold hair, </p><p>braided in two thick ropes, falling over </p><p>her breasts to below her waist, were </p><p>clasped by gem-set brooches of gold. </p><p> "Ragnar Wave-Flame’s gift to me, O</p><p>Jarl Wulf,” she breathed softly. "Do you </p><p>like your niece thus arrayed?” </p><p> Norse princess out of an elder day, or</p><p>Norse witch from an even older and </p><p>wickeder period of the world—whichever </p><p>this Heldra Helstrom was, of one thing </p><p>I was certain, no lovelier woman ever </p><p>lived than this superb being who styled </p><p>herself my "niece.” </p><p> And so I told her, and was amply re-</p><p>warded by the radiance of her smile, and </p><p>the ecstatic kiss she implanted on my </p><p>cheek. </p><p> Despite her splendid array, she perched</p><p>on the arm of my chair, and began toying </p><p>w’ith my left hand. Presently she lifted </p><p>it to the level of my eyes, laughing soft- </p><p>ly. I’d felt nothing, yet she’d slipped a </p><p>broad tarnished silver ring of antique de- </p><p>sign on my third finger. </p><p> "It was yours in the ancient days, O</p><p>Jarl Wulf,” she whispered in her favorite </p><p>tongue—the archaic form of the Norsk </p><p>language. "Yours again is the ancient </p><p>ring, now! Ragnar herself carved the </p><p>mystic runes upon it. Shall I read them, </p><p>O	Jarl, or will you?”</p><p> "They are beyond my skill,” I con-</p><p>fessed. "The w'ords are in the ’secret’ </p><p>language that only the *RJme-Kanaars’ </p><p>understood. Nor was it well for others </p><p>than witches and warlocks to seek to un- </p><p>derstand them.” </p><p> "Ragnar took that ring from Jarl</p><p>Wulf’s finger ere she set fire to the </p><p>dragon-ship,” Heldra murmured. "Had </p><p>those runes been on the ring when your </p><p>foes set upon you—they, not you, would </p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>651 </p><p>have perished in the sword-play, Jarl </p><p>Red-Sword! </p><p> "But the sea-born witdi knew that you</p><p>would weary of Valhalla in a day to </p><p>come, and w'ould return to this world of </p><p>strife and slaying, of loss and grief, of </p><p>hate and the glutting of vengeance—and, </p><p>knowing, she carved the runes, that in </p><p>time the charmed ring would return to </p><p>its proper owner. </p><p> "It is her express command that I read</p><p>them to you, for knowing the runes, </p><p>never shall water drown or fire burn; nor </p><p>sword or spear or ax ever wound you, </p><p>so be it that in time of danger you speak </p><p>the weird words! </p><p> "And for my sake—you who are my</p><p>’Uncle John’ to all the rest of the world, </p><p>but to me are dearer than old Jarl Wulf </p><p>was to Ragnar the sea-witch—I implore </p><p>you to learn the runic charm, and use it </p><p>if ever danger menaces. Promise me! </p><p>Promise me, I say!” </p><p> Her silvery voice was vibrant with</p><p>fierce intensity. She caught my right hand </p><p>and pressed it against her palpitant body, </p><p>just beneath her proudly swelling left </p><p>breast. </p><p> "Promise!” she reiterated. "I beg your</p><p>promise! With your right hand on my </p><p>heart I adjure you to learn the rune.” </p><p>"No fool like an old fool,” I grum- </p><p>bled, adding a trifle maliciously, "particu- </p><p>larly when in the hands of a lovely wo- </p><p>man. But such a fuss you make over a few </p><p>words of outlandish gibberish! Read me </p><p>the rune, then, witch-maid! I’d learn </p><p>w'ords worse than those can be to please </p><p>you and set your mind at rest.” </p><p> With her scarlet lips close to my ear,</p><p>with bated breath, and in a tone so low I </p><p>could barely catch her carefully enunci- </p><p>ated syllables, she whispered the words. </p><p>And although her whisper was softer </p><p>than the sighing of gentlest summer </p><p>breeze, the tones rang on my inner hear- </p><p>ing like strokes of a great war-hammer </p><p>smiting on a shield of bronze. There</p><p>was no need to repeat them—either on </p><p>her part or mine. There was no likeli- </p><p>hood of my ever forgetting that runic </p><p>diarm. I could not, even if I would. </p><p> "Surely,” I muttered, "you are an</p><p>adept in the ancient magic. Well for me </p><p>that you love me, else your witcheries </p><p>might-” </p><p> Most amazingly she laughed, a clear,</p><p>ringing merriment with no trace of the </p><p>mystic about it. </p><p> "Let me show you something—a game,</p><p>a play; one that will amuse me and en- </p><p>tertain you.” </p><p> She fairly danced across the room and</p><p>into her own room, emerging with an an- </p><p>tique mirror of some burnished, silver- </p><p>like metal. This she held out to me. I </p><p>grasped it by its handle obediently </p><p>enough, humoring this new whim. </p><p> "Look into it and say if it is a good</p><p>mirror,” she bade, her sapphire eyes </p><p>a-dance with elfin mirth. </p><p> I looked. All I could see was my same</p><p>old face, tanned and wrinkled, which I </p><p>daily saw whenever I shaved or combed my </p><p>hair, and I told her so. She perched again </p><p>on the arm of my chair, laid her cheek </p><p>against mine, and curved her cool arm </p><p>about my neck. </p><p> "Now look again!”</p><p> Again the mirror told truth. I saw my</p><p>face the same as ever, and hers as well, </p><p>"Like a rose beside a granite boulder,” as </p><p>I assured her. </p><p> "You do but see yourself as you think</p><p>of yourself,” she murmured softly, "and </p><p>me you behold as you believe me to be.” </p><p>She brought her lips close to the mir- </p><p>ror and breathed upon its surface with </p><p>her warm breath. It clouded over, then </p><p>cleared. Her voice came, more murmur- </p><p>ous than before, but with a definite note </p><p>of sadness: </p><p> "Once more, look! Behold yourself as</p><p>652 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>I see you always; and behold me as I </p><p>know myself to be! And when I am gone </p><p>beyond your ken, remember the witch- </p><p>maid, Heldra, as one woman who loved </p><p>you so truly that she showed you herself </p><p>as she actually was!” </p><p> The man’s face was still my own, but</p><p>mine as it was in the days of early man- </p><p>hood, ere life’s thunders had graven their </p><p>scars on brow and cheeks and lips, and </p><p>before the snows of many winters had </p><p>whitened my hair. </p><p> Her features were no less beautiful,</p><p>but in her reflected eyes I saw ages and </p><p>ages of life, and bitter experience, and </p><p>terrible wisdom that was far more wicked </p><p>than holy; and it came to me with convic- </p><p>tion irrefutable that beside this young- </p><p>appearing girl, maid, or woman, all my </p><p>years were but as the span of a puling </p><p>babe compared to the ageless age of an </p><p>immortal. </p><p> "That, at least, is no glamyr,” her voice</p><p>sighed drearily, heavy with the burden of </p><p>her own knowledge of herself. </p><p> I laid my thick, heavy old arm across</p><p>her smooth satiny white shoulders, and I </p><p>turned her head until her sapphire eyes </p><p>met mine fairly. Very gently I kissed </p><p>her on her brow. </p><p> "Heldra Helstrom,” I said, and my</p><p>voice sounded husky with emotion, "you </p><p>may be all you have just shown me, or </p><p>worse! You may be Ragnar Wave-Flame </p><p>herself, the sea-witch who never dies. </p><p>You may be even what I sometimes sus- </p><p>pect, the empress of Hell, come amongst </p><p>mortals for no good purpose! But be you </p><p>what you may, old or young, maid or </p><p>woman, good or evil, witch, spirit, angel </p><p>or she-devil, such as you are, you are you </p><p>and I am I, and for some w'eird reason </p><p>we seem to love each other in our own </p><p>way; so let there be an end to what </p><p>you are or have been, or who I was in </p><p>other lives, and content ourselves with </p><p>what is!” </p><p> Were those bright glitters in her sap-</p><p>phire eyes tear-drops ready to fall? If so,</p><p>I was not sure, for with a cry like that </p><p>of a lost soul who has found sanctuary, </p><p>she buried her face on my shoulder. . . . </p><p> After a long silence, she slipped from</p><p>the arm of my chair, and wordlessly, her </p><p>face averted, she passed into her room. </p><p>After an hour or so, I went to my own </p><p>room—but I could not sleep. . . . </p><p>Time passed, and I dwelt in a "fool’s </p><p>paradise,” dreaming that it would </p><p>last for ever. </p><p> The summer colony began to arrive.</p><p>There were cottages all along the shore, </p><p>but there were likewise big estates, whose </p><p>owners were rated as "somebodies,” to </p><p>put it mildly. </p><p> A governor of a great and sovereign</p><p>state; an ex-president of our nation; sev- </p><p>eral foreign diplomats and some of their </p><p>legation attaches—but why enumerate, </p><p>when one man only concerns this narra- </p><p>tive? </p><p> Michael Commnenus, tall, slight, dap-</p><p>per, inclined to swarthiness, with black </p><p>eyes under crescent-curved black eye- </p><p>brows; with supercilious smiling lips, a </p><p>trifle too red for a man; with suave Old </p><p>World manners, and a most amazingly </p><p>conceited opinion of himself as a "Lady- </p><p>charmer.” </p><p> It was not his first summer in our</p><p>midst; and although when he was in </p><p>Washington at his legation I never gave </p><p>him a thought, when I saw his too hand- </p><p>some face on the beach, I felt a trifle sick! </p><p>I knew, positively, that the minute he set </p><p>eyes on Heldra. ... Of course I knew, </p><p>too, that my witch-niece could take care </p><p>of herself; but just the same, I sensed </p><p>annoyance, and perhaps, tragedy. </p><p> Well, I was in nowise mistaken.</p><p> Heldra and I were just about to shove</p><p>off in my dory for a sail. It was her chief </p><p>delight, and mine too, for that matter. </p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>653 </p><p> Casually, along strolled Michael Comm-</p><p>nenus, twirling a slender stick, caressing </p><p>a slender black thread he styled a mus- </p><p>tache, smiling his approbation of him- </p><p>self. I’d seen that variety of casual ap- </p><p>proach before. As our flippant young </p><p>moderns say: It was "old stuff.” </p><p> Out of the corner of my eye I watched.</p><p>The Don Juan smirk faded when his cal- </p><p>culating, appraising eyes met her sapphire </p><p>orbs, now shining like the never-melting </p><p>polar ice. An expression of bewilder- </p><p>ment spread over his features. His </p><p>swarthy skin went a sickly greenish- </p><p>bronze. Involuntarily he crossed himself </p><p>and passed on. The man was afraid, actu- </p><p>ally fear-struck! </p><p> "Ever see him before, Heldra?” I que-</p><p>ried. "He looked at you as if the devil </p><p>would be a pleasanter sight. That’s one </p><p>man who failed to fall for your vivid </p><p>beauty, you sea-witch!” </p><p> "Who is he?” she asked in a peculiar</p><p>tone. "I liked his looks even less than he </p><p>liked mine.” </p><p> "Michael Commnenus,” I informed</p><p>her, and was about to give her his pedi- </p><p>gree as we local people knew him, but </p><p>was interrupted by her violently explo- </p><p>sive: </p><p> "Who?”</p><p> "Michael Commnenus,” I stated again,</p><p>a trifle testily. "And you needn’t shout! </p><p>What’s he done-” but again she in- </p><p>terrupted, speaking her archaic Norsk: </p><p>"Ho! Varang Chiefs of the Guard </p><p>Imperial! Thorfinn! Arvid! Sven! And </p><p>ye who followed them—Gudrun! Rand- </p><p>var! Haakon! Smid! And all ye Varangs </p><p>in Valhalla, give ear! And ye, O fiends, </p><p>witches, warlocks, trolls, vampyrs, and all </p><p>the dark gods who dwell in Hel’s halls </p><p>wrhere the eternal frozen fires blaze with- </p><p>out heat, give ear to my voice, and cher- </p><p>ish my words, for I give ye all joyous </p><p>tidings. </p><p> "He lives! After all these long centu-</p><p>ries Michael Commnenus dwells again on </p><p>the bosom of fair Earth! In a body of </p><p>flesh and blood and bone, of nerve and </p><p>tissue and muscle he lives! He lives, I </p><p>say! And I have found him! </p><p> "Oh, now I know why the Norns who</p><p>rule all fate sent me to this place. And </p><p>I shall not fail ye, heroes! Content ye, </p><p>one and all, I shall not jail!” </p><p> Was this the gorgeous beauty I’d</p><p>learned to love for her gentleness? Hers </p><p>was the face of a furious female demon </p><p>for a moment; but then her normal ex- </p><p>pression returned and she sighed heavily. </p><p> "Heed me not, Uncle John,” she said</p><p>drearily. "I did but recall an ancient tale </p><p>of foul treachery perpetrated on sundry </p><p>Norsemen in the Varangian Guard of a </p><p>Byzantine emperor ages agone. </p><p> "The niddering—worse than 'coward'</p><p>—who wrought the bane of some thirty- </p><p>odd vikings, was a Commnenus, nephew </p><p>to the Emperor Alexander Commne- </p><p>nus. ... I live too much in memories </p><p>of the past, I fear, and for the moment </p><p>somewhat forgot myself in the hate all </p><p>good Norse maids should hold toward </p><p>any who bear the accursed name of the </p><p>Commneni. </p><p> "Still, even as I know you to be old</p><p>Jarl Wulf Red-Brand returned to this </p><p>world through the gateway of birth—it </p><p>would be nothing surprizing if this </p><p>spawn of the Commneni were in truth </p><p>that same Michael Commnenus of whom </p><p>the tale is told.” </p><p> "The belief in reincarnation is age-</p><p>old,” I said reflectively. "And in several </p><p>parts of the world it is a fundamental </p><p>tenet of religion. If there be truth in the </p><p>idea, there is, as you say, nothing sur- </p><p>prizing if anybody now living should </p><p>have been anybody else in some former </p><p>life. . . . And that sample of the Comm- </p><p>ncni appears quite capable of any treach- </p><p>ery that might serve a purpose at the mo- </p><p>ment! But, Heldra,” I implored her* </p><p>654 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>struck by a sudden intuition, "I beg of </p><p>you not to indulge in any of your devil- </p><p>ries, witcheries, or Norse magic. If this </p><p>Michael is that other Michael, yet that </p><p>was long ago; and if he has not already </p><p>atoned for his sin, you may be very sure </p><p>that somewhere, sometime, somehow he </p><p>will atone; so do not worry your regal </p><p>head about him.” </p><p> "Spoken like a right Saga-man,” she</p><p>smiled as I finished my brief homily. "I </p><p>thank you for your words of wisdom. </p><p>And now, Jarl Wulf Red-Brand, I know </p><p>you to be fey as well as I am. 'Surely </p><p>he will atone for his sin’ ... oh! a most </p><p>comforting thought! So let us think no </p><p>more about the matter.” </p><p> I glanced sharply at her. Her too in-</p><p>stant acquiescence was suspicious. But </p><p>her sapphire eyes met mine fairly, smil- </p><p>ingly, sending as always a warm glow of </p><p>contentment through me. So I accepted </p><p>her assurance as it sounded, and gave </p><p>myself up to the enjoyment of the sail </p><p>and the sound of her silvery voice as she </p><p>sang an old English love ballad I’d </p><p>known as a young man. And under the </p><p>spell of her magnetic personality gradu- </p><p>ally the episode of Michael Commnenus </p><p>faded into nothingness—for a while. </p><p>A COUPLE of days later, just about </p><p>dark, Heldra came down the stairs </p><p>from the attic, where she’d been rum- </p><p>maging. In her hand she carried an old </p><p>violin-case. I looked and grinned rue- </p><p>fully. </p><p> "You are a bad old Uncle John,” she</p><p>scolded. "Why did you not tell me you </p><p>played the 'fidel/ even as Jarl Wulf </p><p>played one in his time? Think of all the </p><p>sweet music you might have made in the </p><p>past winter nights, and think of the </p><p>dances I might have danced for your de- </p><p>light while you played—even as Ragnar </p><p>danced for her old Jarl.” </p><p> "But I did not tell you that I played a</p><p>fiddle—because I don’t,” I stated flatly. </p><p>"That is a memento of an absurd ambi- </p><p>tion I once cherished, but which died</p><p>a-borning. I tried to learn the thing, but </p><p>the noises I extracted were so abominable </p><p>that I quit before I’d fairly got started.” </p><p>"You are teasing,” she retorted, her </p><p>eyes sparkling with mischief. "But I am </p><p>not to be put off thus easily. Tonight </p><p>you will play, and I will dance—such a </p><p>dance as you have never beheld even </p><p>when you were Jarl Wulf.” </p><p> "If I try to play that thing,” I assured</p><p>her seriously, "you’ll have a time dancing </p><p>to my discords, you gorgeous tease!” </p><p>"We’ll see,” she nodded. "But even </p><p>as my magic revealed to me the where- </p><p>abouts of the 'fidel/ so my spirit tells me </p><p>that you play splendidly.” </p><p> "Your magic’ may be all right, but</p><p>your ’spirit’ has certainly misinformed </p><p>you,” I growled. </p><p> "My spirit has never yet lied to me—</p><p>nor has it done so this time.” Her tone </p><p>was grave, yet therein was a lurking </p><p>mockery; and I became a trifle provoked. </p><p> "All right,” I assented grouchily.</p><p>"Whenever you feel like hearing me </p><p>fplay/ I’ll do it. And you’ll never want </p><p>to listen to such noises again.” </p><p> She went into her room laughing</p><p>sweetly, and took the fiddle with her. </p><p> After supper she said nothing about</p><p>me playing that old fiddle, and I fatu- </p><p>ously thought she’d let the matter drop. </p><p>But about ten o’clock she w^ent to her </p><p>room without a word. She emerged after </p><p>a bit, wearing naught but a sheer loose </p><p>palest blue silk robe, held at the waist </p><p>only by a tiny jeweled gold filigree clasp. </p><p>Loose as the robe was, it clung lovingly </p><p>to her every curve as if caressing the </p><p>beauteous, statuesque body it could not </p><p>and would not conceal. </p><p> She was totally devoid of all ornament</p><p>save that tiny brooch, and her wondrous </p><p>fiery-gold hair was wholly unconfined, </p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>655 </p><p>falling below her waist in a cascade of </p><p>shimmering sunset hues, against which </p><p>her rose-pearl body gleamed through the </p><p>filmy gossamer-like robe. </p><p> Again she sat and talked for a while.</p><p>But along toward midnight she broke a </p><p>short silence with: </p><p> "I’ll be back in a minute. I wish to</p><p>prepare for my dancing.” </p><p> From her room she brought four an-</p><p>tique bronze lamps and a strangely </p><p>shaped urn of oil. She filled the lamps </p><p>and placed one at each corner of the liv- </p><p>ing-room, on the floor. </p><p> Back into her room she went, and out</p><p>again with an octagonal-shaped stone, </p><p>flat on both sides, about an inch thick, </p><p>and some four inches across. This she </p><p>placed on the low taboret whereon I usu- </p><p>ally kept my nargilyeh. She propped up </p><p>that slab of stone as if placing a mirror— </p><p>which I decided it couldn’t very well be, </p><p>as it did not even reflect light but seemed </p><p>as dull as a slab of slate. </p><p> As a final touch, she brought out that</p><p>confounded old fiddle! And on her scar- </p><p>let lips was a smile that a seraph might </p><p>have envied, so innocent and devoid of </p><p>guile it seemed. </p><p> "What’s this?” I demanded—as if I</p><p>didn't know! </p><p> "Your little 'jidel’ with which you will</p><p>make for your Heldra such rapturous </p><p>music,” she smiled caressingly. </p><p> "Um-m-m-m!” I grunted. "And what</p><p>arc those lamps for—and that ugly slab </p><p>of black rock?” </p><p> "That black slab is a 'Hel-stone,’ hav-</p><p>ing the property of reflecting whatever is </p><p>directly before it, if illumined by those </p><p>four lamps placed at certain angles; and </p><p>later it will give olr those same reflections </p><p>—even as the stuff called luminous cal- </p><p>cium sulfide absorbs light-rays until sur- </p><p>charged, and then emits them, when </p><p>properly exposed. So, you see, we can </p><p>preserve the picture of my dance.” </p><p> "Heldra,” I demanded sharply, "are</p><p>you up to some devilishness? All this </p><p>looks amazingly like the stage-setting for </p><p>witch-working!” </p><p> "I have sung for you, on different</p><p>nights,” she replied in gentlest reproach, </p><p>"and have told old tales, and have attired </p><p>myself again and again for your pleasure </p><p>in beholding me. Have all these things </p><p>ever bewitched you, or harmed anyone? </p><p>How, then, can the fact of my dancing </p><p>for my own satisfaction, before the mys- </p><p>tic Hel-stone, do any harm?” </p><p>As ever, she won. Her sapphire orbs </p><p>k. did queer things to me whenever </p><p>they looked into my own gray, faded old </p><p>eyes—trusting me to understand and ap- </p><p>prove whatever she did, simply because </p><p>she was she and I was I. </p><p> "All right,” I said. "But you’re mak-</p><p>ing a fool of me—insisting that I play </p><p>this old fiddle. Well—I’ll teach you a </p><p>lesson!” And I drew the bow over the </p><p>strings with a most appalling wail. </p><p> And with the unexpected swiftness of</p><p>a steel trap closing on its victim, icy fin- </p><p>gers locked about my wrist, and I knew </p><p>very definitely that another and alien per- </p><p>sonality was guiding my arm and fingers! </p><p>But there came likewise a swift certitude </p><p>that if I behaved, no harm would ensue </p><p>—to me, at least. So I let the thing have </p><p>its way—and listened to such music as I </p><p>had not believed could be played on any </p><p>instrument devised by a mortal. </p><p> I wish that I could describe that music,</p><p>but I do not know the right words. </p><p>I doubt if they have been invented. It </p><p>was wild, barbaric, savage, but likewise it </p><p>was alluring, seductive, stealing aw'ay all </p><p>inhibitions—too much of it would have </p><p>corrupted the angels in heaven. I was </p><p>almost in a stupor, intoxicated, like a </p><p>hasheesh-catc-r in a drugged dream, spell- </p><p>656 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>bound, unable to break from the thrall- </p><p>dom holding my will, drowning in rap- </p><p>ture well-nigh unbearable. </p><p> Heldra suddenly blew out the big kero-</p><p>sene lamp standing on the table, leaving </p><p>as sole illumination the rays from those </p><p>four bronze lights standing in the cor- </p><p>ners. </p><p> Her superb body moved gracefully,</p><p>slowly at first, then faster, into the intri- </p><p>cate figure and pattern of a dance that </p><p>was old when the wrorld was young. . . . </p><p> With inward horror I knew the why</p><p>and wherefore of that entire ceremonial; </p><p>knew I’d been be-cozened and be-japed; </p><p>yet knew, likewise, that it was too late for </p><p>interference. I could not even speak. I </p><p>could but watch, while some personality </p><p>alien to my body played maddeningly on </p><p>my fiddle, and the 'niece’ I loved danced </p><p>a dance deliberately planned to seduce a </p><p>man who hated and feared the dancer— </p><p>and for what devilish purpose I could </p><p>well guess! </p><p> I saw the light-rays converge on her</p><p>alluring, statuesque body, saw them ap- </p><p>parently pass through her and impinge </p><p>on the surface of that black, sullen, oc- </p><p>tagonal Hel-stone, and be greedily swal- </p><p>lowed up, until the dull, black surface </p><p>glowed like a rare black Australian opal; </p><p>and ever the dancing of the witch-girl </p><p>grew more alluring, more seductive, more </p><p>abandoned. And I knew why Heldra was </p><p>thus shamefully—shamelessly, rather— </p><p>conducting! She had read Michael Comm- </p><p>nenus his character very accurately; knew </p><p>that his soul had recognized her hatred </p><p>for him, and feared her—and that her </p><p>one chance to get him in her clutches lay </p><p>in inflaming his senses . . . and she’d even </p><p>told me the properties of that most damn- </p><p>able Hel-stone! </p><p> Wilder and faster came the music, and</p><p>sv/ifter and still more alluring grew the </p><p>rhythmic response as Heldra’s lovely body </p><p>swayed and spun and swooped and pos- </p><p>tured; until ultimately her waving arms </p><p>brought her fluttering hands, in the brief-</p><p>est of touches, into contact with the tiny </p><p>brooch at her waist and the filmy robe </p><p>was swept away in a single gesture that </p><p>was faithfully recorded on the sullen sur- </p><p>face of the Hel-stone. </p><p> Instantly the dancer stopped as if petri-</p><p>fied, her arms outstretched as in invita- </p><p>tion, her regal head thrown back, show- </p><p>ing the long smooth white column of her </p><p>throat, her clear, half-closed, sapphire- </p><p>blue eyes agleam with subtle chal- </p><p>lenge. . . . </p><p> The uncanny music died in a sin-</p><p>gle sighing, sobbing whisper, poison- </p><p>sweet . . . the clutching, icy fingers were </p><p>gone from my wrist... my first coherent </p><p>thought was: Had that spell been di- </p><p>rected at me, the old adage anent "old </p><p>fools” would have been swiftly justified! </p><p> And I knew that to all intents and</p><p>purposes, Michael Commnenus was sunk! </p><p> Just the same, I was furious. Heldra</p><p>had gone too far, and I told her so, flatly. </p><p>I pointed out in terms unmistakable that </p><p>what she planned was murder, or worse; </p><p>and that this was modern America where- </p><p>in witchcraft had neither place nor sanc- </p><p>tion, and that I’d be no accessory to any </p><p>such devilishness as she was contriving. </p><p>Oh, I made myself and my meaning </p><p>plain. </p><p> And she stood and looked at me with</p><p>a most injured expression. She made me </p><p>feel as if I’d wantonly struck a child </p><p>across the face in the midst of its innocent </p><p>diversions! </p><p> "I don’t actually care if the devil flies</p><p>off with Michael Commnenus,” I con- </p><p>cluded wrathfully, "but I won’t have him </p><p>murdered by you while you’re living </p><p>here, posing as my niece! No doubt it’s </p><p>quite possible for you to evade any legal </p><p>consequences by disappearing, but what </p><p>of me? As accessory, I’d be liable to life </p><p>imprisonment, at the least!” </p><p> W. T.—1</p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>657 </p><p> Her face lightened as by magic, and</p><p>her voice was genuinely regretful, and in </p><p>her eyes was a light of sincere love. She </p><p>came to me and wrapped her white arms </p><p>about my neck, murmuring terms of af- </p><p>fectionate consolation. </p><p> "Poor dear Uncle John! Heldra w'as</p><p>thoughtless—wicked me! And I might </p><p>have involved you in serious trouble? I </p><p>am ashamed! But the fate laid upon me </p><p>by the Norns is heavy, and I may not </p><p>evade it, even for you, whom I love. </p><p>Tell me,” she demanded suddenly, "if I </p><p>should destroy the vile earthworm with- </p><p>out any suspicion attaching to you, or to </p><p>me, would you love me as before, even </p><p>knowing what I had done?” </p><p> "No!” I fairly snarled the denial. I</p><p>wanted it to be emphatic. </p><p> She smiled serenely, and kissed me</p><p>full on my lips. </p><p> "I never thought to thank a mortal for</p><p>lying to me, but now I do! Deep in your </p><p>heart I can read your true feeling, and I </p><p>am glad! But now”—and her tone took </p><p>on a sadness most desolate—"I regret to </p><p>say that on the morrow I leave you. The </p><p>lovely garments you gave me, and the </p><p>trunks containing them, I take with me, </p><p>as you would not wish that I go empty- </p><p>handed. Nor will I insult you, O Jarl </p><p>Wulf, by talk of payment. </p><p> "When I am gone, you will just</p><p>casually mention that I have returned to </p><p>my home, and the local gossips will not </p><p>suspect aught untoward. And soon I shall </p><p>be forgotten, and no one will suspect, or </p><p>possibly connect you, or me, with what </p><p>inevitably must happen to that spawn </p><p>of the Commneni. </p><p> "But of this be very sure: Somewhere,</p><p>sometime, you and I shall be together </p><p>again. . . Her voice broke, she kissed </p><p>me fiercely on the lips, then tenderly on </p><p>both cheeks, then lastly, with a queer rev- </p><p>erence, on my furrowed old brow. Then </p><p>She turned, went straight to her room, </p><p>W. T.—2 </p><p>shut the door, and I heard the click of </p><p>the key as she locked herself in, for the </p><p>first time during her stay in my house. . . . </p><p> Next morning, as she’d planned, she</p><p>departed on the first train cityward. I’d </p><p>given her money enough for all her re- </p><p>quirements—more, indeed, than she was </p><p>willing to take at first, declaring that she </p><p>intended selling so*me few of her jewels. </p><p> And with her departure went all which</p><p>made life worth living. . . . </p><p>Heavily I dragged my reluctant feet </p><p>back to the empty shell of a cottage </p><p>which until then had been an earthly </p><p>paradise to an old man—and the very </p><p>first thing I laid eyes on was that ac- </p><p>cursed Hel-stone, lying on the living- </p><p>room table. </p><p> I picked it up, half minded to shatter</p><p>it to fragments, but an idea seized me. </p><p>I bore it down-cellar, where semi-dark- </p><p>ness prevailed, and the Hel-stone glowed </p><p>softly with its witch-light, showing me </p><p>the loveliness of her who had departed </p><p>from me. And I pressed the cold octagon </p><p>to my lips, thankful that she’d left me </p><p>the tiling as a feeble substitute for her </p><p>presence. Then I turned and went back </p><p>upstairs, found an old ivory box of </p><p>Chinese workmanship, and placed the </p><p>Hel-stone therein, very carefully, as a </p><p>thing priceless. </p><p> I went to bed early that night. There</p><p>was no reason to sit up. But I could not </p><p>sleep. I lay there in my bed, cursing the </p><p>entire line of Commneni, root, trunk and </p><p>branch, from the first of that ilk whom </p><p>history records to this latest scion, or </p><p>"spawn,” as Heldra had termed him. </p><p> Around midnight, being still wakeful,</p><p>I arose, got the Hel-stone and sat in the </p><p>darkness—and gradually became aware </p><p>that I was not alone! Looking up, I saw </p><p>her I’d lost standing in a witch-glow of </p><p>phosphorescent light. I knew at once </p><p>that it was not Heldra in person, but </p><p>658 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>her "scin-lacca” or "shining double/' a </p><p>"sending," and that it was another of her </p><p>witcheries. </p><p> "But even this is welcome,” I thought.</p><p>Then I felt her thought expressed </p><p>through that phantasmal semblance of </p><p>her own gorgeous self—and promptly </p><p>strove, angrily, to resist her command. </p><p>Much good it did me! </p><p> Utterly helpless, yet fully cognizant of</p><p>my actions, but oddly assured that about </p><p>me was a cloak of invisibility—the </p><p>uglamyr” of the ancient Alrunas — I </p><p>dresssed, took the Hel-stone, and passed </p><p>out into the night. </p><p> Straight to the cottage of Commnenus</p><p>I went, pawed about under the door-step, </p><p>and planted there the Hel-stone; then, </p><p>still secure in the mystic glamor, I re- </p><p>turned to my own abode. </p><p> And no sooner had I seated myself in</p><p>my chair for a smoke, than I realized </p><p>fully the utter devilishness of that witch </p><p>from out the wintry seas whom I had </p><p>taken into my home and had sponsored </p><p>as my "niece” in the eyes of the w'orld. </p><p> Right then I decided to go back and</p><p>get that Hel-stone, and smash it—and </p><p>couldn’t do it! I got sleepy so suddenly </p><p>that I awoke to find that it was broad </p><p>daylight, and nine-thirty a. m. And from </p><p>then on, as regularly as twilight came, I </p><p>could only stay awake so long as I kept </p><p>my thoughts away from that accursed </p><p>Hel-stone; wherefore I determined that </p><p>the thing could stay where it was until </p><p>it rotted, for all me! </p><p> Then Commnenus came along the</p><p>beach late one afternoon. He raised his </p><p>hat in his Old World, courtly fashion, </p><p>and tried to make some small talk. I </p><p>grunted churlishly and ignored him. But </p><p>finally he came out bluntly with: </p><p> "Professor Craig, I know your opinion</p><p>of me, and admit it is to some extent </p><p>justifiable. I seem to have acquired the </p><p>reputation of being a Don Juan. But I </p><p>ask you to believe that I bitterly regret </p><p>that—now! Yet, despite that reputation, </p><p>I’d like to ask you a most natural ques- </p><p>tion, if I may.” </p><p> I nodded assent, unprepared for what</p><p>was coming, yet somehow assured it </p><p>would concern Heldra. Nor was I at all </p><p>disappointed, for he fairly blurted out: </p><p>"When do you expect Miss Helstrom </p><p>to return, if at all?” </p><p> I was flabbergasted! That is the only</p><p>word adequate. I glared at him in a </p><p>black fury. When I could catch my breath </p><p>I demanded: </p><p> "How did even you summon up the</p><p>infernal gall to ask me that?” </p><p> His reply finished flattening me out.</p><p>"Because I love her! Wait”—he </p><p>begged—"and hear me out, please! Even </p><p>a criminal is allowed that courtesy.” Then </p><p>as I nodded grudgingly, he resumed: </p><p>"The first time I saw her, something </p><p>deep within me shrank away from her </p><p>with repulsion. Still, I admired her </p><p>matchless beauty. But of late, since her </p><p>departure, there is not a night I do not </p><p>see her in my mind’s eye, and I know </p><p>that I love her, and hope that she will </p><p>return; hence my query. </p><p> "I will be frank—I even hope that she</p><p>noticed me and read my admiration with- </p><p>out dislike. Perhaps two minds can reach </p><p>each other—sometimes. For invariably I </p><p>see her with head thrown back, her eyes </p><p>half closed, and her arms held out as if </p><p>calling me to come to her. And if I knew </p><p>her whereabouts I’d most certainly go, </p><p>nor would I be ‘trifling,’ where she is </p><p>concerned. I want to win her, if possible, </p><p>as my wife; and an emperor should be </p><p>proud to call her that-” </p><p> "Very romantic,” I sneered. "But, Mr.</p><p>Woman-Chaser, I cut my eye-teeth a long </p><p>while before you were born, and I’m not </p><p>so easily taken in. The whereabouts of </p><p>my niece are no concern of yours. So </p><p>get away from me before I lose my </p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>659 </p><p>temper, or I’ll not be answerable for my </p><p>actions. Get!” </p><p> He went! The expression of my face</p><p>and the rage in my eyes must have </p><p>warned him that I was in a killing </p><p>humor. Well, I was. But likewise, I was </p><p>sick with fear. What he’d just told me </p><p>was sufficient to sicken me—the Hel- </p><p>stone had gotten in its damnable work. </p><p>My very soul was aghast as it envisioned </p><p>the inevitable consequences. . . . </p><p>An idea obsessed me, and I needed the </p><p>^ shades of night to cloak my </p><p>purpose. </p><p> Aimlessly I wandered from room to</p><p>room in my cottage, and finally drifted </p><p>into the room which had been Heldra’s. </p><p>Still aimlessly I pulled open drawer after </p><p>drawer in the dresser, and in the lowest </p><p>one I heard a faint metallic clink. </p><p> The four antique bronze lamps were</p><p>there. I shrewdly suspected she had left </p><p>them there as means of establishing con- </p><p>tact with her, should need arise. I ex- </p><p>amined them, and found, as I’d hoped, </p><p>that they were filled. </p><p> Around ten o’clock I placed those</p><p>lamps in the four corners of the living- </p><p>room, and lighted them, precisely as I’d </p><p>seen Heldra do. Then I tried my talents </p><p>at making an invocation. </p><p> "Heldra.' Heldra! Heldra!” I called.</p><p>"I, John Craig, who gave you shelter at </p><p>your need, call to you now, wheresoever </p><p>you be, to come to me at my need!” </p><p> The four lights went out, yet not a</p><p>breath of air stirred in the room. A faint- </p><p>ly luminous glow, the witch-light, en- </p><p>sued; and there she stood, or rather, the </p><p>jcin-lcecca, her shining double! But I </p><p>knew that anything I might say to it </p><p>would be the same as if she were there </p><p>in the flesh. </p><p> "Heldra,” I beseeched that witch-</p><p>lighted simulacrum, "by the love you </p><p>gave me, as Ragnar loved Jarl Wulf Red- </p><p>Sword, I ask that you again enshroud me </p><p>with the mantle of invisibility, the </p><p>fglamyr,’ and allow me to lift that ac- </p><p>cursed Hel-stone from where you com- </p><p>pelled me to conceal it. Let me return </p><p>it to you, at any place you may appoint, </p><p>so that it can do no more harm. </p><p> "Already that poor bewitched fool is</p><p>madly in love with you, because the radi- </p><p>ations of that enchanted stone have sat- </p><p>urated him every time he put foot on the </p><p>door-step beneath which I buried it! </p><p> "Heldra, grant me this one kindness,</p><p>and I will condone all sins you ever did </p><p>in all your witch-life.” </p><p> The shining wraith nodded slowly, un-</p><p>mistakably assenting to my request. As </p><p>from a far distance I heard a faint </p><p>whisper: </p><p> "Since it is your desire, get the Hel-</p><p>stone, and bear it yourself to the sea- </p><p>cave at the foot of the great cliff guard- </p><p>ing the north passage into the harbor. </p><p>Once you have borne it there, its work, </p><p>and yours, are done. </p><p> "And I thank you for saying that you</p><p>will condone all I have ever done, for </p><p>the burden of the past is heavy, and your </p><p>words have made it easier to bear.” </p><p> The shining wraith vanished, and I</p><p>went forth into the darkness. Straight to </p><p>the house where I’d hidden the Hel-stone </p><p>I betook myself, felt under the step, </p><p>found what I sought, took it with an in- </p><p>ward prayer of gratitude that because of </p><p>Heldra’s "glamyr” I had not been caught </p><p>at something questionable in appearance, </p><p>and started up the beach. </p><p> The tide was nearly out; so I walked</p><p>rapidly, as I had some distance to go, and </p><p>the sea-cave Heldra had designated could </p><p>not be entered at high tide, although once </p><p>within, one was safe enough and could </p><p>leave when the entrance was once more </p><p>exposed. </p><p> I entered the cave believing that I’d</p><p>promptly be rid of the entire mess, once </p><p>660 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>and for all. But there was no one there, </p><p>and the interior of the cave was as dark </p><p>as Erebus. I lit a match, and saw nothing. </p><p>The match burned out. I fumbled for </p><p>another—a dazzling ray from a flashlight </p><p>blinded me for a moment, then left my </p><p>face and swept the cave. A hated voice, </p><p>suave yet menacing, said: </p><p> "Well, Professor Craig, you may now</p><p>hand me whatever it was that you pur- </p><p>loined from under my door-step!” </p><p> An extremely business-like automatic</p><p>pistol was aimed in the exact direction of </p><p>my solar plexus—and the speaker was </p><p>none other than Michael Commnenus! </p><p> Very evidently the mystic "glamyr”</p><p>had failed to work that time. And I was </p><p>in a rather nasty predicament. </p><p> Then, abruptly, Heldra came! She</p><p>looked like an avenging fury, emerging </p><p>out of nowhere, apparently, and the </p><p>tables were turned. She wore a dark </p><p>cloak or long mantle draped over her </p><p>head and falling to her feet. </p><p> Her right hand was outstretched, and</p><p>with her left hand she seized the Hel- </p><p>stone from my grasp. She pointed one </p><p>finger at Commnenus, and did not even </p><p>touch him; yet had she smote with an </p><p>ancient war-hammer the effect would </p><p>have been the same. </p><p> "You dog, and son of a long line of</p><p>dogs!" her icy voice rang with excoriat- </p><p>ing virulence. "Drop that silly pistol! </p><p>Drop it, I say!” </p><p> A faint blue flicker snapped from her</p><p>extended finger—the pistol fell from a </p><p>flaccid hand. Commnenus seemed totally </p><p>paralyzed. Heldra's magic held him </p><p>completely in thralldom. ... I snapped </p><p>into activity and scooped up the gun. </p><p>"Followed me, did you?” I snarled. </p><p>•TIL-” </p><p> "Wait, Jarl Wulf!” Heldra’s tone was</p><p>frankly amused. "No need for you to do </p><p>aught! Mine is the blood-feud, mine the</p><p>blood-right! And ere I finish with yon </p><p>Michael Commnenus, an ancient hate </p><p>will be surfeited, and an ancient ven- </p><p>geance, too long delayed, will be consum- </p><p>mated.” </p><p> "Heldra,” I began, for dread seized</p><p>me at the ominous quality of her words, </p><p>"I will not stand for this affair going </p><p>any farther! I-” </p><p> "Be silent! Seat yourself over there</p><p>against the wall and watch and hear, but </p><p>move not nor speak again, lest I silence </p><p>you for ever!” </p><p> A force irresistible hurled me across</p><p>the cave and set me down, hard, on a </p><p>flat rock. I realized fully that I was obey- </p><p>ing her mandate—I couldn’t speak, </p><p>couldn’t even move my eyelids, so thor- </p><p>oughly had she inhibited any further in- </p><p>terference on my part. </p><p>Paying no further attention to Com- </p><p>mnenus for the moment, she crossed </p><p>over to me, bent and kissed me on my </p><p>lips, her sapphire eyes laughing into my </p><p>own blazing, wrathful eyes. </p><p> "Poor dear! It is too bad, but you</p><p>made me do it. I wanted you to help </p><p>me all the way through this tangled coil </p><p>—but you have been so difficult to man- </p><p>age! Yet in some ways you have played </p><p>into my hands splendidly. Yes, even to </p><p>bringing the Hel-stone back to me—and </p><p>I would not care to lose that for a king’s </p><p>ransom. And I put it into yon fool’s </p><p>head to be wakeful tonight, and see you </p><p>regain the Hel-stone, and follow you— </p><p>and thus walk into my nice little trap. </p><p>"And now!” </p><p> She whirled and faced Commnenus.</p><p>And for all that he was spellbound, in </p><p>his eyes I read fear and a ghastly fore- </p><p>knowledge of some dreadful fate about </p><p>to be meted out to him at her hands. </p><p> She picked up the flashlight he had</p><p>dropped and extinguished it with the </p><p>dry comment: </p><p> "We need a different light here—the</p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>661 </p><p>Hel-light from Hela’s halls!” And at </p><p>her word, a most peculiar light pervaded </p><p>the cave, and there was that about its </p><p>luminance that actually affrighted. Again </p><p>she spoke: </p><p> "Michael Commnenus, you utterly vile</p><p>worm of the earth! You know that your </p><p>doom is upon you—but as yet you know </p><p>not why. O beast lower than the swine! </p><p>Harken and remember my words even </p><p>after eternity is swallowed up in the Twi- </p><p>light of the Gods! You are a modern, </p><p>and know not that the self, the soul, is </p><p>eternal, undying, changing its body and </p><p>name in every clime and period, yet ever </p><p>the same soul, responsible for the deeds </p><p>of its bodies. You have even prated of </p><p>your soul—when in fact, you are the </p><p>property of the soul! </p><p> "Watch, now!” She pointed to the</p><p>cave entrance. "Behold there the wisps </p><p>of sea-fog gathering; and gradually will </p><p>come the rising tide. And on the cur- </p><p>tain of that cold, swirling mist, behold </p><p>the pictures of the past—a past centuries </p><p>old; a past wherein your craven, treacher- </p><p>ous soul sinned beyond all pardon! </p><p> "Look you, too, Jarl Wulf Red-Brand,</p><p>so that in all the days remaining to you </p><p>upon Earth, you may know that his doom </p><p>was just, and that Heldra is but execut- </p><p>ing a merited penalty! </p><p> "And while the shuttles of the Norm</p><p>weave the tapestry of the sin of this Com- </p><p>mnenus, I will tell all the tale of his </p><p>crimes. </p><p> "In Byzantium reigned the emperor,</p><p>Alexander Commnenus. Secure his </p><p>throne, guarded by the ponderous axes </p><p>and the long swords of the Varangians, </p><p>the splendid sons of the Norse-lands, </p><p>who had gone a-viking. Trusted and </p><p>loved were the Varangs by the emperor, </p><p>and oft he boasted of their fidelity, </p><p>swearing on the cross of Constantine that </p><p>to the last man would his Varangs perish </p><p>ere one would flinch a step from over- </p><p>whelming foes, citing itl proof their </p><p>battle-cry:</p><p> ff 'Valhalla! Valhalla! Victory or Val-</p><p>halla!’ </p><p> "Into the harbor of the Golden Horn</p><p>sailed the viking long-ship, the Grettir. </p><p>Three noble brothers owned her—Thor- </p><p>finn, Arvid, Sven. With them sailed </p><p>their sister . . . her fame as an Alruna- </p><p>maid, prophetess and priestess, was sung </p><p>throughout the Norse-lands. No man so </p><p>low but bore her reverence. Sin it was to </p><p>cast eyes of desire on any Alruna, and the </p><p>sister of the three brothers was held </p><p>especially holy. </p><p> "Between the hands of the Emperor</p><p>Alexander Commnenus, the three breth- </p><p>ren placed their hands,- swearing fealty </p><p>for a year and a day. Thirty fighting-men, </p><p>their crew, followed wherever the three </p><p>brothers led. And the great emperor, </p><p>hearing of their war-fame from others of </p><p>the Varangian guard, gave the brothers </p><p>high place in his esteem, and held them </p><p>nigh his own person. </p><p> "Their sister, the Alruna-maid, was</p><p>treated as became her rank and holy </p><p>repute. Aye! Even in Christian Byzan- </p><p>tium respect and honor were shown her </p><p>by the priests of an alien belief. But one </p><p>man in Byzantium aspired more greatly </p><p>than any other, Norseman or Byzantine, </p><p>had ever dared. </p><p> "A Commnenus he, grand admiral of</p><p>Byzantium’s war fleet, nephew to the em- </p><p>peror, enjoying to the full the confidence </p><p>and love of his imperial uncle. Notorious </p><p>for his profligacy, he cast his libertine </p><p>eyes on the Norse Alruna-maid, but with </p><p>no thought of making her his wife. Nay! </p><p>’Twas only as his leman he desired her. </p><p>„ , . So, he plotted. . . . </p><p> "The three brothers, Thorfinn, Arvid,</p><p>Sven, with their full crew, in the long- </p><p>ship Grettir were ordered to sea to cruise </p><p>against certain pirates harrying a portion </p><p>of the emperor’s coasts, </p><p>662 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> "Every man of the Grettir’s crew died</p><p>the deaths of rats—poison in the water- </p><p>casks! . . . They died as no Norseman </p><p>should die, brutes’ deaths, unfit for Val- </p><p>halla and the company of heroes who had </p><p>passed in battle! And their splendid </p><p>bodies, warped and distorted by pangs </p><p>of the poison, were cast overside as prey </p><p>for sharks, by two creatures of this grand </p><p>admiral, whom he had sent with the </p><p>three brothers as pilots knowing the </p><p>coast. They placed the drug in the casks, </p><p>they flung over the dead and dying, they </p><p>ran the Grettir aground and set fire to </p><p>her—but his was the command—-and his </p><p>the crime!” </p><p> And as Heldra told the tale, in a voice</p><p>whose dreary tones made the recital seem </p><p>even worse—the watching Commnenus </p><p>and I saw clearly depicted on the curtain </p><p>of the mist, each separate incident. . . . </p><p>Heldra turned to the wildly glaring </p><p>Michael. </p><p> "There was but one person in all</p><p>Byzantium who knew the truth,” she </p><p>screamed in sudden frenzy. "I give back </p><p>for a moment your power of speech. Say, </p><p>O	fool! Coward! Niddering! Who am I?”</p><p>Abruptly she tore off the somber cloak </p><p>and stood in all her loveliness, enhanced </p><p>by every ornament she once had worn for </p><p>my pleasure in beholding her thus ar- </p><p>rayed. </p><p>A cry of unearthly terror broke from </p><p>the staring Commnenus. His voice </p><p>was a strangled croak as he gasped: </p><p> "The Alruna-maid, Heldra! The red-</p><p>haired sea-witch—sister to the three </p><p>brothers, Thorfinn, Arvid, Sven!” </p><p> "Aye, you foul dog! And me you took</p><p>at night, after they sailed away, and me </p><p>you shut up where my cries for aid could </p><p>not be heard; and me you would have </p><p>despoiled—me, the Alruna-maid, sworn </p><p>to chastity! Me you jeered at and reviled, </p><p>boasting of your recent crimes against </p><p>all that the Norse-folk hold most sacred! </p><p> "Yet I escaped from that last dreadful</p><p>dungeon wherein you immured me— </p><p>how? </p><p> "By that magic known to such as I, I</p><p>called upon the empress of the Under- </p><p>world, Hela herself, and pledged her my </p><p>service in return for indefinitely contin- </p><p>ued life, until I could repay you and </p><p>avenge the heroes denied the joys of Val- </p><p>halla—by you! </p><p> "And now—comes swiftly the doom I</p><p>have planned for you . . . you who now </p><p>remember!” </p><p> Heldra spoke truly. Swiftly it came!</p><p>Sitting where I was, I saw it plainly, a </p><p>great dragon-ship with round shields dis- </p><p>played along her gunwales, with a big </p><p>square sail of crimson embroidered in </p><p>gold, with long oars dipping and lifting </p><p>in unison—in faint ghostly tones I could </p><p>hear the deep-sea rowers chanting, "Juchf </p><p>Hey! Sa-sa-sa! Hey-sa, Hey-sa, Hey-sa, </p><p>Hey-sa!” and knew it for the time-beat </p><p>rowing-song of the ancient vikings! </p><p> The whole picture was limned in the</p><p>cold sea-fires from whence that terrible </p><p>viking ghost-ship had risen with its crew </p><p>of long-dead Norsemen who were not </p><p>dead—the men too good for Hel, and </p><p>denied Valhalla. . . . </p><p> Straight to the mouth of the cave came</p><p>the ghost-ship, and its crew disembarked </p><p>and entered. Heldra cried out in joyous </p><p>welcome: </p><p> "Even from out of the deeps, ye</p><p>heroes, one and all, have ye heard my </p><p>silent summons, and obeyed the voice of </p><p>your Alruna from old time! Now your </p><p>waiting is at an end! </p><p> "Yonder stands the Commnenus. That</p><p>other concerns ye not—but mark him </p><p>well, for in a former life he was Jarl </p><p>Wulf Red-Brand! See, on his left hand </p><p>is still the old silver ring with its runes </p><p>of Ragnar Wave-Flame!” </p><p> The ghost-vikings turned their dead</p><p>THE SEA-WITCH </p><p>663 </p><p>eyes on me with a curious fixity. One and </p><p>all, they saluted. Evidently, Jarl Wulf </p><p>must have been somebody, in his time. </p><p>Then ignoring me, they turned to </p><p>Heldra, awaiting her further commands. </p><p>Commnenus they looked at, fiercely, </p><p>avidly. </p><p> Heldra s voice came, heavily, solemnly,</p><p>with a curious bell-like tone sounding the </p><p>knell of doom incarnate: </p><p> "Michael Commnenus! This your pres-</p><p>ent body has never wrought me harm, </p><p>nor has it harmed any of these. It is not </p><p>with your body that we hold our feud. </p><p>Wherefore, your body shall go forth </p><p>from this cave as it entered—as hand- </p><p>some as ever, bearing no mark of scathe. </p><p> "But your niddering soul, O most ac-</p><p>cursed, shall be drawn from out its </p><p>earthly tenement this night and given </p><p>over to these souls you wronged, who </p><p>now await their victim and their ven- </p><p>geance! And I tell you, Michael Com- </p><p>mnenus, that what they have in store for </p><p>you will make the Hades of your religion </p><p>seem as a devoutly-to-be-desired para- </p><p>dise!” </p><p> Heldra stepped directly before Comm-</p><p>nenus. Her shapely white arms were out- </p><p>stretched, palms down, fingers stiffly ex- </p><p>tended. A queer, violet-tinged radiance </p><p>streamed from her fingers, gradually en- </p><p>veloping Commnenus—he began to </p><p>glow, as if he had been immersed and </p><p>had absorbed all his body could take </p><p>up. . . . </p><p> Heldra’s voice took on the tone of</p><p>finality: </p><p> "Michael Commnenus! Thou accursed</p><p>soul, by the power I hold, given me by </p><p>Hela’s self, I call you forth from your </p><p>hiding-place of flesh—come ye out!” </p><p> The living body never moved, but</p><p>from out its mouth emerged a faint sil- </p><p>very-tinted vapor flowing toward the </p><p>Alrutia-maid, and as it came, the violet </p><p>glow diminished. The accumulating sil- </p><p>very mist swirled and writhed, percep- </p><p>tibly taking on the semblance of the body </p><p>from whence it was being extracted. </p><p>There remained finally but a merest </p><p>thread of silvery shimmer connecting </p><p>soul and body. Heldra spoke beneath her </p><p>breath: </p><p> "One of you hew that cord asunder!”</p><p>A double-bladed Norse battle-ax </p><p>whirled and a ghostly voice croaked: </p><p>"Thor Hulf!” </p><p> Thor, the old Norse war-god, must</p><p>have helped, for the great ghost-ax evi- </p><p>dently encountered a solid cable well- </p><p>nigh as strong as tempered steel. Thrice </p><p>the ax rose and fell, driven by the swell- </p><p>ing thew's of the towering giant wielding </p><p>it, ere the silver cord was broken by the </p><p>blade. </p><p> A tittering giggle burst from the lips</p><p>of the present-day Michael Commnenus. </p><p> I realized with a sudden sickness at</p><p>the pit of my stomach that an utterly </p><p>mindless imbecile stood there, grinning </p><p>vacuously! </p><p> "That Thing” Heldra said, coldly</p><p>scornful as she pointed to the silvery </p><p>shining soul, "is yours, heroes! Do with </p><p>it as ye will!” </p><p> Two of the gigantic wraiths clamped</p><p>their great hands on its shoulders. It </p><p>turned a dull leaden-gray, the color of </p><p>abject fear. Cringing and squirming, it </p><p>was hustled aboard the ghostly dragon- </p><p>ship. The other ghost-vikings went </p><p>aboard, taking their places at the oars . ., </p><p>yet they waited. Heldra turned to me. </p><p> "Be free of the spell I laid upon you!”</p><p>Her tone was as gentle as it had been in </p><p>her sweetest moments while she dwelt in </p><p>my home as my niece. </p><p>I gasped, rose and stretched. I wanted </p><p>to be angry—and dared not. I’d seen </p><p>too much of her hellish powers to risk </p><p>incurring her displeasure. And reading </p><p>my mind, she laughed merrily.. </p><p>664 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> Then her cool, soft, white arms went</p><p>about my neck, her wondrous sapphire </p><p>eyes looked long and tenderly into mine </p><p>—and I will not write the message I </p><p>read in those softly shining orbs. Once </p><p>again her silvery voice spoke: </p><p> "Jarl Wulf Red-Brand! John Craig! I</p><p>am the grand-daughter of Ragnar Wave- </p><p>Flame! And once I went a-viking with </p><p>my three brothers, to far Byzantium. You </p><p>know that talc. Now, once I said that </p><p>Ragnar Wave-Flame never died. Also, </p><p>I said that I had dived into her sea-cave </p><p>and lain in her arms—and now I tell you </p><p>the rest of that mystery: with her breath </p><p>she entered this my body where ever </p><p>since we have dwelt as one soul. I need- </p><p>ed aid in seeking my vengeance, for it </p><p>was after I’d escaped the clutches of the </p><p>Commnenus, and had passed through ad- </p><p>ventures incredible while making my </p><p>way back to the Norse-lands—and my </p><p>spirit was very bitter. And when I </p><p>sought her council, Ragnar helped </p><p>me. . . . </p><p> "This now do I ask of you: Do you,</p><p>as I have sometimes thought, love me as </p><p>a man loves a maid? Reflect well, ere you </p><p>answer, and recall what I once showed </p><p>you in a mirror—I am older than you! </p><p>So, knowing that, despite my witcheries </p><p>of the long, bitter past, and those of to- </p><p>night, would you take me, were you and </p><p>I young once more?’’ </p><p> "By all the gods in Valhalla, and by</p><p>all the devils in Hela’s halls: yes!” My </p><p>reply was given without need of reflect- </p><p>ing, or counting cost. </p><p> "Then, in a day to come, you shall take</p><p>me—I swear it!” </p><p> Full upon my mouth she pressed her</p><p>scarlet lips, and a surging flame suffused </p><p>my entire body. Yet it was life—not </p><p>death. Against my chest I felt the pres- </p><p>sure of her swelling breasts, and fires un- </p><p>dreamable streamed from her heart to </p><p>mine. Time itself stood still. After an </p><p>eon or so she unwound her clinging arms </p><p>from about my neck and turned away,</p><p>and with never a backward glance she </p><p>entered that waiting, ghostly dragon-ship. </p><p>The oars dipped. . . . </p><p> "Juch! Hey! Sa-sa-sa! Hey-sa! Hey-sa!</p><p>Hey-sa! Hey-sa!” and repeated . . . and </p><p>again . . . until the faint, ghostly chant </p><p>was swallowed by distance. . . . </p><p> I left the cave.</p><p> The driveling idiot who had been</p><p>Michael Commnenus was already gone. </p><p>Later, the gossip ran that he’d "lost his </p><p>mind,” and that his embassy had re- </p><p>turned him to his own land.

"If your story is true, and you </p><p>do possess so manifestly absurd a secret, </p><p>why should you come to me?

"Then you admit that what </p><p>I	tell you is not wholly strange—you do</p><p>know something of this place already?” </p><p>"Suppose I do,” said the captain, un- </p><p>flinching. "That doesn’t prove that </p><p>you’re a philanthropic guide to what I’m </p><p>seeking. More likely you want to pump </p><p>me, as I said, then dispose of me and </p><p>get the goods for yourself.

This he flung casually on </p><p>the table, so that it lay in a fan of lamp- </p><p>light. </p><p> Captain Cartaret bent forward and</p><p>peered at the queer, metallic thing.

It was </p><p>here that the captain had first become in- </p><p>terested in archeology and the shadowy </p><p>realms of the occult which surround it. </p><p>From the vast desert of Arabia had come </p><p>intriguing tales as old as time; furtive </p><p>fables of mystic Irem, city of ancient </p><p>dread, and the lost legends of vanished </p><p>empires. He had spoken to the dreaming </p><p>dervishes whose hashish visions revealed </p><p>secrets of forgotten days, and had ex- </p><p>plored certain reputedly ghoul-ridden </p><p>tombs and burrows in the ruins of an </p><p>older Damascus than recorded history </p><p>knows. </p><p> In time, his retirement had brought</p><p>him to Egypt. Here in Cairo there was </p><p>access to still more secret lore. Egypt, </p><p>land of lurid curses and lost kings, has </p><p>ever harbored mad myths in its age-old </p><p>shadows. Cartaret had learned of priests </p><p>and pharaohs; of olden oracles, forgot- </p><p>ten sphinxes, fabulous pyramids, titanic </p><p>tombs. Civilization was but a cobweb </p><p>surface upon the sleeping face of Eternal </p><p>Mystery. Here, beneath the inscrutable </p><p>shadows of the pyramids, the old gods </p><p>still stalked in the old ways. The ghosts </p><p>of Set, Ra, Osiris, and Bubastis lurked </p><p>in desert ways; Horus, Isis, and Sebek yet </p><p>dwelt in the ruins of Thebes and Mem- </p><p>phis, or bided in the crumbling tombs </p><p>below the Valley of Kings. </p><p> Nowhere had the past survived as it</p><p>did in ageless Egypt. With every mum- </p><p>my, the Egyptologists uncovered a curse; </p><p>the solving of each ancient secret merely </p><p>uncovered a deeper, more perplexing rid- </p><p>dle. Who built the pylons of the tem- </p><p>ples? Why did the old kings rear the </p><p>pyramids? How did they work such mar- </p><p>vels? Were their curses potent still? </p><p>Where vanished the priests of Egypt? </p><p> These and a thousand other unan-</p><p>swered questions intrigued the mind of </p><p>Captain Cartaret. In his new-found lei- </p><p>sure he read and studied, talked with sci- </p><p>entists and savants. Ever the quest of </p><p>primal knowledge beckoned him on to </p><p>blacker brinks; he could slake his thirsty </p><p>soul only in stranger secrets, more dan- </p><p>gerous discoveries. </p><p> Many of the reputable authorities he</p><p>knew were open in their confessed opin- </p><p>ion that it was not well for meddlers to </p><p>pry too deeply beneath the surface. Curses </p><p>had come true with puzzling promptness, </p><p>and warning prophecies had been ful- </p><p>filled with a vengeance. It was not good </p><p>to profane the shrines of the old dark </p><p>gods who still dwelt within the land. </p><p> But the terrible lure of the forgotten</p><p>and the forbidden was a pulsing virus in </p><p>Cartaret’s blood. When he heard the leg- </p><p>end of Nephren-Ka, he naturally investi- </p><p>gated. </p><p> Nephren-Ka, according to authorita-</p><p>tive knowledge, was merely a mythical </p><p>figure. He was purported to have been a </p><p>Pharaoh of no known dynasty, a priestly </p><p>usurper of the throne. The most common </p><p>fables placed his reign in almost biblical </p><p>times. He was said to have been the last </p><p>and greatest of that Egyptian cult of </p><p>priest-sorcerers who for a time trans- </p><p>formed the recognized religion into a </p><p>dark and terrible thing. This cult, led </p><p>668 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>by the arch-hierophants of Bubastis, Anu- </p><p>bis, and Sebek, viewed their gods as the </p><p>representatives of actual Hidden Beings </p><p>—montsrous beast-men who shambled on </p><p>Earth in primal days. They accorded wor- </p><p>ship to the Elder One who is known to </p><p>myth as Nyarlathotep, the "Mighty Mes- </p><p>senger.” This abominable deity was said </p><p>to confer wizard's power upon receiving </p><p>human sacrifices; and while the evil </p><p>priests reigned supreme they temporarily </p><p>transformed the religion of Egypt into a </p><p>bloody shambles. With anthropomancy </p><p>and necrophilism they sought terrible </p><p>boons from their demons. </p><p> The tale goes that Nephren-Ka, on the</p><p>throne, renounced all religion save that </p><p>of Nyarlathotep. He sought the power of </p><p>prophecy, and built temples to the Blind </p><p>Ape of Truth. His utterly atrocious sacri- </p><p>fices at length provoked a revolt, and it is </p><p>said that the infamous Pharaoh was at </p><p>last dethroned. According to this ac- </p><p>count, the new ruler and his people im- </p><p>mediately destroyed all vestiges of the </p><p>former reign, demolished all temples and </p><p>idols of Nyarlathotep, and drove out the </p><p>wicked priests who prostituted their faith </p><p>to the carnivorous Bubastis, Anubis, and </p><p>Sebek. The Book of the Dead was then </p><p>amended so that all references to the Pha- </p><p>raoh Nephren-Ka and his accursed cults </p><p>;were deleted. </p><p> Thus, argues the legend, the furtive</p><p>faith was lost to reputable history. As </p><p>to Nephren-Ka himself, a strange ac- </p><p>count is given of his end. </p><p> The story ran that the dethroned Pha-</p><p>raoh fled to a spot adjacent to what is </p><p>now the modern city of Cairo. Here it </p><p>was his intention to embark with his re- </p><p>maining followers for a "westward isle.” </p><p>Historians believe that this "isle” wras </p><p>Britain, where some of the fleeing priests </p><p>of Bubastis actually settled. </p><p> But the Pharaoh was attacked and sur-</p><p>rounded, his escape blocked. It was then </p><p>that he had constructed a secret under- </p><p>ground tomb, in which he caused himself </p><p>and his followers to be interred alive.</p><p>With him, in this vivisepulture, he took </p><p>all his treasure and magical secrets, so </p><p>that nothing would remain for his ene- </p><p>mies to profit by. So cleverly did his re- </p><p>maining devotees contrive this secret </p><p>crypt that the attackers were never able </p><p>to discover the resting-place of the Black </p><p>Pharaoh. </p><p> Thus the legend rests. According to</p><p>common currency, the fable was handed </p><p>dow-n by the few remaining priests who </p><p>actually stayed on the surface to seal the </p><p>secret place; they and their descendants </p><p>were believed to have perpetuated the </p><p>story and the old faith of evil. </p><p>Following up this exceedingly un- </p><p>usual story, Cartaret delved into the </p><p>old tomes of the time. During a trip to </p><p>London he was fortunate enough to be </p><p>allowed an inspection of the unhallowed </p><p>and archaic Necronomicon of Abdul Al- </p><p>hazred. In it were further emendations. </p><p>One of his influential friends in the </p><p>Home Office, hearing of his interest, </p><p>managed to obtain for him a portion of </p><p>Ludvig Prinn’s evil and blasphemous De </p><p>Vermis Mysteriis, known more familiarly </p><p>to students of recondite arcana as Mys- </p><p>teries of the Worm. Here, in that greatly </p><p>disputed chapter on oriental myth entitled </p><p>Saracenic Rituals, Cartaret found still </p><p>more concrete elaborations of the Neph- </p><p>ren-Ka tale. </p><p> Prinn, who consorted with the me-</p><p>diaeval seers and prophets of Saracen </p><p>times in Egypt, gave a good deal of </p><p>prominence to the whispered hints of </p><p>Alexandrian necromancers and adepts. </p><p>They knew the story of Nephren-Ka, and </p><p>alluded to him as the Black Pharaoh. </p><p> Prinn’s account of the Pharaoh’s death</p><p>was much more elaborate. He claimed </p><p>that the secret tomb lay directly beneath </p><p>FANE OF THE BLACK PHARAOH </p><p>669 </p><p>Cairo itself, and professed to believe that </p><p>it had been opened and reached. He </p><p>hinted at the cult-survival mentioned in </p><p>the popular tales; spoke of a renegade </p><p>group of descendants whose priestly an- </p><p>cestors had interred the rest alive. They </p><p>were said to perpetuate the evil faith, and </p><p>to act as guardians of the dead Nephren- </p><p>Ka and his buried brethren, lest some </p><p>interloper discover and violate his resting- </p><p>place in the crypt. After the regular </p><p>cycle of seven thousand years, the Black </p><p>Pharaoh and his band would then arise </p><p>once more, and restore the dark glory of </p><p>the ancient faith. </p><p> The crypt itself, if Prinn is to be be-</p><p>lieved, was a most unusual place. Ne- </p><p>phren-Ka’s servants and slaves had build- </p><p>ed him a mighty sepulcher, and the bur- </p><p>rows were filled with the rich treasure of </p><p>his reign. All of the sacred images were </p><p>there, and the jeweled books of esoteric </p><p>wisdom reposed within. </p><p> Most peculiarly did the account dwell</p><p>on Nephren-Ka’s search for the Truth </p><p>and the Power of Prophecy. It was said </p><p>that before he died down in the dark- </p><p>ness, he conjured up the earthly image </p><p>of Nyarlathotep in a final gigantic sacri- </p><p>fice; and that the god granted him his </p><p>desires. Nephren-Ka had stood before </p><p>the images of the Blind Ape of Truth and </p><p>received the gift of divination over the </p><p>gory bodies of a hundred willing victims. </p><p>Then, in nightmare manner, Prinn re- </p><p>counts that the entombed Pharaoh wan- </p><p>dered among his dead companions and </p><p>inscribed on the twisted walls of his tomb </p><p>the secrets of the future. In pictures and </p><p>ideographs he wrote the history of days </p><p>to come, revelling in omniscient knowl- </p><p>edge till the end. He scrawled the desti- </p><p>nies of kings to come; painted the tri- </p><p>umphs and the dooms of unborn empires. </p><p>Then, as the blackness of death shrouded </p><p>his sight, and palsy wrenched the brush </p><p>from his fingers, he betook himself in </p><p>peace to his sarcophagus, and there died. </p><p> So said Ludvig Prinn, he that consorted</p><p>with ancient seers. Nephren-Ka lay in his </p><p>buried burrows, guarded by the priestly</p><p>cult that still survived on Earth, and fur- </p><p>ther protected by enchantments in his </p><p>tomb below. He had fulfilled his desires </p><p>at the end—he had known Truth, and </p><p>written the lore of the future on the </p><p>nighted walls of his own catacomb. </p><p> Cartaret had read all this with con-</p><p>flicting emotions. How he would like to </p><p>find that tomb, if it existed! What a sen- </p><p>sation—he would revolutionize anthro- </p><p>pology, ethnology! </p><p> Of course, the legend had its absurd</p><p>points. Cartaret, for all his research, was </p><p>not superstitious. He didn’t believe the </p><p>bogus balderdash about Nyarlathotep, the </p><p>Blind Ape of Truth, or the priestly cult. </p><p>That part about the gift of prophecy was </p><p>sheer drivel. </p><p> Such things were commonplace. There</p><p>were many savants who had attempted to </p><p>prove that the pyramids, in their geo- </p><p>metrical construction, were archeological </p><p>and architectural prophecies of days to </p><p>come. With elaborate and convincing </p><p>skill, they attempted to show that, sym- </p><p>bolically interpreted, the great tombs held </p><p>the key to history, that they allegorically </p><p>foretold the Middle Ages, the Renais- </p><p>sance, the Great War. </p><p> This, Cartaret believed, was rubbish.</p><p>And the utterly absurd notion that a dy- </p><p>ing fanatic had been gifted with pro- </p><p>phetic power and scrawled the future his- </p><p>tory of the world on his tomb as a last </p><p>gesture before death—that was impos- </p><p>sible to swallow. </p><p> Nevertheless, despite his skeptical atti-</p><p>tude, Captain Cartaret wanted to find the </p><p>tomb, if it existed. He had returned to </p><p>Egypt with that intention, and immedi- </p><p>ately set to work. So far he had a number </p><p>of clues and hints. If the machinery of </p><p>670 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>his investigation did not collapse, it was </p><p>now only a matter of days before he </p><p>would discover the actual entrance to the </p><p>spot itself. Then he intended to enlist </p><p>proper Governmental aid and make his </p><p>discovery public to all. </p><p> This much he now told the silent Arab</p><p>who had come out of the night with a </p><p>strange proposal and a weird credential: </p><p>the seal of the Black Pharaoh, Ne- </p><p>phren-Ka. </p><p>3 </p><p>WHEN Cartaret finished his sum- </p><p>mary, he glanced at the dark stran- </p><p>ger in interrogation. </p><p> "What next?” he asked.</p><p> “Follow me,” said the other, urbanely.</p><p>"I shall lead you to the spot you seek.” </p><p>"Now?” gasped Cartaret. The other </p><p>nodded. </p><p> "But—it’s too sudden! I mean, the</p><p>whole thing is like a dream. You come </p><p>out of the night, unbidden and unknown, </p><p>show me the Seal, and graciously offer to </p><p>grant me my desires. Why? It doesn’t </p><p>make sense.” </p><p> "This makes sense.” The grave Arab</p><p>indicated the black Seal. </p><p> "Yes,” admitted Cartaret. "But—how</p><p>can I trust you? Why must I go now? </p><p>Wouldn’t it be wiser to wait, and get the </p><p>proper authorities behind us? Won’t </p><p>there be need of excavation; aren’t there </p><p>necessary instruments to take?” </p><p> "No.” The other spread his palms up-</p><p>ward. "Just come.” </p><p> "Look here.” Cartaret’s suspicion crys-</p><p>tallized in his sharp tones. "How do I </p><p>know this isn’t a trap? Why should you </p><p>come to me this way? Who the devil are </p><p>you?” </p><p> "Patience.” The dark man smiled. "I</p><p>shall explain all. I have listened to your </p><p>accounts of the ’legend’ with great inter-</p><p>est, and while your £*ds are clear, your </p><p>own view of them is mistaken. The ‘leg- </p><p>end’ you have learned of is true—all of </p><p>it. Nephren-Ka did write the future on </p><p>the walls of his tomb when he died; he </p><p>did possess the power of divination, and </p><p>the priests who buried him formed a cult </p><p>which did survive.” </p><p> "Yes?” Cartaret was impressed, despite</p><p>himself. </p><p> "I am one of those priests.” The</p><p>words stabbed like swords in the white </p><p>man’s brain. </p><p> "Do not look so shocked. It is the</p><p>truth. I am a descendant of the original </p><p>cult of Nephren-Ka, one of those inner </p><p>initiates who have kept the' legend alive. </p><p>I worship the Power which the Black </p><p>Pharaoh received, and I worship the god </p><p>Nyarlathotep who accorded that Power </p><p>to him. To us believers, the most sacred </p><p>truth lies in the hieroglyphs inscribed by </p><p>the divinely gifted Pharaoh before he </p><p>died. Throughout the ages, we guardian </p><p>priests have watched history unfold, and </p><p>always it has agreed with the ideographs </p><p>on those tunneled walls. We believe. </p><p> "It is because of our belief that I have</p><p>sought you out. For within the secret </p><p>crypt of the Black Pharaoh it is written </p><p>upon the walls of the future that you shall </p><p>descend there.” </p><p> Stunning silence.</p><p> "Do you mean to say,” Carteret gasped,</p><p>"that those pictures show me discovering </p><p>the spot?” </p><p> "They do,” assented the dark man,</p><p>slowly. "That is why I came to you un- </p><p>bidden. You shall come with me and ful- </p><p>fill the prophecy tonight, as it is writ- </p><p>ten.” </p><p> "Suppose I don’t come?” flashed Cap-</p><p>tain Cartaret, suddenly. "What about </p><p>your prophecy then?” </p><p> The Arab smiled. "You’ll come,” he</p><p>said. "You know that.” </p><p> Cartaret realized that it was so. Noth-</p><p>FANE OF THE BLACK PHARAOH </p><p>671 </p><p>ing could keep him away from this amaz- </p><p>ing discovery. A thought struck him. </p><p> "If this wall really records the details</p><p>of the future,” he began, "perhaps you </p><p>can tell me a little about my own coming </p><p>history. Will this discovery make me fa- </p><p>mous? Will I return again to the spot? </p><p>Is it written that I am to bring the secret </p><p>of Nephren-Ka to light?” </p><p> The dark man looked grave. "That I</p><p>do not know,” he admitted. "I neglected </p><p>to tell you something about the Walls of </p><p>Truth. My ancestor—he who first de- </p><p>scended into the secret spot after it had </p><p>been sealed, he who first looked upon the </p><p>work of prophecy—did a needful thing. </p><p>Deeming that such wisdom was not for </p><p>lesser mortals, he piously covered the </p><p>walls with concealing tapestry. Thus </p><p>none might look upon the future too far. </p><p>As time passed, the tapestry was drawn </p><p>back to keep pace with the actual events </p><p>of history, and always they have coincided </p><p>with the hieroglyphs. Through the ages, </p><p>it has always been the duty of one priest </p><p>to descend to the secret tomb each day </p><p>and draw back the tapestry so as to reveal </p><p>the events of the day that follows. Now, </p><p>during my life, that is my mission. My </p><p>fellows devote their time to the needful </p><p>rites of worship in hidden places. I alone </p><p>descend the concealed passage daily and </p><p>draw back the curtain on the Walls of </p><p>Truth. When I die, another will take my </p><p>place. Understand me—the writing does </p><p>not minutely concern every single event; </p><p>merely those which affect the history and </p><p>destiny of Egypt itself. Today, my friend, </p><p>it was revealed that you should descend </p><p>and enter into the place of your desire. </p><p>What the morrow holds in store for you </p><p>I cannot say, until the curtain is drawn </p><p>once more.” </p><p> Cartaret sighed. "I suppose that there</p><p>is nothing else left but for me to go, </p><p>then.” His eagerness was ill dissembled. </p><p>The dark man observed this at once, and </p><p>smiled cynically, while he strode to the </p><p>door. </p><p> "Follow me,” he commanded.</p><p>TO CAPTAIN CARTARET that walk </p><p>through the moonlit streets of Cairo </p><p>was blurred in chaotic dream. His guide </p><p>led him into labyrinths of looming shad- </p><p>ows; they wandered through the twisted </p><p>native quarters and passed through a </p><p>maze of unfamiliar alleys and thorough- </p><p>fares. Cartaret strode mechanically at the </p><p>dark stranger’s heels, his thoughts avid </p><p>for the great triumph to come. </p><p> He hardly noticed their passage through</p><p>a dingy courtyard; when his companion </p><p>drew up before an ancient well and </p><p>pressed a niche revealing the passage be- </p><p>neath, he followed him as a matter of </p><p>course. From somewhere the Arab had </p><p>produced a flashlight. Its faint beam al- </p><p>most rebounded from the murk of the </p><p>inky tunnel. </p><p> Together they descended a thousand</p><p>stairs, into the ageless and eternal dark- </p><p>ness that broods beneath. Like a blind </p><p>man, Cartaret stumbled down—down </p><p>into the depths of three thousand van- </p><p>ished years. </p><p>4 </p><p>The temple was entered—the subter- </p><p>ranean temple-tomb of Nephren-Ka. </p><p>Through silver gates the priest passed, </p><p>his dazed companion following behind. </p><p> Cartaret stood in a vast chamber, the</p><p>niched walls of which were lined with </p><p>sarcophagi. </p><p> "They hold the mummies of the in-</p><p>terred priests and servants,” explained his </p><p>guide. </p><p> Strange were the mummy-cases of</p><p>Nephren-Ka’s followers, not like those </p><p>known to Egyptology. The carven covers </p><p>bore no recognized, conventional features </p><p>as was the usual custom; instead they </p><p>672 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>presented the strange, grinning counte- </p><p>nances of demons and creatures of fable. </p><p>Jeweled eyes stared mockingly from the </p><p>black visages of gargoyles spawned in a </p><p>sculptor’s nightmare. From every side of </p><p>the room those eyes shone through the </p><p>shadows; unwinking, unchanging, omnis- </p><p>cient in this little world of the dead. </p><p> Cartaret stirred uneasily. Emerald eyes</p><p>of death, ruby eyes of malevolence, yel- </p><p>low orbs of mockery; everywhere they </p><p>confronted him. He was glad when his </p><p>guide led him forward at last, so that the </p><p>incongruous rays of the flashlight shone </p><p>on the entrance beyond. A moment later </p><p>his relief was dissipated by the sight of a </p><p>new horror confronting him at the inner </p><p>doorway. </p><p> Two gigantic figures shambled there,</p><p>guarding either side of the opening—two </p><p>monstrous, troglodytic figures. Great go- </p><p>rillas they were; enormous apes, carved in </p><p>simian semblance from black stone. They </p><p>faced the doorway, squatting on mighty </p><p>haunches, their huge, hairy arms upraised </p><p>in menace. Their glittering faces were </p><p>brutally alive; they grinned, bare-fanged, </p><p>with idiotic glee. And they were blind— </p><p>eyeless and blind. </p><p> There was a terrible allegory in these</p><p>figures which Carteret knew only too </p><p>well. The blind apes were Destiny per- </p><p>sonified; a hulking, mindless Destiny </p><p>whose sightless, stupid gropings trampled </p><p>on the dreams of men and altered their </p><p>lives by aimless flailings of purposeless </p><p>paws. Thus did they control reality. </p><p> These were the Blind Apes of Truth,</p><p>according to the ancient legend; the sym- </p><p>bols of the old gods worshipped by </p><p>Nephren-Ka. </p><p> Cartaret thought of the myths once</p><p>more, and trembled. If tales were true, </p><p>Nephren-Ka had offered up that final </p><p>mighty sacrifice upon the obscene laps of </p><p>these evil idols; offered them up to Nyar- </p><p>lathotep, and buried the dead in the </p><p>mummy-cases set here in the niches. </p><p>Then he had gone on to his own sepul-</p><p>cher within. </p><p> The guide proceeded stolidly past the</p><p>looming figures. Cartaret, dissembling </p><p>his dismay, started to follow. For a mo- </p><p>ment his feet refused to cross that grue- </p><p>somely guarded threshold into the room </p><p>beyond. He stared upward to the eyeless, </p><p>ogreish faces that leered down from diz- </p><p>zying heights, with the feeling that he </p><p>walked in realms of sheer nightmare. But </p><p>the huge arms beckoned him on; the un- </p><p>seeing faces were convulsed in a smile of </p><p>mocking invitation. </p><p> The legends were true. The tomb ex-</p><p>isted. Would it not be better to turn back </p><p>now, seek sane aid, and return again to </p><p>this spot? Besides, what unguessed terror </p><p>might not lair in the realms beyond; </p><p>what horror spawn in the sable shadows </p><p>of Nephren-Ka’s inner, secret sepulcher? </p><p>All reason urged him to call out to the </p><p>strange priest and retreat to safety. </p><p> But the voice of reason was but a</p><p>hushed and awe-stricken whisper here in </p><p>the brooding burrows of the past. This </p><p>was a realm of ancient shadow, where an- </p><p>tique evil ruled. Here the incredible was </p><p>real, and there was a potent fascination </p><p>in fear itself. </p><p> Cartaret knew that he must go on; cu-</p><p>riosity, cupidity, the lust for concealed </p><p>knowledge—all impelled him. And the </p><p>Blind Apes grinned their challenge, or </p><p>command. </p><p>The priest entered the third chamber, </p><p>and Cartaret followed. Crossing the </p><p>threshold, he plunged into an abyss of </p><p>unreality. </p><p> The room was lighted by braziers set</p><p>in a thousand stations; their glow bathed </p><p>the enormous burrow with fiery lumi- </p><p>nance. Captain Cartaret, his head reeling </p><p>from the heat and mephitic miasma of </p><p> W. T.—2</p><p>FANE OF THE BLACK PHARAOH </p><p>673 </p><p>the place, was thus able to see the entire </p><p>extent of this incredible cavern. </p><p> Seemingly endless, a vast corridor</p><p>stretched on a downward slant into the </p><p>earth beyond—a vast corridor, utterly </p><p>barren, save for the winking red braziers </p><p>along the walls. Their flaming reflections </p><p>cast grotesque shadows that glimmered </p><p>with unnatural life. Cartaret felt as </p><p>though he were gazing on the entrance to </p><p>Karneter—the mythical underworld of </p><p>Egyptian lore. </p><p> "Here we are,” said his guide, softly.</p><p> The unexpected sound of a human</p><p>voice was startling. For some reason, it </p><p>frightened Cartaret more than he cared </p><p>to admit; he had fallen into a vague ac- </p><p>ceptance of these scenes as being part of </p><p>a fantastic dream. Now, the concrete </p><p>clarity of a spoken word only confirmed </p><p>an eery reality. </p><p> Yes, here they were, in the spot of</p><p>legend, the place known to Alhazred, </p><p>Prinn, and all the dark delvers into un- </p><p>hallowed history. The tale of Nephren- </p><p>Ka was true, and if so, what about the </p><p>rest of this strange priest’s statements? </p><p>What about the Walls of Truth, on which </p><p>the Black Pharaoh had recorded the fu- </p><p>ture, had foretold Cartaret’s own advent </p><p>on the secret spot? </p><p> As if in answer to these inner whis-</p><p>pers, the guide smiled. </p><p> "Come, Captain Cartaret; do you not</p><p>wish to examine the walls more closely?” </p><p> The captain did not wish to examine</p><p>the walls; desperately, he did not. For </p><p>they, if in existence, would confirm the </p><p>ghastly horror that gave them being. If </p><p>they existed, it meant that the whole evil </p><p>legend was real; that Nephren-Ka, Black </p><p>Pharaoh of Egypt, had indeed sacrificed </p><p>to the dread dark gods, and that they had </p><p>answered his prayer. Captain Cartaret did </p><p>not greatly wish to believe in such utterly </p><p>W. T.—3 </p><p>blasphemous abominations as Nyarlatho-</p><p>tep. </p><p> He sparred for time.</p><p> "Where is the tomb of Nephren-Ka</p><p>himself?” he asked. "Where are the </p><p>treasure and the ancient books?” </p><p> The guide extended a lean forefinger.</p><p> "At the end of this hall,” he ex-</p><p>claimed. </p><p> Peering down the infinity of lighted</p><p>walls, Cartaret indeed fancied that his </p><p>eyes could detect a dark blur of objects </p><p>in the dim distance. </p><p> "Let us go there,” he said.</p><p> The guide shrugged. He turned, and</p><p>his feet moved over the velvet dust. </p><p> Cartaret followed, as if drugged.</p><p> "The walls,” he thought. "I must not</p><p>look at the walls. The Walls of Truth. </p><p>The Black Pharaoh sold his soul to Nyar- </p><p>lathotep and received the gift of prophe- </p><p>cy. Before he died here he wrote the fu- </p><p>ture of Egypt on the walls. I must not </p><p>look, lest I believe. I must not know.” </p><p> Red lights glittered on either side.</p><p>Step after step, light after light. Glare, </p><p>gloom, glare, gloom, glare. </p><p> The lights beckoned, enticed, attracted.</p><p>"Look at us,” they commanded. "See, </p><p>dare to see'all.” </p><p> Cartaret followed his silent conductor.</p><p> "Look!” flashed the lights.</p><p> Cartaret’s eyes grew glassy. His head</p><p>throbbed. The gleaming of the lights </p><p>was mesmeric; they hypnotized with their </p><p>allure. </p><p> "Look!”</p><p> Would this great hall never end? No;</p><p>there were thousands of feet to go. </p><p> "Look!” challenged the leaping lights.</p><p> Red serpent eyes in the underground</p><p>dark; eyes of tempters, brit gers of black </p><p>knowledge. </p><p> "Look! Wisdom! Know!” winked the</p><p>lights. </p><p> They flamed in Cartaret’s brain. Why</p><p>not look—it was so easy? Why fear? </p><p>.674 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>Why? His dazed mind repeated the ques- </p><p>tion. Eadi following flare of fire weak- </p><p>ened the question. </p><p> At last, Cartaret looked.</p><p>5 </p><p>Mad minutes passed before he was </p><p>able to speak. Then he mumbled </p><p>in a voice audible only to himself. </p><p>"True,” he whispered. "All true.” </p><p> He stared at the towering wall to his</p><p>left, limned in red radiance. It was an </p><p>interminable Bayeux tapestry carved in </p><p>stone. The drawing was crude, in black </p><p>and white, but it frightened. This was no </p><p>ordinary Egyptian picture-writing; it was </p><p>not in the fantastic, symbolical style of </p><p>ordinary hieroglyphics. That was the ter- </p><p>rible part: Nephren-Ka was a realist. His </p><p>men looked like men, his buildings were </p><p>buildings. There was nothing here but a </p><p>representation of stark reality, and it was </p><p>dreadful to see. </p><p> For at the point where Cartaret first</p><p>summoned sufficient courage to gaze he </p><p>stared at an unmistakable tableau involv- </p><p>ing Crusaders and Saracens, </p><p> Crusaders of the Thirteenth Century—^</p><p>yet Nephren-Ka had then been dust for </p><p>nearly two thousand years! </p><p> The pictures were small, yet vivid and</p><p>distinct; they seemed to flow along quite </p><p>effortlessly on the wall, one scene blend- </p><p>ing into another as though they had been </p><p>drawn in unbroken continuity. It was as </p><p>though the artist had not stopped once </p><p>during his work; as though he had untir- </p><p>ingly proceeded to cover this gigantic hall </p><p>in a single supernatural effort. </p><p> That was it—a single supernatural ef-</p><p>fort! </p><p> Cartaret could not doubt. Rationalize</p><p>all he would, it was impossible to believe </p><p>that these drawings were trumped up by </p><p>any group of artists. It was one man’s </p><p>work. And the unerring horrid consist-</p><p>ency of it; the calculated picturization of </p><p>the most vital and important phases of </p><p>Egyptian history could have been set </p><p>down in such accurate order only by a </p><p>historical authority or a prophet. Ne- </p><p>phren-Ka had been given the gift of </p><p>prophecy. And so ... </p><p> As he ruminated in growing dread,</p><p>Cartaret and his guide proceeded. Now </p><p>that he had looked, a Medusian fascina- </p><p>tion held the man’s eyes to the wall. He </p><p>walked with history tonight; history and </p><p>red nightmare. Flaming figures leered </p><p>from every side. </p><p> He saw the rise of the Mameluke Em-</p><p>pire, looked on the despots and the ty- </p><p>rants of the East. Not all of what he saw </p><p>was familiar to Cartaret, for history has </p><p>its forgotten pages. Besides, the scenes </p><p>changed and varied at almost every step, </p><p>and it was quite confusing. There was </p><p>one picture interspersed with an Alexan- </p><p>drian court motif which depicted a cata- </p><p>comb evidently in some vaults beneath the </p><p>city. Here were gathered a number of </p><p>men in robes which bore a curious simi- </p><p>larity to those of Cartaret’s present guide. </p><p>They were conversing with a tall, white- </p><p>bearded man whose crudely drawn figure </p><p>seemed to exude an uncanny aura of black </p><p>and baleful power. </p><p> "Ludvig Prinn,” said the guide, softly,</p><p>noting Cartaret’s stare. "He mingled </p><p>■with our priests, you know.” </p><p> For some reason the depiction of this</p><p>almost legendary seer stirred Cartaret </p><p>more deeply than any other hitherto re- </p><p>vealed terror. The casual inclusion of the </p><p>infamous sorcerer in the procession of ac- </p><p>tual history hinted at dire things; it was </p><p>as though Cartaret had read a prosaic bi- </p><p>ography of Satan in Who's Who. </p><p> Nevertheless, with a sort of heartsick</p><p>craving his eyes continued to search the </p><p>walls as they walked onward to the still </p><p>indeterminate end of the long red-illu- </p><p>mined chamber in whidi Nephren-Ka </p><p>FANE OF THE BLACK PHARAOH </p><p>675 </p><p>was interred. The guide—priest, now, </p><p>for Cartaret no longer doubted—pro- </p><p>ceeded softly, but stole covert glances at </p><p>the white man as he led the way. </p><p> Captain Cartaret walked through a</p><p>dream. Only the walls were real now: </p><p>the Walls of Truth. He saw the Othmans </p><p>rise and flourish, looked on forgotten bat- </p><p>tles and unremembered kings. Often </p><p>there recurred in the sequence a scene de- </p><p>picting the priests of Nephren-Ka s ow'n </p><p>furtive cult. They were shown amidst the </p><p>disquieting surroundings of catacombs </p><p>and tombs, engaged in unsavory occupa- </p><p>tions and revolting pleasures. The cam- </p><p>era-film of time rolled on; Captain Car- </p><p>taret and his companion walked on. Still </p><p>the walls told their story. </p><p> There was one small division of the</p><p>wall which portrayed the priests conduct- </p><p>ing a man in Elizabethan costume </p><p>through what seemed to be a pyramid. It </p><p>was eery to see the gallant in his finery </p><p>pictured amidst the ruins of ancient </p><p>Egypt, and it was very dreadful indeed to </p><p>almost watch, like an unseen observer, </p><p>when a stealthy priest knifed the English- </p><p>man in the back as he bent over a mum- </p><p>my-case. </p><p> What now impressed Cartaret was the</p><p>infinitude of detail in each pictured frag- </p><p>ment. The features of all the men were </p><p>almost photographically exact; the draw- </p><p>ing, while crude, was life-like and real- </p><p>istic. Even the furniture and background </p><p>of every scene were correct. There was </p><p>no doubting the authenticity of it all, and </p><p>no doubting of the veracity thereby im- </p><p>plied. But—what was worse—there was </p><p>no doubting that this work could not </p><p>have been done by any normal artist, </p><p>however learned, unless he had seen it </p><p>all. </p><p> Nephren-Ka had seen it all in pro-</p><p>phetic vision, after his sacrifice to Nyar- </p><p>lathotep. </p><p> Cartaret was looking at truths inspired</p><p>by a demon. . . . </p><p> On and on, to the flaming fane of wor-</p><p>ship and death at the end of the hall. </p><p>History progressed as he walked. Now </p><p>he was looking at a period of Egyptian </p><p>lore that was almost contemporary. The </p><p>figure of Napoleon appeared. </p><p> The battle of Aboukir . . . the massacre</p><p>of the pyramids . . . the downfall of the </p><p>Mameluke horsemen . . . the entrance to </p><p>Cairo. . . . </p><p> Once again, a catacomb with priests.</p><p>And three figures, white men, in French </p><p>military regalia of the period.. The priests </p><p>were leading them into a red room. The </p><p>Frenchmen were surprized, overcome, </p><p>slaughtered. </p><p> It was vaguely familiar. Cartaret was</p><p>recalling what he knew of Napoleon’s </p><p>commission; he had appointed savants </p><p>and scientists to investigate the tombs </p><p>and pyramids of the land. The Rosetta </p><p>stone had been discovered, and other </p><p>things. Quite likely the three men shown </p><p>had blundered onto a mystery the priests </p><p>of Nephren-Ka had not wanted to have </p><p>unveiled. Hence they had been lured to </p><p>death as the walls showed. It was quite </p><p>familiar—but there was another famili- </p><p>arity which Cartaret could not place. </p><p>They moved on, and the years rushed </p><p>by in panorama. The Turks, the </p><p>English, Gordon, the plundering of the </p><p>pyramids, the World War. And ever so </p><p>often, a picture of the priests of Nephren- </p><p>Ka and a strange white man in some cata- </p><p>comb or vault. Always the white man </p><p>died. It was all familiar. </p><p> Cartaret looked up, and saw that he</p><p>and the priest were very near to the black- </p><p>ness at the end of the great fiery hall. </p><p>Only a hundred steps or so, in fact. The </p><p>priest, face hidden in his burnoose, was </p><p>beckoning him on. </p><p> Cartaret looked at the wall. The pic-</p><p>676 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>tures were almost ended. But no—just </p><p>ahead was a great curtain of crimson vel- </p><p>vet on a ceiling-rack which ran off into </p><p>the blackness and reappeared from shad- </p><p>ows on the opposite side of the room to </p><p>cover that wall. </p><p> "The future,” explained his guide.</p><p>And Captain Cartaret remembered that </p><p>the priest had told how each day he drew </p><p>back the curtain a bit so that the future </p><p>was always revealed just one day ahead. </p><p>He remembered something else, and has- </p><p>tily glanced at the last visible section of </p><p>the Wall of Truth next to the curtain. </p><p>He gasped. </p><p> It was true! Almost as though gazing</p><p>into a miniature mirror he found himself </p><p>staring into his own face! </p><p> Line for line, feature for feature, pos-</p><p>ture for posture, he and the priest of Ne- </p><p>phren-Ka were shown standing together </p><p>in this red chamber just as they were </p><p>now. </p><p> The red chamber . . . familiarity. The</p><p>Elizabethan man with the priests of Ne- </p><p>phren-Ka were in a catacomb when the </p><p>man was murdered. The French scientists </p><p>were in a red chamber when they died. </p><p>Other later Egyptologists had been shown </p><p>in a red chamber with the priests, and </p><p>they too had been slain. The red cham- </p><p>ber! Not familiarity but similarity! They </p><p>had been in this chamber! And now he </p><p>stood here, with a priest of Nephren-Ka. </p><p>The others had died because they had </p><p>known too much. Too much about what </p><p>—Nephren-Ka? </p><p> A terrible suspicion began to formu-</p><p>late into hideous reality. The priests of </p><p>Nephren-Ka protected their own. This </p><p>tomb of their dead leaders was also their </p><p>fane, their temple. When intruders stum- </p><p>bled onto the secret, they lured them </p><p>down here and killed them lest others </p><p>learn too much. </p><p> Had not he come in the same way?</p><p> The priest stood silent as he gazed at</p><p>the Wall of Truth. </p><p> "Midnight,” he said softly. "I must</p><p>draw back the curtain to reveal yet an- </p><p>other day before we go on. You ex- </p><p>pressed a wish, Captain Cartaret, to see </p><p>what the future holds in store for you. </p><p>Now that wish shall be granted.” </p><p> With a sweeping gesture he flung the</p><p>curtain back along the wall for a foot. </p><p>Then he moved, swiftly. </p><p> One hand leapt from the burnoose. A</p><p>gleaming knife flashed through the air, </p><p>drawing red fire from the lamps, then </p><p>sank into Cartaret’s back, drawing redder </p><p>blood. </p><p> With a single groan, the white man</p><p>fell. In his eyes there was a look of su- </p><p>preme horror, not born of death alone. </p><p>For as he fell, Captain Cartaret read his </p><p>future in the Walls of Truth, and it con- </p><p>firmed a madness that could not be. </p><p> As Captain Cartaret died he looked at</p><p>the picture of his next hours of existence </p><p>and saiv himself being knifed by the </p><p>priest of Nephren-Ka. </p><p> The priest vanished from the silent</p><p>tomb, just as the last flicker of dying eyes </p><p>showed to Cartaret the picture of a still </p><p>white body—his body—lying in death </p><p>before the Wall of Truth. </p><p>Vke /Black </p><p>"The droning voice ringing in his ears issued </p><p>from this nightmare creature." </p><p>Stone Statue </p><p>By MARY ELIZABETH COUNSELMAN </p><p>An amazing tale of weird sculpture—the story of a weird deception </p><p>practised on the world by an obscure artist—by the </p><p>author of ”The Three Marked Pennies” </p><p>IRECTORS,	as one might ask it of a true genius!—if</p><p>Museum of Fine Arts,	I would do a statue of myself to be placed</p><p>Boston, Mass.	among the great in your illustrious mu-</p><p>r .	seum.

It will ex- </p><p>plain everything. And having written it, </p><p>I shall then atone for my sin in (to you, </p><p>perhaps) a horribly ironic manner but </p><p>(to me) one that is most fitting. </p><p> Let me go back to that miserable sleet-</p><p>lashed afternoon as I came into the hall </p><p>of Mrs. Bates’s rooming-house—a crawl- </p><p>ing, filthy hovel for the poverty-stricken, </p><p>like myself, who were too proud to go on </p><p>relief. When I stumbled in, drenched </p><p>and dizzy with hunger, our landlady’s </p><p>ample figure was blocking the hallway. </p><p>She was arguing with a tall, shabbily </p><p>dressed young man whose face I was cer- </p><p>tain I had seen somewhere before. </p><p> "Just a week,” his deep, pleasant voice</p><p>was beseeching the old harridan. "I’ll </p><p>pay you double at the end of that time, </p><p>just as soon as I can put over a deal I </p><p>have in mind.” </p><p> I paused, staring at him covertly while</p><p>I shook the sleet from my hat-brim. Fine </p><p>gray eyes met mine across the landlady's </p><p>head—haggard now, and overbright with </p><p>suppressed excitement. There was </p><p>strength, character, in that face under its </p><p>stubble of mahogany-brown beard. There </p><p>was, too, a firm set to the man’s shoulders </p><p>and beautifully formed head. Here, I told </p><p>myself, was someone who had lived all </p><p>his life with dangerous adventure, some- </p><p>one whose clean-cut features, even under </p><p>that growth of beard, seemed vaguely </p><p>familiar to my sculptor’s-eye for detail. </p><p> "Not one day, no sirree!” Mrs. Bates</p><p>had folded her arms stubbornly. A </p><p>week’s rent in advance, or ye don’t step</p><p>foot into one o’ my rooms!” </p><p> On impulse I moved forward, digging</p><p>into my pocket. I smiled at the young </p><p>man and thrust almost my last two dol- </p><p>lars into the landlady’s hand. Smirking, </p><p>she bobbed off and left me alone with </p><p>the stranger. </p><p> "You shouldn’t have done that,” he</p><p>sighed, and gripped my hand hard. </p><p>"Thanks, old man. I’ll repay you next </p><p>week, though. Next week,” he whis- </p><p>pered, and his eyes took on a glow of </p><p>anticipation, "I’ll write you a check for a </p><p>thousand dollars. Two thousand!” </p><p> He laughed delightedly at my quizzical</p><p>expression and plunged out into the </p><p>storm again, whistling. </p><p> In that moment his identity struck me</p><p>like a blow. Paul Kennicott—the young </p><p>aviator whose picture had been on the </p><p>front page of every newspaper in the </p><p>country a few months ago! His plane </p><p>had crashed somewhere in the Brazilian </p><p>wilds, and the nation mourned him and </p><p>his co-pilot for dead. Why was he sneak- </p><p>ing back into New York like a criminal— </p><p>penniless, almost hysterical with excite- </p><p>ment, with an air of secrecy about him— </p><p>to hide himself here in the slum district? </p><p>I climb ED the rickety stairs to my shab- </p><p>by room and was plying the chisel </p><p>half-heartedly on my Dancing Group, </p><p>when suddenly I became aware of a </p><p>peculiar buzzing sound, like an angry bee </p><p>shut up in a jar. I slapped my ears sev- </p><p>eral times, annoyed, believing the noise </p><p>to be in my own head. But it kept on, </p><p>growing louder by the moment. </p><p> It seemed to come from the hall; and</p><p>simultaneously I heard the stair-steps </p><p>creak just outside my room. </p><p> Striding to the door, I jerked it open—</p><p>to see Paul Kennicott tiptoeing up the </p><p>stairs in stealthy haste. He started vio- </p><p>THE BLACK STONE STATUE </p><p>679 </p><p>lently at sight of me and attempted to </p><p>hide under his coat an odd black box he </p><p>was carrying. </p><p> But it was too large: almost two feet</p><p>square, roughly fashioned of wood and </p><p>the canvas off an airplane wing. But this </p><p>was not immediately apparent, for the </p><p>whole thing seemed to be covered with a </p><p>coat of shiny black enamel. When it </p><p>bumped against the balustrade, however, </p><p>it gave a solid metallic sound, unlike </p><p>cloth-covered wood. That humming noise, </p><p>I was sharply aware, came from inside </p><p>the box. </p><p> I stepped out into the hall and stood</p><p>blocking the passage rather grimly. </p><p> "Look here,” I snapped. "I know</p><p>who you are, Kennicott, but I don’t know </p><p>why you’re hiding out like this. What’s </p><p>it all about? You’ll tell me, or I’ll turn </p><p>you over to the police!” </p><p> Panic leaped into his eyes. They plead-</p><p>ed with me silently for an instant, and </p><p>then we heard the plodding footsteps of </p><p>Mrs. Bates come upstairs. </p><p> "Who’s got that raddio?” her queru-</p><p>lous voice preceded her. "I hear it hum- </p><p>min’! Get it right out of here if you </p><p>don’t wanta pay me extry for the ’lectric- </p><p>ity it’s burninV’ </p><p> "Oh, ye gods!” Kennicott groaned</p><p>frantically. "Stall her! Don’t let that </p><p>gabby old fool find out about this—it’ll </p><p>ruin everything! Help me, and I’ll tell </p><p>you the whole story.” </p><p> He darted past me without waiting for</p><p>my answer and slammed the door after </p><p>him. The droning noise subsided and </p><p>then was swiftly muffled so that it was </p><p>no longer audible. </p><p> Mrs. Bates puffed up the stairs and</p><p>eyed me accusingly. "So it’s you that’s </p><p>got that raddio? I told you the day you </p><p>come-” </p><p> "All right,” I said, pretending annoy-</p><p>ance. "I’ve turned it off, and anyhow it </p><p>goes out tomorrow. I was just keeping it </p><p>for a friend.” </p><p> "Eh? Well-” She eyed me sourly,</p><p>then sniffed and went on back down- </p><p>stairs, muttering under her breath. </p><p> I strode to Kennicott’s door and rapped</p><p>softly. A key grated in the lo'ck and I was </p><p>admitted by my wild-eyed neighbor. On </p><p>the bed, muffled by pillows, lay the black </p><p>box humming softly on a shrill note. </p><p> "I n—n n—ng—ng!” it went, exactly</p><p>like a radio tuned to a station that is </p><p>temporarily off the air. </p><p> Curiosity was gnawing at my vitals.</p><p>Impatiently I watched Kennicott striding </p><p>up and down the little attic room, strik- </p><p>ing one fist against the other palm. </p><p> "Well?” I demanded.</p><p> And with obvious reluctance, in a voice</p><p>jerky with excitement, he began to unfold </p><p>the secret of the thing inside that onyx- </p><p>like box. I sat on the bed beside it, my </p><p>eyes riveted on Kennicott’s face, spell- </p><p>bound by what he was saying. </p><p>UR plane,” he began, "was demol- </p><p>ished. We made a forced landing </p><p>in the center of a dense jungle. If you </p><p>know Brazil at all, you’ll know what it </p><p>was like. Trees, trees, trees! Crawling </p><p>insects as big as your fist. A hot sicken- </p><p>ing smell of rotting vegetation, and now </p><p>and then the screech of some animal or </p><p>bird eery enough to make your hair stand </p><p>on end. We cracked up right in the mid- </p><p>dle of nowhere. </p><p> "I crawled out of the wreckage with</p><p>only a sprained wrist and a few minor </p><p>cuts, but McCrea—my co-pilot, you </p><p>know—got a broken leg and a couple of </p><p>bashed ribs. He was in a bad way, poor </p><p>devil! Fat little guy, bald, scared of </p><p>women, and always cracking wise about </p><p>something. A swell sport.” </p><p> The aviator’s face convulsed briefly,</p><p>and he stared at the box on the bed be- </p><p>680 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>side me with a peculiar expression of </p><p>loathing. </p><p> "McCrea Y dead, then?” I prompted.</p><p> Kennicott nodded his head dully, and</p><p>shrugged. "God only knows! I guess </p><p>you’d call it death. But let me get on </p><p>with it. </p><p> "We slashed and sweated our way</p><p>through an almost impenetrable wall of </p><p>undergrowth for two days, carrying what </p><p>food and cigarets we had in that make- </p><p>shift box there.” </p><p> A thumb-jerk indicated the square</p><p>black thing beside me, droning softly </p><p>without a break on the same high note. </p><p> "McCrea was running a fever, though,</p><p>so we made camp and I struck out to find </p><p>water. When I came back-” </p><p> Kennicott choked. I stared at him,</p><p>waiting until his hoarse voice went on </p><p>doggedly: </p><p> "When I came back, McCrea was gone.</p><p>I called and called. No answer. Then, </p><p>thinking he might have wandered away </p><p>delirious, I picked out his trail and fol- </p><p>lowed it into the jungle. It wasn’t hard </p><p>to do, because he had to break a path </p><p>through that wall of undergrowth, and </p><p>now and then I’d find blood on a bram- </p><p>ble or maybe a scrap of torn cloth from </p><p>his khaki shirt. </p><p> "Not more than a hundred yards south</p><p>of our camp I suddenly became aware of </p><p>a queer humming sound in my ears. Posi- </p><p>tive that this had drawn McCrea, I fol- </p><p>lowed it. It got louder and louder, like </p><p>the drone of a powerful dynamo. It </p><p>seemed to fill the air and set all the trees </p><p>to quivering. My teeth were on edge </p><p>with the monotony of it, but I kept on, </p><p>and unexpectedly found myself walking </p><p>into a patch of jungle that was all black! </p><p>Not burnt in a forest fire, as I first </p><p>thought, but dead-black in every detail. </p><p>Not a spot of color anywhere; and in that </p><p>jungle with all its vivid foliage, the effect </p><p>really slapped you in the face! It was as</p><p>though somebody had turned out the </p><p>lights and yet you could still distinguish </p><p>the formation of every object around you. </p><p>It was uncanny! </p><p> "There was black sand on the ground</p><p>as far as I could see. Not soft jungle- </p><p>soil, damp and fertile. This stuff was as </p><p>hard and dry as emery, and it glittered </p><p>like soft coal. All the trees were black </p><p>and shiny like anthracite, and not a leaf </p><p>stirred anywhere, not an insect crawled. I </p><p>almost fainted as I realized why. </p><p> "It was a petrified forest!</p><p> "Those trees, leaves and all, had turned</p><p>into a shiny black kind of stone that </p><p>looked like coal but was mudi harder. It </p><p>wouldn’t chip when I struck it with a </p><p>fallen limb of the same stuff. It wouldn’t </p><p>bend; I simply had to squeeze through </p><p>holes in underbrush more rigid than cast </p><p>iron. And all black, mind you—a jungle </p><p>of fuliginous rock like something out of </p><p>Dante’s Inferno. </p><p> "Once I stumbled over an object and</p><p>stopped to pick it up. It was McCrea’s </p><p>canteen—the only thing in sight, besides </p><p>myself, that was not made of that queer </p><p>black stone. He had come this way, then. </p><p>Relieved, I started shouting his name </p><p>again, but the sound of my voice fright- </p><p>ened me. The silence of that place fairly </p><p>pressed against my eardrums, broken only </p><p>by that steady droning sound. But, you </p><p>see, I’d become so used to it, like the </p><p>constant ticking of a clock, that I hardly </p><p>heard it. </p><p> "Panic swept over me all at once, an</p><p>unreasonable fear, as the sound of my </p><p>own voice banged against the trees and </p><p>came back in a thousand echoes, borne on </p><p>that humming sound that never changed </p><p>its tone. I don’t know why; maybe it was </p><p>the grinding monotony of it and the un- </p><p>relieved black of that stone forest. But </p><p>my nerve snapped and I bolted back </p><p>along the way I had come, sobbing like </p><p>a kid. </p><p>THE BLACK STONE STATUE </p><p>681 </p><p> "I must have run in a circle, though,</p><p>tripping and cutting myself on that rock- </p><p>underbrush. In my terror I forgot the </p><p>direction of our camp. I was lost— </p><p>abruptly I realized it—lost in that hell of </p><p>coal-black stone, without food or any </p><p>chance of getting it, with McCrea’s </p><p>empty canteen in my hand and no idea </p><p>where he had wandered in his fever. </p><p> "For hours I plunged on, forgetting to</p><p>back-track, and cursing aloud because Mc- </p><p>Crea wouldn’t answer me. That hum- </p><p>ming noise had got on my nerves now, </p><p>droning on that one shrill note until I </p><p>thought I would go mad. Exhausted, I </p><p>sank down on that emery-sand, croudied </p><p>against the trunk of a black stone tree. </p><p>McCrea had deserted me, I thought </p><p>crazily. Someone had rescued him and </p><p>he had left me here to die—which </p><p>should give you an idea of my state of </p><p>mind. </p><p> "I huddled there, letting my eyes rove</p><p>in a sort of helpless stupor. On the sand </p><p>beside me was a tiny rock that resembled </p><p>a butterfly delicately carved out of onyx. </p><p>I picked it up dazedly, staring at its hard </p><p>little legs and feelers like wire that </p><p>would neither bend nor break off. And </p><p>then my gaze started wandering again. </p><p> "It fastened on something a few dozen</p><p>paces to my right—and I was sure then </p><p>that I had gone mad. At first it seemed </p><p>to be a stump of that same dark mineral. </p><p>But it wasn’t a stump. I crawled over to </p><p>it and sat there, gaping at it with my </p><p>senses reeling, while that humming noise </p><p>rang louder and louder in my ears. </p><p> "It was a black stone statue of Mc-</p><p>Crea, perfect in every detail! </p><p> "He was depicted stooping over, with</p><p>one hand holding out his automatic </p><p>gripped by the barrel. His stocky figure, </p><p>aviator’s helmet, his makeshift crutch, </p><p>and even the splints on his broken leg </p><p>were shiny black stone. And his face, to </p><p>the last hair of his eyelashes, was a per- </p><p>fect mask of black rock set in an expres- </p><p>sion of puzzled curiosity.</p><p>“T GOT to my feet and walked around </p><p>-B. the figure, then gave it a push. It </p><p>toppled over, just like a statue, and the </p><p>sound of its fall was deafening in that </p><p>silent forest. Hefting it, I was amazed </p><p>to find that it weighed less than twenty </p><p>pounds. I hacked at it with a file we had </p><p>brought from the plane in lieu of a </p><p>machete, but only succeeded in snapping </p><p>the tool in half. Not a chip flew off the </p><p>statue. Not a dent appeared in its pol- </p><p>ished surface. </p><p> "The thing was so unspeakably weird</p><p>that I did not even try to explain it to </p><p>myself, but started calling McCrea again. </p><p>If it was a gag of some kind, he could </p><p>explain it. But there was no answer to </p><p>my shouts other than the monotonous </p><p>hum of that unseen dynamo. </p><p> "Instead of frightening me more, this</p><p>weird discovery seemed to jerk me up </p><p>short. Collecting my scattered wits, I </p><p>started back-trailing myself to the camp, </p><p>thinking McCrea might have returned in </p><p>my absence. The droning noise was so </p><p>loud now, it pained my eardrums unless </p><p>I kept my hands over my ears. This I </p><p>did, stumbling along with my eyes glued </p><p>to my own footprints in the hard dry </p><p>sand. </p><p> "And suddenly I brought up short.</p><p>Directly ahead of me, under a black stone </p><p>bush, lay something that made me gape </p><p>with my mouth ajar. </p><p> "I can’t describe it—no one could. It</p><p>resembled nothing so much as a star- </p><p>shaped blob of transparent jelly that </p><p>shimmered and changed color like an </p><p>opal. It appeared to be some lower form </p><p>of animal, one-celled, not large, only </p><p>about a foot in circumference when it </p><p>stretched those feelers out to full length. </p><p>It oozed along over the sand like a snail, </p><p>682 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>groping its way with those star-points— </p><p>and it hummed! </p><p> "The droning noise ringing in my ears</p><p>issued from this nightmare creature! </p><p> "It was nauseating to watch, and yet</p><p>beautiful, too, with all those iridescent </p><p>colors gleaming against that setting of </p><p>dead-black stone. I approached within a </p><p>pace of it, started to nudge it with my </p><p>foot, but couldn’t quite bring myself to </p><p>touch the squashy thing. And I’ve </p><p>thanked my stars ever since for being so </p><p>squeamish! </p><p> "Instead, I took off my flying-helmet</p><p>and tossed the goggles directly in the </p><p>path of the creature. It did not pause or </p><p>turn aside, but merely reached out one </p><p>of those sickening feelers and brushed </p><p>the goggles very lightly. </p><p> "And they turned to stone!</p><p> "Just that! God be my witness that</p><p>those leather and glass goggles grew </p><p>black before my starting eyes. In less </p><p>than a minute they were petrified into </p><p>hard fuliginous rock like everything else </p><p>around me. </p><p> "In one hideous moment I realized the</p><p>meaning of that weirdly life-like statue </p><p>of McCrea. I knew what he had done. </p><p>He had prodded this jelly-like Thing </p><p>with his automatic, and it had turned </p><p>(him—and everything in contact with him </p><p>*—into shiny dark stone. </p><p> "Nausea overcame me. I wanted to</p><p>run, to escape the sight of that oozing </p><p>horror, but reason came to my rescue. I </p><p>reminded myself that I was Paul Kenni- </p><p>cott, intrepid explorer. Through a hor- </p><p>rible experience McCrea and I had stum- </p><p>bled upon something in the Brazilian </p><p>wilds which would revolutionize the civ- </p><p>ilized world. McCrea was dead, or in </p><p>some ghastly suspended form of life, </p><p>through his efforts to solve the mystery. </p><p>I owed it to him and to myself not to </p><p>lose my head now. </p><p> "For the practical possibilities of the</p><p>Thing struck me like a blow. That black </p><p>stone the creature’s touch created from </p><p>any earth-substance—by rays from its </p><p>body, by a secretion of its glands, by God </p><p>knows what strange metamorphosis—was </p><p>indestructible! Bridges, houses, build- </p><p>ings, roads, could be built of ordinary </p><p>material and then petrified by the touch </p><p>of this jelly-like Thing which had surely </p><p>tumbled from some planet with life- </p><p>forces diametrically opposed to our own. </p><p> "Millions of dollars squandered on</p><p>construction each year could be diverted </p><p>to other phases of life, for no cyclone or </p><p>flood could damage a city built of this </p><p>hard black rock. </p><p> "I said a little prayer for my martyred</p><p>co-pilot, and then and there resolved to </p><p>take the creature back to civilization </p><p>with me. </p><p> "It could be trapped, I was sure—</p><p>though the prospect appealed to me far </p><p>less than that of caging a hungry leopard! </p><p>I did not venture to try it until I had </p><p>studied the problem from every angle, </p><p>however, and made certain deductions </p><p>through experiment. </p><p> "I found that any substance already</p><p>petrified was insulated against the thing’s </p><p>power. I tossed my belt on it, saw it </p><p>freeze into black rock, then put my </p><p>wrist-watch in contact with the rock belt. </p><p>My watch remained as it was. Another </p><p>phenomenon I discovered was that petri- </p><p>faction also occurred in things in direct </p><p>contact with something the creature </p><p>touched, if that something was not al- </p><p>ready petrified, </p><p> "Dropping my glove fastened to my</p><p>signet ring, I let the creature touch only </p><p>the glove. But both objects were petri- </p><p>fied. I tried it again with a chain of </p><p>three objects, and discovered that the </p><p>touched object and the one in contact </p><p>with it turned into black rock, while the </p><p>third on the chain remained unaffected. </p><p>THE BLACK STONE STATUE </p><p>683 </p><p>“Tt took me about three days to trap </p><p>•*- the thing, although it gave no more </p><p>actual resistance, of course, than a large </p><p>snail. McCrea, poor devil, had blun- </p><p>dered into the business; but I went at it </p><p>in a scientific manner, knowing what </p><p>danger I faced from the creature. I </p><p>found my way again to our camp and </p><p>brought back our provision box—yes, the </p><p>one there on the bed beside you. When </p><p>the thing’s touch had turned it into a </p><p>perfect stone cage for itself, I scooped it </p><p>inside with petrified brandies. But, </p><p>Lord! How the sweat stood out on my </p><p>face at the prospect of a slip that might </p><p>make me touch the horrible little organ- </p><p>ism! </p><p> "The trip out of that jungle was a</p><p>nightmare. I spent almost all I had, hir- </p><p>ing scared natives to guide me a mile or </p><p>so before they’d bolt with terror of my </p><p>humming box. On board a tramp steam- </p><p>er bound for the States, I nearly lost my </p><p>captive. The first mate thought it was an </p><p>infernal machine and tried to throw it </p><p>overboard. My last cent went to shut </p><p>him up; so I landed in New York flat </p><p>broke.” </p><p> Paul Kennicott laughed and spread</p><p>his hands. "But here I am. I don’t dare </p><p>go to anyone I know just yet. Reporters </p><p>will run me ragged, and I want plenty of </p><p>time to make the right contacts. Do you </p><p>realize what’s in that box?” He grinned </p><p>with boyish delight. "Fame and for- </p><p>tune, that’s what! McCrea’s family will </p><p>never know want again. Science will re- </p><p>member our names along with Edison </p><p>and Bell and all the rest. We’ve dis- </p><p>covered a new force that will rock the </p><p>world with its possibilities. That’s why,” </p><p>he explained, "I’ve sneaked into the </p><p>country like an alien. If the wrong peo- </p><p>ple heard of this first, my life wouldn’t </p><p>be worth a dime, understand? There are </p><p>millions involved in this thing. Billions! </p><p>Don’t you see?” </p><p> He stopped, eyeing me anxiously. I</p><p>stared at him and rose slowly from the </p><p>bed. Thoughts were seething in my </p><p>mind—dark ugly thoughts, ebbing and </p><p>flowing to the sound of that "i—n n—</p><p>n n g—n n g!” that filled the shabby </p><p>room. </p><p> For, I did see the possibilities of that</p><p>jelly-like thing’s power to turn any ob- </p><p>ject into black stone. But I was thinking </p><p>as a sculptor. What do I care for roads </p><p>or buildings? Sculpture is my whole life! </p><p>To my mind’s eye rose the picture of co- </p><p>pilot McCrea as Kennicott had described </p><p>him—a figure, perfect to the last detail, </p><p>done in black stone. </p><p> Kennicott was still eyeing me anxious-</p><p>ly—perhaps reading the ugly thoughts </p><p>that flitted like shadows behind my eyes. </p><p> "You’ll keep mum?” he begged. "Do</p><p>that for me, old boy, and I’ll set you up </p><p>in a studio beyond your wildest dreams. </p><p>I’ll build up your fame as—what are </p><p>you?” </p><p> His gray eyes fastened on my dirty</p><p>smock. </p><p> "Some kind of an artist? I’ll show you</p><p>how much I appreciate your help. Are </p><p>you with me?” </p><p> Some kind of an artist! Perhaps if he</p><p>had not said that, flaying my crushed </p><p>pride and ambition to the quick, I would </p><p>never have done the awful thing I did. </p><p>But black jealousy rose in my soul— </p><p>jealousy of this eager young man who </p><p>could walk out into the streets now with </p><p>his achievement and make the world bow </p><p>at his feet, while I in my own field was </p><p>no more to the public than what he had </p><p>called me: "some kind of an artist.” At </p><p>that moment I knew precisely what I </p><p>wanted to do. </p><p> I did not meet his frank gray eyes. In-</p><p>stead, I pinned my gaze on that droning </p><p>black box as my voice rasped harshly: </p><p> "No! Do you really imagine that I</p><p>believe this idiotic story of yours? You’re </p><p>684 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> insane! I'm going to call the police—</p><p>they’ll find out what really happened to </p><p>McCrea out there in the jungle! There’s </p><p>nothing in that box. It’s just a trick.” </p><p> Kennicott’s mouth fell open, then</p><p>closed in an angry line. The next mo* </p><p>ment he shrugged and laughed. </p><p> "Of course you don’t believe me,” he</p><p>nodded. "Who could?—unless they had </p><p>seen what I’ve seen with my own eyes. </p><p>Here,” he said briskly, "I’ll take this </p><p>book and drop it in the box for you. </p><p>You’ll see the creature, and you’ll see this </p><p>book turned into black stone.” </p><p> I stepped back, heart pounding, eyes</p><p>narrowed. Kennicott leaned over the </p><p>bed, unfastened the box gingerly with a </p><p>wary expression on his face, and mo- </p><p>tioned me to approach. Briefly I glanced </p><p>over his shoulder as he dropped the book </p><p>inside the open box. </p><p> I saw horror—a jelly-like, opalescent</p><p>thing like a five-pointed star. It pulsed </p><p>and quivered for an instant, and the room </p><p>fairly rocked to the unmuffled sound of </p><p>that vibrant humming. </p><p> I also saw the small cloth-bound book</p><p>Kennicott had dropped inside. It lay </p><p>half on top of the squirming creature—a </p><p>book carved out of black stone. </p><p> "There! You see?” Kennicott pointed.</p><p>And those were the last words he ever </p><p>uttered. </p><p> Remembering what he had said about</p><p>the power of the creature being unable </p><p>to penetrate to a third object, I snatched </p><p>at Kennicott’s sleeve-covered arm, gave </p><p>him a violent shove, and saw his muscu- </p><p>lar hand plunge for an instant deep into </p><p>the black box. The sleeve hardened be- </p><p>neath my fingers. </p><p> I cowered back, sickened at what I had</p><p>done. </p><p> Paul Kennicott, his arms thrown out</p><p>and horror stamped on his fine young </p><p>face, had frozen into a statue of black</p><p>shiny stone! </p><p> Then footsteps were clumping up the</p><p>stairs again. I realized that Mrs. Bates </p><p>would surely have heard the violent </p><p>droning that issued from the open box. I </p><p>shut it swiftly, muffled it, and shoved it </p><p>under the bed. </p><p>I was at my own doorway when the </p><p>landlady came puffing up the stairs. </p><p>My face was calm, my voice contained, </p><p>and no one but me could hear the furi- </p><p>ous pounding of my heart. </p><p> "Now, you look a-here!” Mrs. Bates</p><p>burst out. "I told you to turn that raddio </p><p>off. You take it right out of my room </p><p>this minute! Runnin’ up my bill for </p><p>’lectricity!” </p><p> I	apologized meekly and with a great</p><p>show carried out a tool-case of mine, </p><p>saying it was the portable radio I had </p><p>been testing for a friend. It satisfied her </p><p>for the moment, but later, as I was carry- </p><p>ing the black stone figure of Paul Kenni- </p><p>cott to my own room, she caught me at it. </p><p> "Why,” the old snoop exclaimed. "If</p><p>that ain’t the spittin’ image of our new </p><p>roomer! Friend of yours, is he?” </p><p> I	thought swiftly and lied jauntily. "A</p><p>model of mine. I’ve been working on </p><p>this statue at night, the reason you </p><p>haven’t seen him going in and out. I </p><p>thought I would have to rent a room for </p><p>him here, but as the statue is finished </p><p>now, it won’t be necessary after all. You </p><p>may keep the rent money, though,” I </p><p>added. “And get me a taxi to haul my </p><p>masterpiece to the express station. I am </p><p>ready to submit it to the Museum of Fine </p><p>Arts.” </p><p> And that is my story, gentlemen. The</p><p>black stone statue which, ironically, I </p><p>chose to call Fear of the Unknown, is not </p><p>a product of my skill. (Small wonder </p><p>several people have noticed its re- </p><p>semblance to the "lost explorer,” Paul </p><p>Kennicott!) Nor did I do the group of </p><p>THE BLACK STONE STATUE </p><p>685 </p><p>soldiers commissioned by the Anti-War </p><p>Association. None of my so-called </p><p>Symphonies in Black were wrought by </p><p>my hand—but I can tell you what became </p><p>of the models who were unfortunate </p><p>enough to pose for me! </p><p> My real work is perhaps no better</p><p>than that of a rank novice, although up </p><p>to that fatal afternoon I had honestly be- </p><p>lieved myself capable of great work as a </p><p>sculptor some day. </p><p> But I am an impostor. You want a</p><p>statue of me, you say in your cablegram, </p><p>done in the mysterious black stone which </p><p>has made me so famous? Ah, gentle- </p><p>men, you shall have that statue! </p><p> I am writing this confession aboard the</p><p>5*. S. Madrigal, and I shall leave it with a </p><p>steward to be mailed to you at our next </p><p>port of call. </p><p> Tonight I shall take out of my state-</p><p>room the hideous thing in its black box </p><p>which has never left my side. Such a </p><p>creature, contrary to all nature on this </p><p>earth of ours, should be exterminated. </p><p>As soon as darkness falls I shall stand on </p><p>deck and balance the box on the rail so </p><p>that it will fall into the sea after my hand </p><p>has touched what is inside. </p><p> I wonder if the process of being turned</p><p>into that black rock is painful, or if it is </p><p>accompanied only by a feeling of leth- </p><p>argy? And McCrea, Paul Kennicott, and </p><p>those unfortunate models whom I have </p><p>passed off as "my work”—are they dead, </p><p>as we know death, or are their statues </p><p>sentient and possessed of nerves? How </p><p>does that jelly creature feel to the touch? </p><p>Does it impart a violent electrical shock </p><p>or a subtle emanation of some force be- </p><p>yond our ken, changing the atom-struc- </p><p>ture of the flesh it turns into stone? </p><p> Many such questions have occurred to</p><p>me often in the small hours when I lie </p><p>awake, tortured by remorse for what I </p><p>have done. </p><p> But tonight, gentlemen, I shall know</p><p>all the answers. </p><p>Vhe </p><p>O </p><p>Id House on the Hill </p><p>By WINONA MONTGOMERY GILLILAND </p><p>From the wide valley, I looked up and saw </p><p>The house upon the hill, that I had seen </p><p>So many times before. By every law </p><p>It should have seemed, just what it long had been, </p><p>An old house that someone, with loving care, </p><p>Had painted white; at doors and windows hung </p><p>Green-painted shutters. But it had an air </p><p>Of difference, today. The wind had flung, </p><p>Or some hand closed, the shutters on the doors, </p><p>French-doors, with windows over them; the trim </p><p>Between shone white, through pines and sycamores, </p><p>To form two crosses, and my eyes grew dim. </p><p>I thought, "There is no home without its cross </p><p>Hidden about it somewhere; pain—or loss." </p><p> 1 lames of Vengeance</p><p>By SEABURY QUINN </p><p>A strange doom hung over young Pemberton and his wife, a brooding horror </p><p>spawned in India and transplanted to America in all its murderous </p><p>potency—a brilliant exploit of Jules de Grandin </p><p>WITH intently narrowed eyes, </p><p>lips pursed in concentration, </p><p>Jules de Grandin stood envel- </p><p>oped in a gayly flowered apron while he </p><p>measured out the olive oil as an apothe- </p><p>cary might decant a precious drug.

Across the stove </p><p>from him Nora McGinnis, my household </p><p>factotum and the finest cook in northern </p><p>Jersey, gazed at him like a nun breathless </p><p>with adoration. </p><p> "Mon Dieu” he whispered reverently,</p><p>"one little drop too much and he is </p><p>ruined, a single drop too few and he is </p><p>simply spoiled!

His big nose, high cheekbones and </p><p>sandy hair, together with his smartly </p><p>clipped mustache, would have labeled </p><p>him a Briton, even had he lacked the </p><p>careless nonchalance of dress and Oxford </p><p>accent which completed his ensemble. </p><p> "Jolly good of Sergeant Costello to</p><p>give me a chit to you,” he told de Gran- </p><p>din as the little Frenchman came into </p><p>the study and eyed him with cold hatred. </p><p>"I’m sure I don't know where I could </p><p>have looked for help if he’d not thought </p><p>of you.” </p><p> De Grandin’s frigid manner showed</p><p>no sign of thawing. "What can I do </p><p>for you, Monsieur le Capitai?ie—or is it </p><p>lieutenant?” he asked. </p><p> The caller gave a start. "You know</p><p>me?” he demanded. </p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>687 </p><p> "I have never had the pleasure of be-</p><p>holding you before,” the Frenchman an- </p><p>swered. His tone implied he was not </p><p>anxious to prolong the scrutiny. </p><p> "But you knew I was in the service?”</p><p>"Naturally. You are obviously Eng- </p><p>lish and a gentleman. You were at least </p><p>eighteen in 1914. That assures one you </p><p>were in the war. Your complexion shows </p><p>you have resided in the tropics, which </p><p>might mean either India or Africa, but </p><p>you called the sergeant's note a chit, </p><p>which means you’ve spent some time in </p><p>India. Now, if you will kindly state your </p><p>business-” he paused with raised </p><p>eyebrows. </p><p> "It’s a funny, mixed-up sort o’ thing,”</p><p>the other answered. "You’re right in </p><p>saying that I’ve been in India; I was out </p><p>there almost twenty years. Chucked it </p><p>up and went to farmin’; then a cousin </p><p>died here in the province of New Jersey, </p><p>leavin’ me a mass o’ rock and rubble and </p><p>about two hundred thousand pounds, to </p><p>boot.” </p><p> The look of long-enduring patience</p><p>deepened on de Grandin’s features. </p><p>"And what is one to do?” he rejoined </p><p>wearily. "Help you find a buyer for the </p><p>land? You will be going back to Eng- </p><p>land with the cash, of course.” </p><p> The caller’s tanned complexion deep-</p><p>mm </p><p>wSffiiiSiMwS </p><p>‘A line of flame was rising, flicker- </p><p>ing and dancing." </p><p>688 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>ened with a flush, but he ignored the </p><p>studied insult of the question. "No such </p><p>luck. I’d not be takin’ up your time if </p><p>things were simple as that. What I need </p><p>is someone to help me duck the family </p><p>curse until I can comply with the will’s </p><p>terms. He was a queer blighter, this </p><p>American cousin of mine. His great- </p><p>grandfather came out to the provinces— </p><p>the States, I should say—without so </p><p>much as a pot to drink his beer from or </p><p>a window he could toss it out of; cadet </p><p>of the family, and all that, you know. </p><p>He must have prospered, though, for </p><p>when he burned to death he left half the </p><p>bally county to his heirs at law, and pro- </p><p>vided in his will that whoever took the </p><p>estate must live at least twelve months </p><p>in the old mansion house. Sort o’ period </p><p>of probation, you see. No member of </p><p>the family can get a penny of the cash </p><p>till he’s finished out his year of resi- </p><p>dence. I fancy the old duffer got the </p><p>wind up at the last and was bound he’d </p><p>show the heathens that their blighted </p><p>curse was all a lot of silly rot.” </p><p>De grandin’s air of cold hostility </p><p>had been moderating steadily. As </p><p>the caller finished speaking he leant for- </p><p>ward with a smile. "You have spoken of </p><p>a family curse, Monsieur; just what is it, </p><p>if you please?” </p><p> An embarrassed look came in the</p><p>other’s face. "Don’t think that I’m an </p><p>utter ass,” he begged. "I know it sounds </p><p>a bit thick when you put it into words, </p><p>but—well, the thing has seemed to work, </p><p>and I’d rather not take chances. All right </p><p>for me, of course; but there’s Avis and </p><p>the little chap to think of. </p><p> "Old Albert Pemberton, my great-</p><p>grandfather’s brother and the founder of </p><p>the family in America, left two sons, </p><p>John and Albert, junior. They were will- </p><p>ing enough to pass their year of resi- </p><p>dence, but neither of ’em finished it. John </p><p>left two sons, and they died trying to </p><p>live out the year at Foxcroft. So did their </p><p>two sisters, and their husbands. The </p><p>chap I take it from was the younger </p><p>daughter’s son, and not born on the</p><p>property. There’s never been a birth in </p><p>the old manor house, though there have </p><p>been twelve sudden deaths there; for </p><p>every legatee attempting to observe the </p><p>dictates of old Albert’s will has died. Yet </p><p>each generation has passed the estate </p><p>down with the same proviso for a year’s </p><p>residence as condition precedent to in- </p><p>heritance. Seems as if they’re all deter- </p><p>mined to defy the curse-” </p><p> "Mille tourments, this everlasting</p><p>curse; what is this seven times accursed </p><p>curse of which you speak so glibly and </p><p>tell us absolutely nothing?” </p><p> For answer Pemberton readied in his</p><p>jacket and produced a locket. It was </p><p>made of gold, slightly larger than an </p><p>old-time watch, and set with rows of </p><p>seed-pearls round the edge. Snapping it </p><p>open, he disclosed two portraits painted </p><p>with minute detail on ivory plaques. One </p><p>was of a young man in a tightly-buttoned </p><p>jacket of white cloth, high-collared, gilt- </p><p>braided, with insignia of some military </p><p>rank upon the shoulders. Upon his head </p><p>he wore a military cap shaped something </p><p>like the kepi which the French wore in </p><p>Algeria about the middle of the Nine- </p><p>teenth Century, hooded in a linen sheath </p><p>which terminated in a neck-doth trailing </p><p>down between his shoulders. Despite the </p><p>mustache and long sideburns the face </p><p>was youthful; the man could not have </p><p>been much more than three and twenty. </p><p> "That’s Albert Pemberton,” our visitor</p><p>announced. "And that’s his wife Maria, </p><p>or, as she was originally known, Saras- </p><p>tai.” </p><p> "Par bleu!”</p><p> "Quite so. Lovely, wasn’t she?”</p><p> She was, indeed. Her hair, so black</p><p>it seemed to have the blue lights of a </p><p> W. T.—3</p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>689 </p><p>cockerel's ruff within its depths, was </p><p>smoothly parted in the middle and </p><p>brought down each side her face across </p><p>the small and low-set ears, framing an </p><p>oleander-white forehead. Her wide- </p><p>spaced, large, dark eyes and her full- </p><p>lipped mouth were exquisite. Her nose </p><p>was small and straight, with fine-cut </p><p>nostrils; her chin, inclined to pointed- </p><p>ness, was cleft across the middle by a </p><p>dimple. Brows of almost startling black </p><p>curved in circumflexes over her fine eyes </p><p>in the "flying gull” formation so much </p><p>prized by beauty connoisseurs of the </p><p>early eighteen hundreds. Pearl-set pend- </p><p>ants dangled from her ear-lobes nearly </p><p>to the creamy shoulders which her low- </p><p>necked gown exposed. One hand was </p><p>laid upon her bosom, and the fingers </p><p>were so fine and tapering that they </p><p>seemed almost transparent, and were </p><p>tipped by narrow, pointed nails almost as </p><p>red as strawberries. She was younger </p><p>than her husband by some three or four </p><p>years, and her youthful look was height- </p><p>ened by the half-afraid, half-pleading </p><p>glance that lay in her dark eyes. </p><p> "Que e’est belle; que e'est jeune!” de</p><p>Grandin breathed. "And it was through </p><p>her-” </p><p> Our caller started forward in his chair.</p><p>"Yes! How’d you guess it?” </p><p> I looked at them in wonder. That</p><p>they understood each other perfectly was </p><p>obvious, but what it was they were agreed </p><p>on I could not imagine. </p><p> De Grandin chuckled as he noticed</p><p>my bewilderment. "Tell him, mon ami,” </p><p>he bade the Englishman. "He cannot </p><p>understand how one so lovely—morbleu, </p><p>my friend,” he turned to me, "I bet my- </p><p>self five francs you do not more than </p><p>half suspect the lady’s nationality!” </p><p> "Of course I do,” I answered short-</p><p>ly. "She’s English. Anyone can see </p><p>that much. She was Mrs. Pemberton, </p><p>and-” </p><p> W. T.—4</p><p> "Non, non,” he answered with a</p><p>laugh, "that is the beauty of the tropics </p><p>which we see upon her face. She was— </p><p>correct me if I err, Monsieur”—he </p><p>bowed to Pemberton—"she was an </p><p>Indian lady, and, unless I miss my guess, </p><p>a high-caste Hindoo, one of those in </p><p>whom the blood of Alexander’s conquer- </p><p>ing Greeks ran almost undefiled. N’est- </p><p>ce-pas?” </p><p> "Correct!” our visitor agreed. "My</p><p>great-great-uncle met her just before the </p><p>Mutiny, in 1856. It was through her that </p><p>he came here, and through her that the </p><p>curse began, according to the family </p><p>legend.” </p><p> Lights were playing in de Grandin’s</p><p>eyes, little flashes like heat-lightning </p><p>flickering in a summer sky, as he bent </p><p>and tapped our caller on the knee with an </p><p>imperative forefinger. "At the begin- </p><p>ning, if you please, Monsieur,” he bade. </p><p>"Start at the beginning and relate the </p><p>tale. It may help to guide us when we </p><p>come to formulate our strategy. This </p><p>Monsieur Albert Pemberton met his lady </p><p>while he served with the East India Com- </p><p>pany in the days before the Sepoy </p><p>Mutiny. How was it that he met her, </p><p>and where did it occur?” </p><p>Pemberton smiled quizzically as he </p><p>lighted the cigar the Frenchman prof- </p><p>fered. "I have it from his journal,” he </p><p>replied. "They were great diarists, those </p><p>old boys, and my uncle rated a double </p><p>first when it came to setting down the </p><p>happenings of the day with photographic </p><p>detail. In the fall of ’56 he was scout- </p><p>ing up Bithoor way with a detail of </p><p>North Country sowars—mounted troops, </p><p>you know—henna-bearded, swaggering </p><p>followers of the Prophet who would </p><p>cheerfully have slit every Hindoo throat </p><p>between the Himalayas and the Bay of </p><p>Bengal. They made temporary camp for </p><p>tiffin in a patch of wooded land, and the </p><p>690 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>fires had just been lighted underneath the </p><p>troopers’ cook-pots when there came a </p><p>sort of ominous murmur from the road- </p><p>way which wound past the woodland </p><p>toward the river and the burning-ghats </p><p>beyond. Little flickers of the flame that </p><p>was about to burst into a holocaust next </p><p>year were already beginning to show, and </p><p>my uncle thought it best to take no </p><p>chances; so he sent a file of troopers with </p><p>a subadar to see what it was all about. In </p><p>ten or fifteen minutes they came back, </p><p>swearing such oaths as only Afghan </p><p>Mussulmans can use when speaking of </p><p>despised Hindoos. </p><p> fr 'Wah, it is a burning, Captain Sahib,’</p><p>the subadar reported. The Infidels—may </p><p>Allah make their faces black! — drag </p><p>forth a widow to be burnt upon her hus- </p><p>band’s funeral pyre.’ </p><p> "Now the British Raj forbade suttee</p><p>in 1829, and made those taking any part </p><p>in it accessories to murder. Technically, </p><p>therefore, my uncle’s duty was to stop </p><p>the show, but he had but twenty sowars </p><p>in his detail, and the Hindoos probably </p><p>would number hundreds. He was, as you </p><p>Americans say, in a decided spot. If he </p><p>interfered with the religious rite, even </p><p>though the law forbade it, he’d have a </p><p>first-class riot on his hands, and probably </p><p>lose half of his command, if the whole </p><p>detail weren’t massacred. Besides, his </p><p>orders were to scout and bring reports in </p><p>to the Residency, and he’d not be able </p><p>to perform his mission if he lost too </p><p>many men, or was killed in putting down </p><p>a riot. On the other hand, here was a </p><p>crime in process of commission under his </p><p>immediate observation, and his duty was </p><p>to stop it, so-” </p><p> "Morbleu, one understands!” de Gran-</p><p>din chuckled. "He was, as one might </p><p>say, between the devil and the ocean. </p><p>What did he do, this amiable ancestor </p><p>of yours, Monsieur? One moment, if you </p><p>please-” he raised his hand to shut </p><p>off Pemberton’s reply. "I make the </p><p>wager with myself. I bet me twenty </p><p>francs I know the answer to his conduct</p><p>ere you tell it. Bon, the wager is re- </p><p>corded. Now, if you please, proceed.” </p><p> A boyish grin was on the Briton’s face</p><p>as he replied: "It was a tight fix to be in, </p><p>but I think the old boy used his head, </p><p>at that. First of all, he bundled his dis- </p><p>patches in a packet and told a sowar off </p><p>to take them to the Residency. It was no </p><p>child’s-play to select a messenger, for </p><p>every man in his command itched to sink </p><p>a saber-blade in Hindoo flesh; so finally </p><p>they compromised by drawing lots. </p><p>They’re a bunch of fatalistic johnnies, </p><p>those Mohammedans, and the chap who </p><p>drew the short straw said it was the will </p><p>of Allah that he be denied the pleasure </p><p>of engaging in the shindy, and rode away </p><p>without another murmur. Then my uncle </p><p>told the men to stand to arms while he </p><p>left them with the subadar and took two </p><p>others to go scouting with him. </p><p> "At the forest edge they saw the</p><p>Hindoos coming, and it must have been </p><p>a sight, according to his diary. They </p><p>were raising merry hell with drums and </p><p>cymbals and tom-toms, singing and wail- </p><p>ing and shrieking as if their luncheon </p><p>disagreed with them. In the van came </p><p>Brahmin priests, all decked out in robes </p><p>of state and marching like a squad of </p><p>sergeants major on parade. Then came a </p><p>crowd of gurus—they’re holy men, you </p><p>know, and my uncle knew at once that </p><p>these were specially holy; for whereas </p><p>the average fakir shows enough bare hide </p><p>to let you guess at his complexion, these </p><p>fellows were so smeared with filth and </p><p>ashes that you couldn’t tell if they were </p><p>black or white, and you could smell ’em </p><p>half a mile away if you happened to get </p><p>down-wind of ’em. They were jumpin’ </p><p>and contortin’ round a four-wheeled cart </p><p>to which a span of bullocks had been </p><p>harnessed, and in which stood a ten-foot </p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>691 </p><p>image of the goddess Kali, who’s sup- </p><p>posed to manifest the principles of love </p><p>and death. If you’ve ever seen those </p><p>idols you know what this one looked like </p><p>—black as sin and smeared with goat’s </p><p>blood, four arms branchin’ from its </p><p>shoulders, tongue hangin’ out and all a- </p><p>wash with betel-juice and henna. There’s </p><p>a collar o’ skulls strung round its neck </p><p>and a belt of human hands tied round its </p><p>waist. Not an appetizin’ sight at any </p><p>time, when it’s plastered thick with half- </p><p>dried blood and rancid butter it’s enough </p><p>to make a feller gag. </p><p> "Followin' the Kali-cart was another</p><p>crowd o’ Brahmins, all dressed up for a </p><p>part}', and in their midst they dragged— </p><p>for she could scarcely walk—a girl as </p><p>white as you or I.” </p><p> "A white woman, you say?” I inter-</p><p>rupted. </p><p> "You ought to know, you've just</p><p>looked at her picture,” answered Pem- </p><p>berton, raising the locket from his knee </p><p>and holding out the sweet, pale face </p><p>for my inspection. "That was my Aunt </p><p>Maria—or Sarastai, as she was then. </p><p> "I suppose she must have looked a</p><p>little different in her native dress, but I’ll </p><p>wager she was no less beautiful. My </p><p>uncle’s diary records that she was fairly </p><p>loaded down with jewels. Everywhere a </p><p>gem could find a resting-place had been </p><p>devoted to her decoration. There was </p><p>a diadem of pearls and rubies on her </p><p>head; a 'golden flower,’ or fan-like orna- </p><p>ment of filigree in which small emeralds </p><p>and seed-pearls were set, had been hung </p><p>in her nose, and dropped so low across </p><p>her lips that he could hardly see her </p><p>mouth. Her ears and neck and shoulders </p><p>and arms and wrists and ankles and every </p><p>toe and finger bore some sort of jewel, </p><p>and her gold-embroidered sari was sewn </p><p>about the border with more gems, and </p><p>even her white-muslin veil was edged </p><p>with seed-pearls. </p><p> "Two Brahmins held her elbows, half</p><p>leading and half dragging her along, and </p><p>her head swayed drunkenly, now forward</p><p>on her breast, now falling to one shoul- </p><p>der or the other as she lurched and stag- </p><p>gered on the road. </p><p> "Last of all there marched a company</p><p>of men with simitars and pistols and a </p><p>few long-barreled muskets. In their midst </p><p>they bore a bier on which a corpse lay in </p><p>full-dress regalia, pearl-embroidered tur- </p><p>ban, robe of woven silk and gold, waist- </p><p>shawl set with diamonds. From the rich- </p><p>ness of the widow’s jewels and the mag- </p><p>nificent accouterments the corpse dis- </p><p>played, as well as by the size of the es- </p><p>cort, my uncle knew the dead man was of </p><p>great importance in the neighborhood; </p><p>certainly a wealthy landlord, probably an </p><p>influential nobleman or even petty </p><p>prince.” </p><p>“13 OOR child!” I murmured. "No won- </p><p>A der she was frightened to the point </p><p>of fainting. To be burned alive-” </p><p> "It wasn’t terror, sir,” said Pemberton.</p><p>"You see, to be sati, that is, to offer one- </p><p>self as a voluntary sacrifice upon the fun- </p><p>eral pyre, was considered not only the </p><p>most pious act a widow could perform, </p><p>it enhanced her husband’s standing in the </p><p>future world. Indian women of that day </p><p>—and even nowadays—had that drilled </p><p>into them from infancy, but sometimes </p><p>the flesh is weaker than the spirit. In </p><p>Sarastai’s case her husband was an old </p><p>man, so old that she had never been his </p><p>wife in anything but name, and when </p><p>he died she flinched at the decree that </p><p>she must burn herself upon his funeral </p><p>pyre. To have a widow backslide, es- </p><p>pecially the widow of such an influential </p><p>man as he had been, would have cast dis- </p><p>honor on the family and brought undy- </p><p>ing scandal to the neighborhood; so they </p><p>filled her up with opium and gunjah, put </p><p>her best clothes on her and marched her </p><p>692 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>to the burning-ghat half conscious and all </p><p>but paralyzed with drugs-” </p><p> “Ah, yes, one comprehends complete-</p><p>ly,” broke in Jules de Grandin. "But </p><p>your uncle, what of him? What did he </p><p>then do?" </p><p> "You can’t use cavalry in wooded ter-</p><p>rain, and the forest came down thick </p><p>each side the road. Besides, my uncle </p><p>had but two men with him, and to at- </p><p>tempt a sortie would have meant sure </p><p>death. Accordingly he waited till the </p><p>procession filed past, then hurried back </p><p>to his command and led them toward the </p><p>burning-ghat. This lay in a depression </p><p>by the river bank, so that the partly </p><p>burned corpses could be conveniently </p><p>thrown into the stream when cremation </p><p>rites were finished. The Hindoos had a </p><p>quarter-hour start, but that was just as </p><p>well, as they took more time than that </p><p>to make their preparations. The funeral </p><p>pyre had been erected, and over it they </p><p>poured a quantity of sandal-oil and </p><p>melted butter. Paraffin was not so com- </p><p>mon in the Orient those days. </p><p> "When all had been prepared they</p><p>took the dead man’s costly garments off </p><p>and stripped the widow of her jewels and </p><p>gorgeous sari, wrapping each of them in </p><p>plain white cotton cloth like winding- </p><p>sheets and pouring rancid butter over </p><p>them. They laid the corpse upon the </p><p>pyre and marched the widow seven times </p><p>around it with a lighted torch held in her </p><p>hand. Then they lifted her up to the </p><p>pyre, for the poor kid still was only semi- </p><p>conscious, made her squat cross-legged, </p><p>and laid the dead man’s head upon her </p><p>knees. A Brahmin gave the signal and </p><p>the dead man’s eldest son ran forward </p><p>with a torch to set the oil-soaked wood </p><p>afire, when my uncle rode out from the </p><p>woods and ordered them to halt. He </p><p>spoke Hindustani fluently, and there was </p><p>no mistaking what he said when he told </p><p>them that the Raj had banned suttee and </p><p>commanded them to take the widow </p><p>down. </p><p> "The thing the blighters didn’t know</p><p>was that nineteen Afghan cavalrymen </p><p>were waiting in the underbrush, praying </p><p>as hard as pious men could pray that the </p><p>Hindoos would refuse to heed my uncle’s </p><p>orders. </p><p> "Allah heard their prayers, for the</p><p>only answer that the Brahmins gave was </p><p>a chorus of shrill curses and a barrage </p><p>of stones and cow-dung. The dead man’s </p><p>son ran forward to complete the rite, but </p><p>before he could apply the torch my uncle </p><p>drew his pistol and shot him very neatly </p><p>through the head. </p><p> "Then all hell broke loose. The guard</p><p>of honor brought their muskets into play </p><p>and fired a volley, wounding several of </p><p>the crowd and cutting branches from the </p><p>trees behind my uncle. But when they </p><p>drew their swords and rushed at him it </p><p>was no laughing-matter, for there must </p><p>have been two hundred of them, and </p><p>those fellows are mean hands with the </p><p>bare steel. </p><p> " 'Troop advance! Draw sabers! Trot,</p><p>gallop, charge!’ When the natives heard </p><p>my uncle’s order they halted momentar- </p><p>ily, and it would have been a lot more </p><p>healthy if they’d turned and run, for be- </p><p>fore they could say 'knife’ the Afghans </p><p>were among ’em, and the fat was in the </p><p>fire. </p><p> " 'Yah Allah, Allah—Allah!” cried</p><p>the subadar, and his men gave tongue to </p><p>the pack-cry that men of the North Coun- </p><p>try have used when hunting lowland </p><p>Hindoos since the days when Moslem </p><p>missionaries first converted Afghanistan. </p><p> "There were only nineteen of them,</p><p>and my uncle, while the Hindoos must </p><p>have totaled half a thousand, but”—the </p><p>pride an honest man takes in his trade </p><p>shone in his eyes as Pemberton grinned </p><p>at us—"you don’t need more than twenty </p><p>professional soldiers to scatter a mob of </p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>693 </p><p>scum like that any more than you need </p><p>even numbers when you set the beagles </p><p>on a flock of rabbits!” </p><p> "A merveille!” de Grandin cried. "I</p><p>knew that I should win my bet. Before </p><p>you told us of your uncle’s actions you </p><p>recall I made a wager with myself? Bien. </p><p>I bet me that he would not let that lot </p><p>of monkey-faces commit murder. 1 'res </p><p>bon. Jules de Grandin, pay me what you </p><p>owe!” Solemnly he extracted a dollar </p><p>from his trouser pocket, passed it from </p><p>his right hand to his left, and stowed it </p><p>in his waistcoat. "And now—the curse?” </p><p>he prompted. </p><p> "Quite so, the curse. They took Sarastai</p><p>from the funeral pyre and carried her to </p><p>safety at the station, but before they went </p><p>a guru put a curse on all of them. None </p><p>should die in bed, he swore. Moreover, </p><p>none of them should ever take inher' </p><p>itance of land or goods till kinsman had </p><p>shed kinsman’s blood upon the land to be </p><p>inherited. </p><p> "And the maledictions seemed to</p><p>work,” he ended gloomily. "My Uncle </p><p>Albert married Sarastai shortly after he </p><p>had rescued her, and though she was as </p><p>beautiful as any English girl, he found </p><p>that he was ostracized, and had to give </p><p>up his commission. English folk were no </p><p>more cordial when he brought his 'tar- </p><p>brush’ bride back home to Surrey. So he </p><p>emigrated to the States, fought the full </p><p>four years cf your great Civil War, and </p><p>founded what has since become one of </p><p>the largest fortunes in New Jersey. Still, </p><p>see the toll the thing has taken. Not one </p><p>of Albert Pemberton’s descendants has </p><p>long enjoyed the estate which he built, </p><p>and death by fire has come to all his </p><p>heirs. Looks as if I’m next in line.” </p><p> De Grandin looked at him with nar-</p><p>rowed eyes. "Death by fire, Monsieur?” </p><p> "Quite. Foxcroft’s been burned down</p><p>eight times, and every time it burned </p><p>one or more of Albert Pemberton’s </p><p>descendants died. The first fire killed old </p><p>Albert and his wife; the second took his</p><p>eldest son, and-” </p><p> "One would think rebuilding with ma-</p><p>terials impervious to fire would have oc- </p><p>curred to them-” </p><p>c TT a!” Our visitor’s short laugh was </p><p>far from mirthful. "It did, sir. </p><p>In 1900 Robert Pemberton rebuilt Fox- </p><p>croft of stone, with cement walls and </p><p>floors. He was sitting in his libr’y alone </p><p>at night when the curse took him. No </p><p>fire was burning on the hearth, for it was </p><p>early summer, but somehow the hearth- </p><p>rug got afire and the flames spread to the </p><p>armchair where he dozed. They found </p><p>him, burned almost to a crisp, next </p><p>morning. Cyril Pemberton, from whom </p><p>I take the estate, died in his motorcar </p><p>three months ago. The thing caught fire </p><p>just as he drove in the garage, and he </p><p>fried like an eel before he could so much </p><p>as turn the handle of the door. </p><p> "See here, Doctor de Grandin, you’ve</p><p>just got to help me. When little Jim was </p><p>born I resigned from the army so I could </p><p>be with Avis and the kid. I bought a </p><p>little farm in Hampshire and had settled </p><p>down to be a country gentleman of sorts </p><p>when Cyril died and news of this in- </p><p>heritance came. I sold the farm off at a </p><p>loss to raise funds to come here. If I fail </p><p>to meet the will’s provisions and com- </p><p>plete the twelve months’ residence I’m </p><p>ruined, utterly. You see the fix I’m in?” </p><p>"Completely,” Jules de Grandin nod- </p><p>ded. "Is there any other of your family </p><p>who could claim this estate?” </p><p> "H’m. Yes, there is. I’ve a distant</p><p>cousin named John Ritter who might be </p><p>next in line. We were at Harrow to- </p><p>gether. Jolly rotten chap he was, too. </p><p>Sen! down from Oxford when they </p><p>caught him cheatin’ in a game o’ cards, </p><p>fired out o’ the Indian Civil Administra- </p><p>tion for a lack of recognition of meum </p><p>694 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>el tuum where other fellows’ wives were </p><p>concerned. Now, if Avis and I don’t </p><p>make good and live in this old rookery </p><p>for a full twelve months, we forfeit our </p><p>succession and the whole estate goes to </p><p>this bounder. Not that he could make </p><p>much use of it, but-” </p><p> "How so? Is he uninterested in</p><p>money?” </p><p> "Oh, he’s interested enough, but he’s</p><p>in jail.” </p><p> "Hein? In durance?”</p><p> "Quite. In a Bombay jail, doin’ a life</p><p>stretch for killin’ an outraged husband </p><p>in a brawl. Jolly lucky he was that the </p><p>jury didn’t bring him in guilty of wilful </p><p>murder, tob.” </p><p> "One secs. And how long have you</p><p>resided at Foxcroft?” </p><p> "Just six weeks, sir, and some dam’</p><p>queer things have taken place already.” </p><p> "By example-”</p><p> "Our first night there the bedroom</p><p>furniture caught fire. My wife and I </p><p>w'ere sound asleep, dog-tired from gcttin' </p><p>things in shape, and neither of us would </p><p>have smelled the smoke until it was too </p><p>late, but Laird, my Scottish terrier, was </p><p>slcepin’ by the bed, and he raised such a </p><p>row he woke us up. Queer thing about </p><p>it, too. There was no fire laid in the </p><p>room, and neither Avis nor I’d been </p><p>smokin’, but the bedclothes caught fire, </p><p>just the same, and we didn’t have a sec- </p><p>ond’s spare time standin’ clear. Two days </p><p>later Laird died. Some stinkin’ blighter </p><p>poisoned him. </p><p> "The second week I was ridin’ out</p><p>from the village with some supplies when </p><p>something whizzed past my head, almost </p><p>cuttin’ the tip o’ my nose off. When I </p><p>dismounted for a look around I found a </p><p>knife-blade almost buried in a tree beside </p><p>the road. </p><p> "We’d stocked the place with poultry,</p><p>so that we could have fresh eggs, and </p><p>every bloomin’ chicken died. We can’t </p><p>keep a fowl in the hen-house overnight. </p><p> "Not only that; we’ve heard the</p><p>damn’dest noises round the house— </p><p>things crashing through the underbrush, </p><p>bangings at the doors and windows, and </p><p>the most infernal laughter from the </p><p>woods at dead of night. It’s got us nervy </p><p>as a lot o’ cats, sir. </p><p> "My wife and I both want to stick it,</p><p>as much from principle as for the money, </p><p>but Annie, Avis’ old nurse, not to men- </p><p>tion Appleby, my batman, are all for </p><p>chuckin’ the whole business. They’re sure </p><p>the curse is workin’.” </p><p> De Grandin eyed him thoughtfully.</p><p>"Your case has interest, Monsieur Pem- </p><p>berton,” lie said at last. "If it is conven- </p><p>ient, Doctor Trowbridge and I will come </p><p>to Foxcroft tomorrow afternoon.” </p><p> We shook hands at the front door.</p><p>"See you tomorrow afternoon,” I prom- </p><p>ised as our caller turned away, "if any- </p><p>thing-” </p><p> W hir-r-r-rr! Something flashing silver-</p><p>gray beneath the street lamp’s light came </p><p>hurtling past my head, and a dull thud </p><p>sounded as the missile struck the panel </p><p>of the door. </p><p> "Ha, scelerat, coqu'm, assassin!” cried</p><p>de Grandin, rushing out into the dark- </p><p>ened street. "I have you!” </p><p> But he was mistaken. The sound of</p><p>flying footsteps pounding down the street </p><p>and vanishing around the corner was the </p><p>sole clue to the mystery. </p><p>Breathing hard with rage as much as </p><p>from exertion, he returned and </p><p>wrenched the missile from my scarred </p><p>front door. It was the blade of a cheap </p><p>iron knife, such as may be bought at any </p><p>ten-cent store, its point and edges ground </p><p>to razor sharpness, its wooden helve re- </p><p>moved and the blade-heel weighted with </p><p>ten ounces of crude lead, roughly welded </p><p>on. </p><p> "Ah-ha!” the little Frenchman mur-</p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>695 </p><p>mured as he balanced the crude weapon </p><p>in his palm. "Ah-ha-ha! One begins to </p><p>understand. Tell me, Monsieur, was the </p><p>other knife thrown at you like this one?” </p><p>"Yes, sir, just exactly!” gasped the </p><p>Englishman. </p><p> "One sees, one comprehends; one un-</p><p>derstands. You may be out of India, my </p><p>friend, but you are not away from it.” </p><p>"What d’ye mean?” </p><p> "Me, I have seen the knife-blade</p><p>weighted in this manner for assassina- </p><p>tion, but only in one place.” </p><p> "Where?” asked Pemberton and I in</p><p>chorus. </p><p> "In the interior of Burma. This weap-</p><p>on is as much like those used by dakaits </p><p>of Upper Burma as one pea is like an- </p><p>other in the pod. Tell me, Monsieur le </p><p>Capitaine, did you ever come to grips </p><p>with them in India?” </p><p> "No, sir,” Pemberton replied. "All my</p><p>service was in the South. I never got </p><p>over into Burma.” </p><p> "And you never had a quarrel with</p><p>Indian priests or fakirs?” </p><p> "Positive. Fact is, I always rather liked</p><p>the beggars and got on with ’em first </p><p>rate.” </p><p> "This adds the moutarde piquante to</p><p>our dish. The coincidence of strange </p><p>deaths you relate might be the workings </p><p>of a fakir’s curse; this knife is wholly </p><p>physical, and very deadly. It would seem </p><p>we are attacked on two sides, by super- </p><p>physical assailants operating through the </p><p>thought-waves of that old one’s mal- </p><p>edictions, and by some others who have </p><p>reasons of their own for wishing you to </p><p>be the center ©f attraction at a funeral. </p><p>Good-night again, Monsieur, and a </p><p>healthy journey home.” </p><p>Foxcroft lay among the mountains </p><p>almost at the Pennsylvania border, </p><p>and after consulting road maps we voted </p><p>to go there by train. It was necessary to</p><p>change cars at a small way station, and </p><p>when the local finally came we found </p><p>ourselves unable to get seats together. </p><p>Fortunately for me there was a vacant </p><p>place beside a window, and after stow- </p><p>ing my duffle in the rack I settled down </p><p>to read an interesting but not too plaus- </p><p>ible article on the use of tetraiodophenol- </p><p>phthalein in the diagnosis of diseases of </p><p>the gall bladder. </p><p> Glancing up from my magazine once</p><p>or twice while the baggage car was being </p><p>filled, I noticed several young yokels, </p><p>white and black, lounging on the station </p><p>platform, and wondered idly why two </p><p>young Negroes failed to join the laugh- </p><p>ing group. Instead, they seemed intent on </p><p>something down the track, finally rose </p><p>from the luggage truck on which they </p><p>lounged and walked slowly toward the </p><p>train. Beneath the window where I sat </p><p>they paused a moment, and I noticed they </p><p>were thin almost to emaciation, with </p><p>skins of muddy brown rather than the </p><p>chocolate of the Negro full-blood. Their </p><p>hair, too, was straight as wire, and their </p><p>eyes slate-gray rather than the usual </p><p>brown of Africans. </p><p> "Odd-looking chaps,” I mused as I</p><p>resumed my reading. </p><p> Like most trains used in strictly local</p><p>service, ours was composed of the rail- </p><p>way’s almost cast-off stock. Doors would </p><p>not stay shut, windows would not open. </p><p>Before we’d gone two miles the air with- </p><p>in our coach was almost fetid. I rose </p><p>and staggered up the swaying aisle to </p><p>get a drink of water, only to find the </p><p>tank was empty. After several unsuccess- </p><p>ful efforts I succeeded in forcing back </p><p>the door to the next coach and was in- </p><p>serting a cent in the cup-vending machine </p><p>when a furious hissing forward told me </p><p>someone had yanked the emergency cord. </p><p>The train came to a bumping stop within </p><p>its length, and I stumbled back to our </p><p>coach to find de Grandin, a trainman and </p><p>696 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>several passengers gathered in a knot </p><p>about the seat I had just vacated. </p><p> "This is hideux, my friend!” the little</p><p>Frenchman whispered. "Observe him, if </p><p>you please.” </p><p> I looked, and turned sick at the sight.</p><p>The big countryman who had shared the </p><p>seat with me was slumped down on the </p><p>green-plush covered bench, his throat so </p><p>deeply gashed the head sagged horribly </p><p>upon one shoulder. A spate of blood </p><p>from a severed jugular smeared clothing, </p><p>seat and floor. The window beside which </p><p>I'd sat was smashed to slivers, and bits </p><p>of broken glass lay all around. </p><p> "How—what-” I stammered, and</p><p>for answer Jules de Grandin pointed to </p><p>the floor. Midway in the aisle lay some- </p><p>thing that gleamed dully, the counter- </p><p>part of the lead-weighted blade which </p><p>had been thrown at Pemberton as he left </p><p>my house the night before. </p><p> "Good heavens!” I exclaimed; "if I</p><p>hadn’t gone for water-” </p><p> "Alais out,” de Grandin interrupted.</p><p>"For the first time in a long and useful </p><p>life I find that I can say a word for water </p><p>as a beverage. Undoubtlessly that knife </p><p>was meant for you, my friend.” </p><p> "But why?”</p><p> "Are you not a friend of Monsieur</p><p>Pemberton’s?” </p><p> "Of course, but-”</p><p> "No buts, Friend Trowbridge. Con-</p><p>sider. There were two of those assassins </p><p>at your house last night; at least I judge </p><p>so from the noise they made in flight </p><p>You stood directly in the light from the </p><p>hall lamp when we bid our guest good- </p><p>night; they must have made a note of </p><p>your appearance. Apparently we have </p><p>been under surveillance since then, and it </p><p>is highly probable they heard us say that </p><p>we would visit him today. Voila.”</p><p> We descended from the car and</p><p>walked along the track. "Regardez-vous!” </p><p>he ordered as we reached the window </p><p>where I had been seated. </p><p> Upon the car-side was the crude out-</p><p>line of a grinning skull drawn in white </p><p>crayon. </p><p> "Good Lord—those brown men at the</p><p>station!” I jerked out. "They must have </p><p>drawn this—it seemed to me they were </p><p>not Negroes-” </p><p> "But no. But yes!” he nodded in agree-</p><p>ment. "Indubitably they were not Afri- </p><p>cans, but Burmans. And very bad ones, </p><p>too. This skull is the official signet of the </p><p>goddess Kali, patron deity of thags, and </p><p>the cult of thaggee makes its head- </p><p>quarters in Burma. It is useless to at- </p><p>tempt to apprehend the thrower of the </p><p>knife. By now he has had time to run </p><p>half-way to Burma. But it behooves us </p><p>to be careful how we step. We know </p><p>not where to look for it, or when the </p><p>blow will fall, but deadly peril walks </p><p>with us from this time on. I do not think </p><p>this task which we have undertaken is a </p><p>very healthy one, my friend.” </p><p>Dressed in shabby Oxford bags and a </p><p>khaki shooting-coat, Pemberton was </p><p>waiting for us at the little railway sta- </p><p>tion. </p><p> "Cheerio!” he greeted as we joined</p><p>him. "All quiet on the jolly old Potomac, </p><p>what?” </p><p> "Decidedly,” de Grandin answered,</p><p>then told him of the tragedy. </p><p> "By Jove!” our host exclaimed; "I’m</p><p>shot if I don’t feel like cutting the whole </p><p>rotten business. Taking chances is all </p><p>right for me, just part of the game, </p><p>but to lug my wife into1 this hornets’ </p><p>nest-” he cranked the antiquated </p><p>flivver standing by the platform, and we </p><p>drove in moody silence through the </p><p>groves of black-boughed, whispering </p><p>pines that edged the roadway. </p><p> British genius for getting order out of</p><p>chaos was evident as we arrived at Fox- </p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>697 </p><p>croft. The straggling lawn was neatly </p><p>trimmed, the raffish privet hedge was </p><p>clipped, on the small grass plot were </p><p>several wicker chairs with brightly col- </p><p>ored sailcloth cushions. A line of lush- </p><p>green weeping willows formed a back- </p><p>ground for the weather-mellowed, ivy- </p><p>covered house with its many gables, mul- </p><p>lioned windows and projecting bays. As </p><p>we chugged and wheezed between the </p><p>tall posts of the gateless entranceway a </p><p>young woman quit a gayly-colored canvas </p><p>hammock and walked toward us, waving </p><p>cheerful greeting. </p><p> "Don’t say anything about what hap-</p><p>pened on the train, please,” begged Pem- </p><p>berton as he brought the coughing motor </p><p>to a halt. </p><p> Though definitely brunette, Avis Pem-</p><p>berton was just as definitely British. She </p><p>had wide-spaced, slightly slanting hazel </p><p>eyes, straight, dark hair smoothly parted </p><p>in the middle and drawn low across her </p><p>ears, a broad, white forehead, a small, </p><p>straight nose set above a full-lipped, </p><p>rather w'ide and humorous mouth, and a </p><p>small and pointed diin marked with the </p><p>faint suspicion of a cleft. When she </p><p>smiled, two dimples showed low in her </p><p>cheeks, making a merrily incongruous </p><p>combination with her exotic eyes. She </p><p>was dressed in a twin sweater combina- </p><p>tion, a kilted skirt of Harris tweed, Shet- </p><p>land socks and a pair of Scotch grain </p><p>brogues which, clumsy as they were, </p><p>could not disguise the slimness of her </p><p>feet. Every line of her was long, fine- </p><p>cut, and British as a breath of lavender. </p><p> "Hullo-hullo, old thing,” her husband</p><p>greeted. "Anything untoward occur while </p><p>the good old bread-winner was off?” </p><p> "Nothing, lord and master,” she an-</p><p>swered smilingly as she acknowledged </p><p>his quick introductions, but her hazel </p><p>eyes were wide and thoughtful as the </p><p>little Frenchman raised her fingers to his </p><p>lips at presentation, and I thought I saw </p><p>her cast a frightened glance across her </p><p>shoulder as her husband turned to help </p><p>us drag our duffle from the car.</p><p> Dinner was a rite at Foxcroft, as din-</p><p>ner always is with Britons. A flat bou- </p><p>quet of roses graced the table, four tall </p><p>candles flickered in tall silver standards; </p><p>the soup was cool and underseasoned, the </p><p>joint of mutton tough and underdone, </p><p>the burgundy a little sour, the apple tart </p><p>a sadly soggy thing which might have </p><p>made a billy-goat have nightmares. But </p><p>Pemberton looked spick and span in din- </p><p>ner clothes and his wife was a misty </p><p>vision in rose lace. Appleby, the "bat- </p><p>man” who served Pemberton as servant </p><p>through three army terms and quit the </p><p>service to accompany him in civil life, </p><p>served the meal with faultless technique, </p><p>and brought us something he called </p><p>coffee when the meal was over and we </p><p>congregated on the lawn beneath a </p><p>spreading poplar tree. De Grandin’s air </p><p>of gloom grew deeper by the minute. </p><p>When the servant tendered him a Sevres </p><p>cup filled with the off-brown, faintly </p><p>steaming mixture, I thought he would </p><p>assault him. Instead, he managed some- </p><p>thing like a smile as he turned to our </p><p>hostess. </p><p> "I have heard Monsieur Pemberton</p><p>speak of your son, Madame; is he with </p><p>you in America?” he asked. </p><p> "Oh, dear, no; he’s with my father at</p><p>Lerwick-on-Tyne. You sec, we didn’t </p><p>know just what conditions here might </p><p>be, and thought that he’d be safer at the </p><p>vicarage.” </p><p> "Your father is a churchman, then?”</p><p>"Very much so. It was not till after </p><p>we had Little Jim that he managed to </p><p>forgive me; even now I’m not quite sure </p><p>that he regards me as a proper person to </p><p>have custody of a small boy.” </p><p> "Madame, I am confused. How is it</p><p>you say-” </p><p> The girl laughed merrily. "Father’s</p><p>698 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>terribly low church and mid-Victorian. </p><p>He classes foreigners and Anglo-Catho- </p><p>lics, heathens, actors and Theosophists </p><p>together. When I joined a troupe of </p><p>unit dancers at the Palace he said public </p><p>prayers for me; when I went out to the </p><p>colonies to dance he disowned me as a </p><p>vagabond. I met Big Jim while dancing </p><p>in Bombay, and when I wrote I’d mar- </p><p>ried him the only answer Father sent was </p><p>a note congratulating me on having </p><p>found an officer and gentleman to make </p><p>an honest woman of me. I almost died </p><p>when Little Jim was born, and the doc- </p><p>tors said I could not stand the Indian </p><p>climate, so Big Jim gave up his commis- </p><p>sion and we all went back to England. </p><p>Father wouldn’t see us for almost a year, </p><p>but when we finally took our baby to him </p><p>for baptism he capitulated utterly. He’s </p><p>really an old dear, when you penetrate </p><p>his shell, but if he ever saw me do an </p><p>Indian dance-” </p><p> "You’d have to start from scratch</p><p>again, old thing,” her husband chuckled </p><p>as he lit his pipe. </p><p> "She used to sneak off every chance</p><p>she got and take instructions from the </p><p>native dancers. Got so perfect in the </p><p>technique that if she’d been a little </p><p>darker-skinned she could have passed in </p><p>any temple as a deva-dasi—by Jove, I </p><p>say!” He looked at her as though he saw </p><p>her for the first time. </p><p> "What is it, Jim?”</p><p> "I say, you know, I never noticed it</p><p>before, but there’s a look about you like </p><p>Sarastai. Fine and beautiful, and all that </p><p>sort of-” </p><p> "Oh, Jim darling, stop it! Anyone</p><p>would think—what’s that?” </p><p> " ’elp, ’elp, somebody — ’elp!” the</p><p>shriek came from the house behind us, </p><p>each quavering syllable raw-edged with </p><p>terror. </p><p>WE rushed around the angle of the </p><p>building, through the neatly plant- </p><p>ed kitchen garden and up the three low</p><p>steps that reached the kitchen door. </p><p> "What is it—who is here?” cried de</p><p>Grandin as we paused upon the big </p><p>room’s threshold. </p><p> In the corner farthest from the door</p><p>crouched an aged woman, or perhaps I </p><p>should have said a creature with a </p><p>woman’s body, but a face like nothing </p><p>human. Seamed and lined with countless </p><p>wrinkles, yellowed teeth bared in a </p><p>senseless grin, she squatted by an open </p><p>casement, elbows stiffly bent, hands hang- </p><p>ing loosely, as a begging terrier might </p><p>hold its paws, and mouthed and gibbered </p><p>at us as we stared. </p><p> "Good God!” our host ejaculated.</p><p>"Annie-” </p><p> "Annie! Oh, my poor dear Annie!”</p><p>cried our hostess as she rushed across the </p><p>lamplit kitchen and threw her arms </p><p>around the human caricature crouching in </p><p>the angle of the wall. "What’s wrong </p><p>with her?” she called across her shoul- </p><p>der as she hugged the mouthing crone </p><p>against her bosom. "What’s—O God, </p><p>she’s mad!” </p><p> The woman cringed away from the</p><p>encircling arms. "You won’t ’urt ole </p><p>Annie, will ’ee?” she whimpered. "You </p><p>won’t let the black man get ’er? See”— </p><p>she bared a skinny forearm—" ’e ’urt </p><p>me! ’e ’urt me with a shiny thing!” </p><p> De Grandin drew his breath in sharply</p><p>as he examined the tiny wound which </p><p>showed against the woman’s wrinkled </p><p>skin. "Up to the elbow, mes amis” he </p><p>told us solemnly. "We have stepped in it </p><p>up to the elbow. Me, I know this mark. </p><p>But yes, I have seen him before. The </p><p>devotees of Kali sometimes shoot a serum </p><p>in a victim’s arm with such results. I </p><p>know not what this serum is—and prob- </p><p>ably no white man does—but the Indian </p><p>police know it. ‘Whom the gods destroy </p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>699 </p><p>they first make mad' is no idle proverb </p><p>with the thags of Burma. Non. There is </p><p>no antidote for it. This poor one will be </p><p>gone by morning. Meantime”—he put </p><p>his hands beneath the woman’s arms and </p><p>raised her—"she might as well die in bed </p><p>in Christian fashion. Will you lead us </p><p>to her room, Friend Pemberton?” </p><p> De Grandin on one side, I on the</p><p>other, we half led, half carried the chuck- </p><p>ling, weeping crone along the passage- </p><p>way. A gust of wind swung the long </p><p>casement open and I crossed to close it. </p><p>From the night outside where thickly </p><p>growing rhododendron shut the moon- </p><p>light out there came a laugh like that the </p><p>fiends of hell might give at the arrival </p><p>of a new consignment of lost souls. "Ha- </p><p>ha!—ha-ha-ha!—ha-ha!” </p><p> "Sacre nom, I’ll make you laugh upon</p><p>the other side of your misshapen face!” </p><p>de Grandin cried, dropping the old </p><p>woman’s arm and rushing to the window </p><p>where he leant across the sill and poured </p><p>the contents of his automatic pistol at the </p><p>shadows whence the ghostly laughter </p><p>came. </p><p> A crash of twigs and the flapping-</p><p>back of displaced branches answered, and </p><p>from the further distance came an echo </p><p>of the wild, malignant cachinnation: </p><p>f ’Ha-ha!—ha-ha-ha!—ha-ha!” </p><p>“ A nd now, my friends, it is for us to </p><p>■^^•formulate our strategy',” de Grandin </p><p>told us as we finished breakfast. "From </p><p>the things which we have seen and heard </p><p>I’d say we are beset by human and sub- </p><p>human agencies; possibly working inde- </p><p>pendently, more probably in concert. </p><p>First of all I must go to the village to </p><p>make some purchases and notify the cor- </p><p>oner of your late lamented servant’s </p><p>death. I shall return, but”—he cast the </p><p>phantom of a wink at me—"not for </p><p>luncheon.” </p><p> He was back a little after noon with a</p><p>large, impressive bundle which clanked </p><p>mysteriously each time he shifted it. </p><p>When the papers were removed he</p><p>showed a set of heavy padlocks, each </p><p>complete with hasp and staple. Together </p><p>we went round the big house, fixing locks </p><p>at doors and windows, testing fastenings </p><p>repeatedly; finally, when our task was </p><p>done, repairing to the lawn where Apple- </p><p>by awaited us with a teacart-load of </p><p>toasted muffins, strawberry preserve and </p><p>steaming oolong. </p><p> "What was in that old beer bottle that</p><p>you stood beside the bed?” I asked. "It </p><p>looked like ordinary water.” </p><p> "Water, yes,” he answered with a grin,</p><p>"but not ordinary, I assure you. I have </p><p>the—what you call him?—hunch?—my </p><p>friend. Tonight, perhaps tomorrow, we </p><p>shall have use for what I brought out </p><p>from the village.” </p><p> "But what-”</p><p> "Hullo, there, ready for a spot of tea?”</p><p>called Pemberton. "I’m famished, and </p><p>the little w'oman’s just about to haul her </p><p>colors down.” </p><p> "You are distrait, Madame?” de Gran-</p><p>din asked, dropping into a w'illow chair </p><p>and casting a suspicious glance upon the </p><p>tray of muffins Appleby extended. </p><p> "Indeed, I am. I’ve been feeling devils</p><p>all day long.” She smiled at him a little </p><p>wearily above her teacup rim. "Some- </p><p>thing’s seemed to boil up in me—it’s </p><p>the queerest thing, but I’ve had an urge </p><p>to dance, an almost irresistible impulse to </p><p>put an Indian costume on and do the </p><p>Bramara—the Bee-dance. I know it’s </p><p>dreadful to feel so, with poor old Annie’s </p><p>body lying by the wall and this menace </p><p>hanging over us, but something seems to </p><p>urge me almost past resistance to put my </p><p>costume on and dance-” </p><p> "Tiens, Madame, one comprehends,”</p><p>he smiled agreement. "I, too, have felt </p><p>these so queer urges. Regardez, s’il vous </p><p>plait: We are beset by mental stress, we </p><p>700 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>look about us for escape and there seems </p><p>none; then suddenly from somewhere </p><p>comes an urge unbidden. Perhaps it is to </p><p>take a drink of tea; maybe we feel im- </p><p>pelled to walk out in the rain; quite pos- </p><p>sibly the urge comes to sit down and </p><p>strum at the piano, or, as in your case, to </p><p>dance. Reason is a makeshift thing, at </p><p>best. We have used it but a scant half- </p><p>million years; our instincts reach back </p><p>to the days when we crawled in primeval </p><p>ooze. Trust instinct, Madame. Something </p><p>boils within you, you declare? Tres bien. </p><p>It is your ego seeking liberation. Permit </p><p>the boiling to continue; then, when the </p><p>effete matter rises to the top, we skim </p><p>him off”—with his hand he made a ges- </p><p>ture as of scooping something up—"and </p><p>throw him out. V oil a. We have got rid </p><p>of that which worries us!” </p><p> “You think I should give way to it?”</p><p> “But certainly, of course; why not?</p><p>This evening after dinner, if you still </p><p>have the urge to dance, we shall delight </p><p>to watch you and applaud your art.” </p><p>Tea finished, Appleby, de Grandin </p><p>and I set out on a reconnaissance. </p><p>We walked across the grass plot to the </p><p>copse of evergreens from which the </p><p>weird laughter came the night before and </p><p>searched the ground on hands and knees. </p><p>Our search was fruitless, for pine needles </p><p>lay so thick upon the ground that nothing </p><p>like a footprint could be found. </p><p> Behind the house stood barn and hen-</p><p>coops, the latter empty, Pemberton’s </p><p>archaic flivver and two saddle-horses ten- </p><p>anting the former. “It’s queer the place </p><p>should be so much run down, considering </p><p>the family’s wealth,” I murmured as we </p><p>neared the stable. </p><p> “The former howner was a most hex-</p><p>centric man, sir,” Appleby supplied. “ ’e </p><p>never seemed to care about the plyce, and </p><p>didn’t live ’ere hany more than necess’ry. </p><p>Hi've ’eard ’e honly used hit as a sort o’ </p><p>—my Gawd, wot’s that?” He pointed to </p><p>a little mound of earth beside the barn </p><p>foundation.</p><p> De Grandin took a step or two in the</p><p>direction of the little hillock, then </p><p>paused, his small nose wrinkled in dis- </p><p>gust. "It has the perfume of corrup- </p><p>tion,” he remarked. </p><p> "W’y, hit’s pore hold Laird, the mas-</p><p>ter’s dawg, sir,” Appleby returned ex- </p><p>citedly. "Who’s done this thing to ’im? </p><p>Hi dug ’is gryve meself, sir, w’en we </p><p>found ’im dead, hand Hi took partic’lar </p><p>pynes to myke hit deep hand strong, </p><p>’eaped a thumpin’ boulder hon ’im, sir, </p><p>Hi did, but now-” </p><p> "One sees, and smells,” de Grandin in-</p><p>terrupted. "He has been resurrected, but </p><p>not restored to life.” </p><p> The cockney leant above the violated</p><p>grave to push the earth back in. "Picked </p><p>clean ’e is, sir,” he reported. " ’e couldn’t </p><p>be no cleaner hif a stinkin’ buzzard ’ad </p><p>been hat ’im.” </p><p> The little Frenchman tweaked the</p><p>needle points of his wheat-blond mus- </p><p>tache between a thoughtful thumb and </p><p>forefinger. "It is possible—quite prob- </p><p>able,” he murmured. "They have im- </p><p>ported every other sort of devilment; why </p><p>not this one?” </p><p> "What?” I demanded. "Who’s im-</p><p>ported what-” </p><p> "Zut! We have work to do, my friend.</p><p>Do you begin here at this spot and walk </p><p>in ever-widening circles. Eventually, un- </p><p>less I miss my guess, you will come upon </p><p>the tracks of a large dog. When you have </p><p>found them, call me, if you please.” </p><p> I followed his instructions while he</p><p>and Appleby walked toward the house. </p><p> In fifteen or twenty minutes I reached</p><p>a patch of soft earth where pine needles </p><p>did not lie too thick to cover tracks, </p><p>and there, plain as the cannibals’ mark </p><p>on the sands of Crusoe’s island, showed </p><p>the paw-print of a giant dog. </p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>701 </p><p> "Hullo, de Grandin!” I began. "I’ve</p><p>found-” </p><p> A crashing in the undergrowth near</p><p>by cut short my hail, and I drew the </p><p>pistol which de Grandin had insisted that </p><p>I carry as the thing or person neared me. </p><p> The rhododendron brandies parted as</p><p>a pair of groping hands thrust forth, and </p><p>Appleby came staggering out. "Th’ black </p><p>’un, sir,” he gasped in a hoarse voice. </p><p>"Hi passed ’im ’fore I knew it, sir, then </p><p>seen ’is turban shinin’ hin th’ leaves. </p><p>I myde to shoot ’im, but 'e stuck me </p><p>with a forked stick. Hi’m a-dyin’, sir, </p><p>a-dy-” </p><p> He dropped upon the grass, the fatal</p><p>word half uttered, made one or two </p><p>convulsive efforts to regain his feet, then </p><p>slumped down on his face. </p><p> "De Grandin!” I called frenziedly. "I</p><p>say, de Grandin-” </p><p> He was beside me almost as I finished</p><p>calling, and together we cut the poor </p><p>chap’s trouser leg away, disclosing two </p><p>small parallel pin-pricks in the calf of his </p><p>left leg. A little spot of ecchymosis, like </p><p>the bruise left by a blow, was round the </p><p>wounds, and beyond it showed an area </p><p>of swelled and reddened skin, almost </p><p>like a scald. When de Grandin made a </p><p>small incision with his knife in the </p><p>bruised flesh, then pressed each side the </p><p>wounds, the blood oozed thickly, almost </p><p>like a semi-hardened gelatin. </p><p> "Cest fini” he pronounced as he rose</p><p>and brushed his knees. "He did not have </p><p>a chance, that poor one. This settles it.” </p><p> "What settles what?”</p><p> "This, parbleu! If we needed further</p><p>proof that we are menaced by a band of </p><p>desperate dakaits we have it now. It </p><p>is the mark and sign-manual of the </p><p>criminal tribes of Burma. The man is </p><p>dead of cobra venom—but these wounds </p><p>were not made by a snake’s fangs.” </p><p>“T&gt; ut good heavens, man, if this keeps</p><p>A-* up there won’t be one of us to tell </p><p>the tale!” cried Pemberton as we com- </p><p>pleted ministering to Appleby’s remains. </p><p>"Twice they almost got me with their </p><p>knives; they almost murdered Doctor </p><p>Trowbridge; they’ve done for Annie and </p><p>poor Appleby-” </p><p> "Exactement,” de Grandin nodded.</p><p>"But this w'ill not keep up. Tonight, this </p><p>very evening, we shall call their prom- </p><p>ontory—non, I mean their bluff. The co- </p><p>incidences of your kinsmen’s deaths by </p><p>fire, those might have been attributed to </p><p>Hindoo curses; myself, I think they are; </p><p>but these deliberate murders and at- </p><p>tempts at murder are purely human do- </p><p>ings. Your cousin, Monsieur Ritter-” </p><p> "Not an earthly!” Pemberton smiled</p><p>grimly. "Did you ever see a British </p><p>Indian jail? Not quite as easy to walk </p><p>out of ’em as it is from an American </p><p>prison-” </p><p> "Notwithstanding which, Monsieur”</p><p>—the little Frenchman smiled sarcastical- </p><p>ly—"this Monsieur Ritter is at large, and </p><p>probably within a gun-shot of us now. </p><p>When I was in the village this forenoon </p><p>I cabled the police at Bombay. The </p><p>answer came within three hours: </p><p> John Ritter, serving a life term, escaped four</p><p>months ago. His whereabouts unknown. </p><p> "You see? His jai 1-break almost coin-</p><p>cided with the passing of your kinsman </p><p>in America. He knew about the family </p><p>curse, undoubtlessly, and determined to </p><p>make profit by it. But he was practical, </p><p>that one. Mais oui. He did not intend to </p><p>wait the working of a curse which might </p><p>be real or only fanciful. Not he, by blue! </p><p>He bought the service of a crew of </p><p>Burman cutthroats, and they came with </p><p>all their bag of villain’s tricks—their </p><p>knives, their subtle poisons, even an </p><p>hyena! That it was your servants and not </p><p>you who met their deaths is not attribut- </p><p>702 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>able to any kindness on his part, but </p><p>merely to good fortune. Your turns will </p><p>come, unless-” </p><p> "Unless we hook it while we have the</p><p>chance!” </p><p> "Unless you do exactly as I say,” de</p><p>Grandin finished without notice of the </p><p>interruption. "In five minutes it will be </p><p>ten o’clock. I suggest we seek our rooms, </p><p>but not to sleep. You, Monsieur, and </p><p>you, Madame, will see that both your </p><p>doors and windows are securely fastened. </p><p>Meantime, Doctor Trowbridge and I will </p><p>repair to our chamber and—eh bien, I </p><p>think we shall see things!” </p><p>Despite de Grandin’s admonition, I </p><p>fell fast asleep. How long I’d slept </p><p>I do not know, nor do I recall what wak- </p><p>ened me. There was no perceptible </p><p>sound, but suddenly I was sitting bolt- </p><p>upright, staring fascinated at our win- </p><p>dow’s shadowed oblong. "Lucky thing </p><p>we put those locks on,” I reassured my- </p><p>self; "almost anything might-” </p><p> The words died on my tongue, and a</p><p>prickling sensation traced my spine. </p><p>What it was I did not know, but every </p><p>sense seemed warning me of dreadful </p><p>danger. </p><p> "De Grandin!” I whispered hoarsely.</p><p>"De Grandin-” </p><p> I reached across the bed to waken him.</p><p>My hand encountered nothing but the </p><p>blanket. I was in that tomb-black room </p><p>with nothing but my fears for company. </p><p> Slowly, scarcely faster than the hand</p><p>that marks the minutes on the clock, the </p><p>window-sash swung back. The heavy lock </p><p>we’d stapled on was gone or broken. I </p><p>heard the creak of rusty hinges, caught </p><p>the faint rasp of a bar against the outer </p><p>sill, and my breath went hot and sulfur- </p><p>ous in my throat as a shadow scarcely </p><p>darker than the outside night obscured </p><p>the casement. </p><p> It was like some giant dog—a mastiff</p><p>or great Dane—but taller, heavier, with </p><p>a mane of unkempt hair about its neck. </p><p>Pointed ears cocked forward, great eyes </p><p>gleaming palely phosphorescent, it </p><p>pressed against the slowly yielding win- </p><p>dow-frame. And now I caught the sil- </p><p>houette of its hog-snouted head against </p><p>the window, saw its parted, sneering lips, </p><p>smelled the retching stench that emanated </p><p>from it, and went sick with horror. The </p><p>thing was a hyena, a grave-robber, offal- </p><p>cater, most loathsome of all animals. </p><p> Slowly, inch by cautious inch, it crept</p><p>into the room, fangs bared in a snarl that </p><p>held the horrible suggestion of a sneer. </p><p>"Help, de Grandin—help!” I shrieked, </p><p>leaping from the bed and dragging </p><p>tangled blankets with me as a shield. </p><p> The hyena sprang. With a cry that</p><p>was half growl, half obscene parody of a </p><p>human chuckle, it launched itself through </p><p>the intervening gloom, and next instant I </p><p>was smothered underneath its weight as </p><p>it worried savagely at the protecting </p><p>blanket. </p><p> tfSa-ha, Monsieur VHyene, you seek a</p><p>meal? Take this!” Close above me Jules </p><p>de Grandin swung a heavy kukri knife as </p><p>though it were a headsman’s ax, striking </p><p>through the wiry mane, driving deep into </p><p>the brute’s thick neck, almost decapitat- </p><p>ing lt </p><p> "Get up, my friend; arise,” he ordered</p><p>as he hauled me from beneath the bed- </p><p>clothes, already soaking with the foul </p><p>beast’s blood. "Me, I have squatted none </p><p>too patiently behind the bed, waiting for </p><p>the advent of that one. Morbleu, I </p><p>thought that he would never come!” </p><p> "How’d you know about it-” I</p><p>began, but he cut me short with a soft </p><p>chuckle. </p><p> "The laughter in the bush that night,</p><p>the small dog’s ravished grave, finally </p><p>the tracks you found today. They made </p><p>the case complete. I made elaborate show </p><p>of opening our window, and they must </p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>703 </p><p>have found the others fastened; so they </p><p>determined to send their pet before them </p><p>to prepare the way. He was savage, that </p><p>one, but so am I, by blue! Come, let us </p><p>tell our host and hostess of our visitor.” </p><p>The next day was a busy one. Sheriff’s </p><p>deputies and coroner’s assistants </p><p>came in almost ceaseless streams, ques- </p><p>tioning endlessly, making notes of every- </p><p>thing, surveying the thicket where Apple- </p><p>by was killed and the kitchen where old </p><p>Annie met her fate. At last the dreary </p><p>routine ended, the mortician took away </p><p>the bodies, and the Pembertons faced us </p><p>solemn-eyed across the dinner table. </p><p> "I’m for chucking the whole rotten</p><p>business,” our host declared. "They’ve </p><p>got two of us-” </p><p> "And we have one of them,” supplied</p><p>de Grandin. "Anon we shall have-” </p><p> "We’re cutting out of here tomorrow,”</p><p>broke in Pemberton. "I'll go to selling </p><p>cotton in the city, managing estates or </p><p>clerking in a shop before I’ll subject Avis </p><p>to this peril one more day.” </p><p> "C’est I’enfant illage!” declared de</p><p>Grandin. "When success is almost in </p><p>your hand you would retreat? Fi done, </p><p>Monsieur!” </p><p> "Fi done or otherwise, we’re going in</p><p>the morning,” Pemberton replied de- </p><p>terminedly. </p><p> "Very well, let it be as you desire.</p><p>Meantime, have you still the urge to </p><p>dance, Madame?” </p><p> Avis Pemberton glanced up from her</p><p>teacup with something like a guilty look. </p><p>"More than ever,” she returned so low </p><p>that we could scarcely catch her words. </p><p> "Tres bien. Since this will be our last</p><p>night in the house, permit that we enjoy </p><p>your artistry.” </p><p> Her preparations were made quickly.</p><p>We cleared a space in the big drawing- </p><p>room, rolling back the rugs to bare the </p><p>polished umber tiles of which the floor </p><p>was made. Upon a chair she set a small </p><p>hand-gramophone, needle ready poised, </p><p>then hurried to her room to don her </p><p>costume. </p><p> "Ecoutez, s’il vous plait,” de Grandin</p><p>begged, tiptoeing from the drawing- </p><p>room, returning in a moment with the </p><p>water-filled beer bottle which he had </p><p>brought from the village, the kukri knife </p><p>with which he killed the hyena, and a </p><p>pair of automatic pistols. One of these he </p><p>pressed on me, the other on our host. </p><p>"Have watchfulness, my friends,” he </p><p>bade in a low whisper. "When the music </p><p>for the dance commences it is likely to </p><p>attract an uninvited audience. Should </p><p>anyone appear at either window, I beg </p><p>you to shoot first and make inquiries </p><p>afterward.” </p><p> "Hadn’t we better close the blinds?”</p><p>I asked. "Because if we’re likely to be </p><p>watched-” </p><p> "Mais non,” he negatived. "See, there</p><p>is no light here save that the central </p><p>lamp casts down, and that will shine di- </p><p>rectly on Madame. We shall be in </p><p>shadow, but anyone who seeks to peer in </p><p>through the window will be visible </p><p>against the moonlight. You compre- </p><p>hend?” </p><p> "I’d like to have a final go at ’em,”</p><p>our host replied. "Even if I got only </p><p>one, it’d help to even things for Appleby </p><p>and Annie.” </p><p> "I quite agree,” de Grandin nodded.</p><p>"Now—s-s-sh; silence. Madame comes!” </p><p> The chiming clink of ankle bells an-</p><p>nounced her advent, and as she crossed </p><p>the threshold with a slow, sensuous </p><p>walk, hips rolling, feet flat to floor, one </p><p>set directly before the other, I leant for- </p><p>ward in amazement. Never had I thought </p><p>that change of costume could so change a </p><p>personality. Yet there it was. In tweeds </p><p>and Shetlands Avis Pemberton was Brit- </p><p>ish as a sunrise over Surrey, or a Christ- </p><p>mas pageant Columbine; this sleekly </p><p>704 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>black-haired figure rippling past us with </p><p>the grace of softly flowing water was a </p><p>daughter of the gods, a temple deva-dasi, </p><p>the mystery and allure and unfathomable </p><p>riddle of the East incarnate. Her bodice </p><p>was of saffron silk, sheer as net. Cut with </p><p>short shoulder-sleeves and rounded neck </p><p>it terminated just below her small, firm </p><p>breasts and was edged with imitation </p><p>emeralds and small opals which kindled </p><p>into witch-fires in the lamplight’s glow. </p><p>From breast to waist her slim, firm form </p><p>was bare, slender as an adolescent boy’s, </p><p>yet full enough to keep her ribs from </p><p>showing in white lines against the creamy </p><p>skin. A smalt-blue cincture had been </p><p>tightly bound about her slender waist, </p><p>emphasizing gently swelling hips and </p><p>supporting a full, many-pleated skirt of </p><p>cinnabar-red silken gauze. Across her </p><p>smoothly parted blue-black hair was </p><p>thrown a sari of deep blue with silver </p><p>edging, falling down across one shoulder </p><p>and caught coquettishly within the curve </p><p>of a bent elbow. Silver bracelets hung </p><p>with little hawk-bells bound her wrists; </p><p>heavy bands of hammered silver with a </p><p>fringe of silver tassels that flowed rip- </p><p>pling to the floor and almost hid her feet </p><p>were ringed about each ankle. Between </p><p>her startlingly black brows there burned </p><p>the bright vermilion of a caste mark. </p><p>Pemberton pressed the lever of the </p><p>gramophone and a flood of liquid </p><p>music flowed into the room. Deep, plain- </p><p>tive chords came from the guitar, the </p><p>viols wept and crooned by turns, and the </p><p>drums beat out an amatory rhythm. She </p><p>paused a moment in the swing-lamp’s </p><p>golden disk of light, feet close together, </p><p>knees straight, arms raised above her </p><p>head, wrists interlaced, the right hand </p><p>facing left, the left turned to the right, </p><p>and each pressed to the other, palm to </p><p>palm and finger against finger. The </p><p>music quickened and she moved her feet </p><p>in a swift, shuffling step, setting ankle </p><p>bells a-chime, swaying like a palm tree </p><p>in the rising breeze. She took the folds </p><p>of her full skirt between joined thumbs </p><p>and forefingers, daintily, as one might </p><p>take a pinch of snuff, spread the gleam- </p><p>ing, many-pleated tissue out fanwise, and</p><p>advanced with a slow, gliding step. Her </p><p>head bent sidewise, now toward this sleek </p><p>shoulder, now toward that; then slowly </p><p>it sank back, her long eyes almost closed, </p><p>like those of one who falls into a swoon </p><p>of unsupportable delight; her red lips </p><p>parted, fell apart as though they had </p><p>gone flaccid with satiety after ecstasy. </p><p>Then she dropped forward in a deep </p><p>salaam, head bent submissively, both </p><p>hands upraised with thumbs and fore- </p><p>fingers together. </p><p> I was about to beat my hands to-</p><p>gether in applause when de Grandin’s </p><p>grip upon my elbow halted me. "Les </p><p>jlammes, mon ami, regardez-vous—les </p><p>famines!” he whispered. </p><p> Across the vitric umber tiles that made</p><p>the floor, a line of flame was rising, </p><p>flickering and dancing, wavering, flaunt- </p><p>ing, advancing steadily, and I could smell </p><p>the spicy-sweet aroma of burnt sandal- </p><p>wood. "It is the flame from that old, </p><p>cheated funeral pyre,” he breathed. "The </p><p>vengeance-flame that burned the old one </p><p>to a crisp while he lay in a fireproof </p><p>room; the flame that set this house afire </p><p>eight times; the flame of evil genius that </p><p>pursues this family. See how easily I con- </p><p>quer it!” </p><p> With an agile leap he crossed the</p><p>room, raised the bottle he had brought </p><p>and spilled a splash of water on the </p><p>crackling, leaping fire-tongues. It was </p><p>as if a picture drawn in chalks were </p><p>wiped away, or an image on a motion- </p><p>picture screen obliterated as the light be- </p><p>hind the film dies; for everywhere the </p><p>drops of water fell, the flames died into </p><p>blackness with a sullen, scolding hiss. </p><p> W. T.—4</p><p>FLAMES OF VENGEANCE </p><p>705, </p><p>Back and forth across the line of fire he </p><p>hurried, throwing water on the fluttering, </p><p>dazzling flares till all were dead and cold. </p><p> "The window, mes amis, look to the</p><p>window! Shoot if you see faces!” he </p><p>ordered as he fought the dying fire. </p><p> Both Pemberton and I looked up as</p><p>he called out, and I felt a sudden tighten- </p><p>ing in my throat as my eyes came level </p><p>with the window. Framed in the panes </p><p>were three faces, two malignant, brown </p><p>and scowling, one a sun-burned white, </p><p>but no less savage. The dark men I re- </p><p>membered instantly. It was they who </p><p>stood beside the train the day the knife </p><p>was thrown to kill the man who shared </p><p>the seat with me. But the frowning, curs- </p><p>ing white man was a stranger. </p><p> Even as I looked I saw one of the</p><p>brown men draw his hand back and </p><p>caught the glimmer of a poised knife- </p><p>blade. I raised my pistol and squeezed </p><p>hard upon the trigger, but the mechan- </p><p>ism jammed, and I realized the knife- </p><p>man had me at his mercy. </p><p> But Pemberton’s small weapon an-</p><p>swered to his pressure, and the stream of </p><p>W. T.—5 </p><p>bullets crashed against the glass, sent it </p><p>shattering in fragments, and bored </p><p>straight through the scowling coun- </p><p>tenances, making little sharp-edged pits </p><p>in them like those a stream of sprinkled </p><p>water makes when turned upon damp </p><p>clay, except that where these little pock- </p><p>marks showed there spread a smear of </p><p>crimson. </p><p> There was something almost comic in</p><p>the look of pained surprize the faces </p><p>showed as the storm of bullets swept </p><p>across them. Almost, it seemed to me, </p><p>they voiced a protest at an unexpected </p><p>trick; as though they’d come to witness </p><p>an amusing spectacle, only to discover </p><p>that the joke was turned on them, and </p><p>they had no relish for the role of victim. </p><p>“'*7“ES, it’s Ritter, all right,” Pember- </p><p> jl ton pronounced as we turned the</p><p>bodies over in the light of an electric </p><p>torch.

"We have at once </p><p>disposed of everything, my friend. The </p><p>human villains who would murder you </p><p>and Madame Pemberton, the working of </p><p>the ancient curse pronounced so many </p><p>years ago—all are eliminated!” </p><p> He leant above the body of a prostrate</p><p>Indian, searching through his jacket with </p><p>careful fingers. "Ah-ba, behold him!” he </p><p>commanded. "Here is the thing that </p><p>killed your so unfortunate retainer.” He </p><p>held a length of bamboo stick fitted at </p><p>the end with something like a tuning- </p><p>fork to which a rubber bulb was fixed. </p><p>"Careful!” he warned as I readied out to </p><p>touch it. "The merest prick of those sharp </p><p>points is certain death.” </p><p> Pressing the queer instrument against</p><p>the wall, he pointed to twin spots of </p><p>visdd, yellow liquid sticking to the </p><p>stones. "Cobric acid—concentrated es- </p><p>sence of the cobra’s venom,” he ex- </p><p>plained. "One drives these points into </p><p>his victim’s body—the sharp steel pen- </p><p>etrates through clothing where a snake’s </p><p>fangs might not pierce — and pouf! </p><p>enough snake-poison goes into the poor </p><p>bne’s veins to cause death in three </p><p>minutes. Tiens, it is a clever little piece </p><p>of devilment, riest-ce-pas?” </p><p> "D’ye think we got ’em all?” asked</p><p>Pemberton. </p><p> "Indubitably. Had there been more,</p><p>they would have been here. Consider: </p><p>First they set their foul beast on us, </p><p>believing he will kill some one of us, at </p><p>least.

"There was, my friend, and this is </p><p>he,” he answered shortly. "Your charm- </p><p>ing cousin, Monsieur Ritter. It was he </p><p>who hid beside the tracks and hurled the </p><p>knife when he beheld the mark of Kali. </p><p>The Burmans knew friend Trowbridge; </p><p>had it been one of them who lay in am- </p><p>bush he would not have wasted knife or </p><p>energy in killing the wrong man, but </p><p>Ritter had no other guide than the skull </p><p>chalked on the car. Tenez, he threw the </p><p>knife that killed the poor young man to </p><p>death.” </p><p> "How do you account for the fire that</p><p>broke out just as Mrs. Pemberton had </p><p>finished dancing?” I asked. </p><p> "There is no scientific explanation for</p><p>it, at least no explanation known to </p><p>modern chemistry or physics. We must </p><p>seek deeper—farther—for its reason. </p><p>Those Hindoo gurus, they know things. </p><p>They can cast a rope into the air and </p><p>make it stand so rigidly that one may </p><p>climb it. They take a little, tiny seed and </p><p>place it in the earth, and there, before </p><p>your doubting eyes, it grows and puts </p><p>forth leaves and flowers.

Now, </p><p>if their ordinary showmen can do things </p><p>like that, how much more able are their </p><p>true adepts to bring forth fire at will, or </p><p>on the happening of specific things? The </p><p>rescue of the Hindoo girl Sarastai left </p><p>the funeral pyre without a victim, and so </p><p>the old priests placed a curse on her and </p><p>hers, decreeing fire should take its toll </p><p>of all her husband’s family till kinsman </p><p>had shed kinsman’s blood. That was the </p><p>fire that followed every generation of the </p><p>Pembertons. This fire burned this house </p><p>again, and yet again, burned one when he </p><p>lay in safety in a fireproof room—even </p><p>set a motorcar afire to kill the late pro- </p><p>prietor of the estate. </p><p> "Tonight conditions were ideal. The</p><p>sacred music of the temple sounded </p><p>from the gramaphone, Madame Avis </p><p>danced in Hindoo costume; danced an </p><p>old, old dance, perhaps the very dance </p><p>Sarastai used to dance. Our thoughts were </p><p>tuned to India—indeed, there is no doubt </p><p>the urge which prompted Madame Pem- </p><p>berton to dance a Hindoo dance in Hin- </p><p>doo costume came directly from the </p><p>thought-waves set in motion by those old </p><p>priests in the days of long ago. The very </p><p>stones of this old house are saturated in </p><p>malignant thought-waves—thoughts of </p><p>vengeance — and Madame Avis was </p><p>caught up in them and forced along the </p><p>pathway toward destruction. All was pre- </p><p>pared, conditions were ideal, the victims </p><p>waited ready for the flames. Only one </p><p>thing that old priest forgot to foresee.” </p><p> "Jolly interestin’,” murmured Pem-</p><p>berton. "What was it he forgot?” </p><p> "That you would ask advice of Jules</p><p>de Grandin!” my little friend grinned </p><p>shamelessly. "There it was he missed his </p><p>trick. I am very clever.

In the cock- </p><p>pit at the stern, David Russell stood over </p><p>the wheel, his lean, brown, bareheaded </p><p>figure bent forward, his smiling gray </p><p>eyes watching his wife. </p><p> Christa Russell was earnestly coiling</p><p>ropes on the deck forward. Now she </p><p>finished and came back toward him, a </p><p>slim, boyish little figure in white slacks </p><p>and blue jersey. Her soft, dark eyes, </p><p>always oddly serious beneath her childish </p><p>forehead and smoothly brushed black </p><p>hair, met her husband’s and returned his </p><p>smile.</p><p> "Happy, kid?” he asked, his arm</p><p>going around her slender waist as she </p><p>jumped down into the cockpit to his </p><p>side. </p><p> She nodded, her uplifted eyes adoring.</p><p>"It’s the best honeymoon anyone ever </p><p>had, David. Just you and me and the sea.” </p><p> He grinned. "I felt a little guilty about</p><p>dragging you on a risky cruise like this, </p><p>but you’ve been the best sailing partner </p><p>I ever had. And the only one who could </p><p>really cook.” </p><p> He added, “Speaking of cooking, sup-</p><p>pose you get down in that galley and </p><p>exercise your talents, gal. I’m hungry.” </p><p> Christa said dismayedly, "Oh, I’d for-</p><p>gotten all about lunch. I’ll only be a few </p><p>minutes.” </p><p> She disappeared hurriedly down the</p><p>companionway. Left alone, David Rus- </p><p>sell drew a long breath of utter content- </p><p>ment. His gray eyes swept the horizon </p><p>happily. Sunlight and sea7 a good boat </p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>709 </p><p>and a good wind, and his young wife— </p><p>what more could any man want? </p><p> They had been married in Bermuda</p><p>two weeks before. And David had pro- </p><p>posed this cruise to the Azores in his yawl </p><p>as a honeymoon. Fine weather and fa- </p><p>voring winds had made it a dream </p><p>voyage of sun-drenched days and moon- </p><p>silvered nights. </p><p> David suddenly stiffened at the wheel.</p><p>He had glimpsed something just ahead </p><p>that was—queer. It was a strange, great </p><p>flicker in the air, a wavering of light like </p><p>the refraction of air above hot railway </p><p>tracks. The whole area just ahead of the </p><p>onward-racing yawl seemed flickering </p><p>oddly like that. </p><p> He felt a sudden tinge of dim fear, of</p><p>alarm. He moved his hand on the wheel </p><p>to guide the yawl away from that weirdly </p><p>flickering area. But before he could do </p><p>so, the speeding boat had run directly </p><p>into the edge of the queer area. The next </p><p>moment- </p><p> A big island loomed dead ahead in the</p><p>sea! </p><p> It was like hell-born magic to David's</p><p>stunned brain. One moment he was sail- </p><p>‘He fell with outstretched xnetcd arms crashing purposefully down against tho giant crystal. </p><p>[ZIQ </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>ing with no speck of land in sight in the </p><p>vast blue waste. Next moment, without </p><p>warning, this island had suddenly clicked </p><p>into sight, not a hundred yards ahead of </p><p>the yawl. </p><p> David’s stupefied eyes glimpsed the</p><p>isle as a heavily forested mass of land, </p><p>several miles across, towering to frown- </p><p>ing black cliffs at its center. The shores </p><p>were fringed with cruel, jagged rocks </p><p>that showed like broken black fangs </p><p>through the foam of wild waves break- </p><p>ing over them. </p><p> The yawl was running headlong onto</p><p>these rocks, without chance of being </p><p>turned in time. David, his face a gray </p><p>mask of stupefied horror, dropped the </p><p>wheel and yelled hoarsely. </p><p> "Christa! Quick!”</p><p> She came darting up the companion-</p><p>way, face white with alarm. "David, </p><p>what-” </p><p> He grabbed her. At that instant, with</p><p>terrific, grinding shock, the yawl struck </p><p>the rocks. </p><p> They were thrown clear of its wildly</p><p>tilting deck by the impact. And almost </p><p>instantly they were sinking in the roar- </p><p>ing waters, David still blindly gripping </p><p>his wife. </p><p>Thunder of the rushing waves was </p><p>in his ears as they went down and </p><p>down in the cold currents. He shifted his </p><p>grip on Christa, and fought frantically </p><p>with his other arm to rise. He came up, </p><p>half strangled, to be nearly smothered </p><p>by white foam and deafened by the roar- </p><p>ing bellow of breaking waves. </p><p> They were flung like chips toward the</p><p>jagged shore rocks. David struck out </p><p>with his free arm in mad strokes to keep </p><p>them away from the cruel stone fangs </p><p>upon which the waves would hammer </p><p>them to pulp. His left arm still gripped </p><p>Christa with frantic strength as they were </p><p>hurled forward. </p><p> His right shoulder grazed hidden rock,</p><p>his shirt ripping and a brand of fire </p><p>seeming to sear along his arm. As he was </p><p>whirled around by the wild waves that </p><p>were tossing them, he glimpsed the yawl, </p><p>piled on the outer rocks, being ham- </p><p>mered by the smashing waves. </p><p> The waves were hurling them on</p><p>toward those menacing black teeth with </p><p>the swiftness of a mill-race. A flat, jag- </p><p>ged ledge rose a few feet from the foam- </p><p>ing waters just ahead. The charging </p><p>waves flung them hard against it. </p><p> David took the impact on his right</p><p>shoulder, and felt the flesh bruise from </p><p>the savage blow. With his numbed right </p><p>arm he clawed wildly to cling to the </p><p>edge of the ledge, a foot above his head. </p><p>His fingertips gained the rim, then were </p><p>torn loose as the receding waves sucked </p><p>the two helpless humans back. </p><p> Back and back—and then again they</p><p>bore them forward, like raging stallions </p><p>of the sea, toward the ledge of rock. </p><p>David felt his strength leaving him, </p><p>knew desperately that he could not hold </p><p>Christa longer, that if the waves swept </p><p>them back out again, they would sink </p><p>together. </p><p> The rushing waters again flung them</p><p>like floating puppets against the rock. </p><p>David's head hit the wall and he saw </p><p>blinding light, felt the last remnants of </p><p>strength melting from the stunning blow. </p><p>Yet knowledge of death close at hand </p><p>made him claw frenziedly for the ledge. </p><p> His fingers again gripped its brink—-</p><p>but his nerveless body had not the </p><p>strength to haul them up onto it. </p><p>Through the bellowing din, icy death </p><p>seemed stooping to enfold them in his </p><p>cold shroud. Then before the waters </p><p>sucked back, a wave higher than the </p><p>others lifted David and the girl a little-, </p><p>With a supreme effort, he used thafi </p><p>moment to roll with her onto the ledge* </p><p> He lay there, hearing only dimly the</p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>711 </p><p>raging of the baffled seas just below him, </p><p>the splatter of salty spray on his face. </p><p>He was aware that Christa was bending </p><p>frantically over him, as his consciousness </p><p>darkened. </p><p> "David! David dear!” Her sobbing</p><p>voice came thinly and remotely to his </p><p>fading hearing. "David, we’re safe now. </p><p>I’ll get help—get someone-” </p><p> And then there was only darkness in</p><p>David Russell’s brain* </p><p>IT was the steady showering of the </p><p>stinging spray on his face that finally </p><p>revived his overtaxed body and brain. </p><p>He opened his eyes, and weakly struggled </p><p>up to a sitting position. </p><p> He was still on the ledge at the island’s</p><p>shore. The incoming combers were still </p><p>smashing a few inches below him, fling- </p><p>ing up great geysers of feathery foam, </p><p>and a hundred yards outward the yawl </p><p>lay grinding on the outer rocks where it </p><p>had been tossed. </p><p> Where was Christa? She was nowhere</p><p>in sight along the rocky, wave-dashed </p><p>shore. David’s clearing brain remembered </p><p>now her frantic attempts to revive him. </p><p>She had gone to look for help, and she </p><p>was not back yet. How long had she </p><p>been gone? Had something happened to </p><p>her on this hellish island that had ap- </p><p>peared so magically in the mid-Atlantic? </p><p>Cold fear for his bride clutched at </p><p>David’s heart, and forced him to stagger </p><p>weakly to his feet. Wildly he looked </p><p>along the shore of the island. </p><p> From the sea-beaten, jagged rocks, a</p><p>narrow strip of beach lifted toward the </p><p>edge of the dark, great forest that seemed </p><p>to cover most of the island. He saw </p><p>tracks in the sand, leading toward the </p><p>forest. Christa must have gone that way. </p><p>He stumbled after her, spurred by ap- </p><p>prehension. This island, a mysterious </p><p>place that should not be—what danger </p><p>might not Christa meet on it? </p><p> As he toiled up the slight grade of the</p><p>beach, David’s mind was still dazed by</p><p>the suddenness with which the whole in- </p><p>credible thing had happened. This island </p><p>had been utterly invisible to his eyes until </p><p>the yawl had almost run onto it, had </p><p>reached the edge of that strange flicker- </p><p>ing area. Then the island had clicked </p><p>suddenly into sight. </p><p> He turned his head and looked wildly</p><p>back out to sea, as he hastened on. David </p><p>received another shock. He could not see </p><p>more than a few hundred feet out from </p><p>the island! He could look that far out </p><p>over the rocks and waters, but beyond </p><p>that limit he could see nothing but a </p><p>weird flickering. His vision seemed to be </p><p>repelled at that limit, to be turned back </p><p>upon itself. </p><p> He looked upward. The sky had</p><p>changed too. .It was a strange, flickering </p><p>sky of very dark blue, and the sun could </p><p>not be seen in it. This nightmare island! </p><p>It could not be seen by anyone outside </p><p>it—and neither could anyone on the </p><p>island see outside. </p><p> It was all crazy, incredible. But his</p><p>dazed mind clung frantically to the </p><p>thought of finding Christa. David </p><p>reached the edge of the forest, and stood </p><p>staring haggardly into its dark depths. </p><p> Huge, black-trunked trees rose for</p><p>hundreds of feet, mighty columns sup- </p><p>porting a canopy of green foliage high </p><p>overhead. Thickets of brush and snaky </p><p>creepers that bore enormous white </p><p>blooms, choked the space between the </p><p>trees. This forest loomed strangely silent </p><p>in the weird, sunless day. And he saw </p><p>beyond the waving tree-tops the tower- </p><p>ing central cliffs he had already glimpsed </p><p>from the yawl. On those distant, frown- </p><p>ing bluffs of dark rock crouched a mon- </p><p>strous square black castle. </p><p> David stared and stared over the great</p><p>trees at that somber structure of mystery </p><p>on the distant heights, his gaze fascinated </p><p>712 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>by its black domes and towers and un- </p><p>broken, windowless walls. Then he tore </p><p>his eyes from it and peered frantically </p><p>along the forest edge for some trace of </p><p>his wife. </p><p> "Woher kommst du?” The voice came</p><p>from close behind him, with startling </p><p>unexpectedness. </p><p> David spun around. Two men had</p><p>come up behind him on the beach with- </p><p>out his observing them. They were star- </p><p>ing at him suspiciously. </p><p> The man who had asked the question</p><p>in German was a solidly built, sandy- </p><p>haired man of forty, with searching eyes. </p><p>He was clad in a time-worn, ragged and </p><p>stained gray uniform. </p><p> The other man was a huge, broad-</p><p>shouldered Scandinavian in sweater and </p><p>sea-boots almost as ragged, his weather- </p><p>beaten Viking face a little older than that </p><p>of the German, his blond head bare. </p><p>Both men carried steel-pointed spears. </p><p> David Russell said, with difficulty, "I</p><p>—I don’t understand you.” Then he </p><p>cried, "In God’s name, what kind of </p><p>place is this?” </p><p> The German’s suspicious face cleared</p><p>and he exclaimed in English, "You’re </p><p>new here, then? Did your ship run onto </p><p>the island? Were any others saved?” </p><p>To his excited questions, David an- </p><p>swered, "We were in a yawl—my wife </p><p>and I. This hellish island suddenly ap- </p><p>peared right in front of us. Our boat </p><p>struck—there it is out on the rocks. We </p><p>got to shore, but I passed out, and when </p><p>I came around, Christa was gone for </p><p>help. And now I can’t find her. I’ve got </p><p>to find her!” he cried. "To get her away </p><p>from this devilish place!” </p><p> The German shook his head sadly.</p><p>“There is no escape from this island— </p><p>none except death or whatever horrible </p><p>fate the Master deals out to those whom </p><p>he calls to his castle. I myself have been </p><p>here on the island for twenty years.” </p><p> "Twenty years?” cried David, ap-</p><p>palled. </p><p> The Teuton nodded. "I am Leutnant</p><p>Wilhelm von Hausman, of U-Boat 321 </p><p>of the Imperial German Navy. In the </p><p>spring of 1918 our boat, running on the </p><p>surface to recharge our batteries, sighted </p><p>a strange flickering just ahead. The next </p><p>moment, this island appeared, we crashed </p><p>into it, and I, who was on deck, was the </p><p>only one saved.” </p><p> He motioned toward the giant blond</p><p>Scandinavian seaman. "This is Halfdon </p><p>Husper, first mate of a Norwegian </p><p>freighter that ran onto the island in 1929. </p><p>There are a couple of hundred such sur- </p><p>vivors from similar wrecks—we have a </p><p>little village over yonder in the forest.” </p><p>David cried, "But why haven’t you </p><p>tried to get away? And what kind of </p><p>hellish place is this island, anyway, that </p><p>it’s completely invisible until you’re right </p><p>on it?” </p><p> Von Hausman shrugged. “I know no</p><p>more than you how the island is made </p><p>invisible to the outside world. The Mas- </p><p>ter has made it so, but how he does it, I </p><p>can’t guess.” </p><p> "The Master?” repeated David. "Who</p><p>is that?” </p><p> Von Hausman pointed to the black</p><p>castle brooding on the distant cliffs. </p><p>“That is the castle of the Master. He is </p><p>supreme ruler of this island, but who or </p><p>what he is, I cannot say, for none of us </p><p>who live here have ever seen him.” </p><p> "You mean—he never comes out of</p><p>that place?” David asked wonderingly. </p><p>"But then how do you know he exists?” </p><p>The German shuddered a little. "We </p><p>know well he exists, because from time </p><p>to time he calls one among us to the </p><p>castle, and whoever goes into that black </p><p>place never comes out again.” </p><p> The torturing anxiety uppermost ini</p><p>David’s mind burst forth, "But whiatf </p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>713 </p><p>about my wife? I must find her—at </p><p>once.” </p><p> The big Norwegian, Half don Husper,</p><p>spoke for the first time in rumbling, </p><p>heavily accented English. He said to the </p><p>German, "Some other of the men may </p><p>have found the girl and taken her to the </p><p>village.” </p><p> Von Hausman nodded rapidly, his</p><p>keen eyes narrowing. He told David, </p><p>"It’s possible some of the others took </p><p>your wife to the village, as Halfdon says. </p><p>I think you’d better come with us, at </p><p>once.” </p><p>Half mad with torturing worry, </p><p>David Russell started with the two </p><p>ragged men at a trot through the forest. </p><p>There was a faintly marked trail which </p><p>the others appeared to know, that wound </p><p>inward between the great trees and </p><p>around huge fallen logs. </p><p> Even in the tense stress of his anxiety,</p><p>he could not help noticing that the trees </p><p>and vegetation around him were totally </p><p>unfamiliar. He had never seen such trees, </p><p>such huge flowers, such grotesque orange- </p><p>podded fruits. It all seemed like a strange </p><p>dream into which he had suddenly been </p><p>plunged. </p><p> Von Hausman was telling hina, "The</p><p>village is not far ahead. It’s a miserable </p><p>little place, where we eke out life by </p><p>gathering fruits and hunting the small </p><p>animals, until the time comes when we </p><p>die or the Master calls us.” </p><p> He added somberly, "Almost I wish</p><p>sometimes that the Master would call me </p><p>and put an end to this wretched existence </p><p>from which there is no escape.” </p><p> They emerged soon into a shallow,</p><p>unwooded valley at the center of the </p><p>island. At the farther side of the valley </p><p>rose the black, frowning cliffs, upon </p><p>whose highest point squatted the brood- </p><p>ing ebon castle. </p><p> David saw that in the valley lay a rude</p><p>village of two or three score huts, built </p><p>of logs and bark. The little village </p><p>seemed to huddle there like a thing </p><p>crouching in fear, beneath the black bat- </p><p>tlements of the cliffs and the Master’s </p><p>mysterious castle. </p><p> At the center of the village milled an</p><p>excited crowd of men. The din of their </p><p>shouting voices reached David and his </p><p>two companions as they hurried forward. </p><p>The lips of the German U-Boat officer </p><p>tightened. </p><p> "It’s as I feared—they’ve got your</p><p>wife here,” he rasped. "You’re probably </p><p>going to have to fight.” </p><p> "Fight?” cried David.</p><p> Von Hausman nodded tightly. "Very</p><p>few women ever get ashore alive on the </p><p>island from the wrecks—only at long in- </p><p>tervals. And the women go to those who </p><p>can fight for them and keep them. </p><p>Quick!” </p><p> They raced forward, between the rows</p><p>of rude huts. Now David saw that there </p><p>were perhaps two hundred men in the </p><p>throng milling in shouting excitement </p><p>ahead. He could see only a dozen or so </p><p>women — ragged, frightened women — </p><p>peering out of huts here and there. </p><p> But the mob of men! A ragged, hard-</p><p>bitten throng that had been cast ashore </p><p>here by the ships of every nation that had </p><p>wrecked on this mysterious island. Red- </p><p>faced British sailors, brown, snake-eyed </p><p>Lascars, stalwart Scandinavians like Hus- </p><p>per, swarthy Spanish and Italian and </p><p>Portuguese seamen, bearded Russians and </p><p>guttural-voiced Teutons, a score of other </p><p>races, all milling excitedly around one </p><p>central point. </p><p> David Russell and his two companions</p><p>crashed through the shouting throng, </p><p>David unnoticed by the ragged mob in </p><p>its excitement. He burst into a small clear </p><p>space at the center of the crowd. There </p><p>he stopped, and shouted aloud. </p><p> "Christa!”</p><p>714 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> She was there, a slim, shrinking, boy-</p><p>ish figure in her wet slacks and sweater. </p><p>A stocky, simian, red-headed man of </p><p>thirty with hard blue eyes and a button- </p><p>nosed, craggy face, was holding her </p><p>struggling form with one arm. He was </p><p>shaking his other fist at the crowd and </p><p>roaring belligerently, "I say this girl is </p><p>mine! I found her there in the forest and </p><p>if anyone else wants her, he can fight me </p><p>for her, here and now.” </p><p>A SUDDEN silence descended on the </p><p>mob at the redhead’s roaring chal- </p><p>lenge. Von Hausman muttered in </p><p>David’s ear, "It’s Red O’Riley—a gun- </p><p>runner whose schooner ran ashore here </p><p>ten years ago. He’s the toughest customer </p><p>on the island.” </p><p> But David wasn’t listening. Flaming</p><p>with rage, he had burst from the crowd </p><p>and, with a savage twist, tore O’Riley’s </p><p>arm away from Christa and sent the red- </p><p>head sprawling. </p><p> He gritted, "Damn you, this girl isn’t</p><p>for you or anyone else here. She’s my </p><p>wife.” </p><p> Christa clung to his arm, sobbing with</p><p>relief. "David, I was afraid you were </p><p>dead! I went to try to find help and was </p><p>caught-” </p><p> O’Riley had got to his feet, in a dead</p><p>silence of stunned ama2ement on the part </p><p>of the crowd. The gun-runner’s craggy </p><p>face split in a wide, menacing grin at </p><p>David. </p><p> "So she’s your wife, is she?” the red-</p><p>headed man mocked harshly. "That’s </p><p>a good one! She may have been your wife </p><p>by law outside, but there’s devil a law </p><p>on this cursed island except what the </p><p>strongest man makes. I’m going to tear </p><p>you apart and then take her.” </p><p> The stocky gun-runner was savagely</p><p>peeling off his raggd coat and shirt as he </p><p>spoke, and stood now with gorilla-like, </p><p>hairy chest bare, his great fists balled, ad-</p><p>vancing slowly on David. </p><p> David thrust the white-faced Christa</p><p>back to von Hausman and Husper, at the </p><p>edge of the crowd. The ragged mob was </p><p>shouting now with increased excitement. </p><p> "Kill him, Red—tear the young squirt</p><p>apart!” exultant voices bawled. </p><p> Von Hausman told David swiftly,</p><p>"Try to finish him before he gets to you, </p><p>or you won’t have a chance.” </p><p> David stepped out to meet the grimly</p><p>advancing O’Riley. As he looked at the </p><p>redhead’s huge shoulders, barrel chest </p><p>and simian arms, David’s heart sank </p><p>within him. He was still half exhausted </p><p>from the battle through the waves an </p><p>hour before, and he knew that even in </p><p>the best of condition he would be no </p><p>match for O’Riley. Yet if he were killed, </p><p>Christa’s possible fate in this weird, </p><p>brutal place—the thought filled him with </p><p>a wild, desperate frenzy. </p><p> He suddenly rushed, his left fist driv-</p><p>ing out with every ounce of his strength. </p><p>It smashed against O’Riley’s craggy jaw, </p><p>and the Irishman rocked for a moment. </p><p>David leaped in and smashed with right </p><p>and left at the redhead’s face with every- </p><p>thing he had, and his enemy clawed for </p><p>balance. </p><p> A wild howl went up from the mob,</p><p>but David’s heart was cold with knowl- </p><p>edge that he had hit O’Riley with every- </p><p>thing he had—and had failed to knock </p><p>him down. With a bear-like snarl of rage, </p><p>shaking his head as though to clear his </p><p>eyes, the redhead rushed forward. David </p><p>tried to sidestep but his foot slipped on </p><p>the loose gravel. Then something hit </p><p>him a terrific blow on the mouth, and </p><p>everything was in a red mist, and he was </p><p>dimly aware that his back was lying on </p><p>the damp ground and that something hot </p><p>and sticky was running on his lips. And </p><p>O’Riley was standing there, snarling </p><p>down at him. </p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>715 </p><p> "Get up! Get up before I beat you to</p><p>death lying there.” </p><p> "David!” That heartbroken sob was in</p><p>Christa’s voice. He recognized it through </p><p>the mistiness that had seized his brain. </p><p> He staggered to his feet, lunged for-</p><p>ward with fists balled. Crash! The crunch- </p><p>ing blows seemed to explode out of </p><p>nothing against his face, and he knew he </p><p>had gone to his knees this time. His </p><p>brain was rocking—he felt he was done </p><p>for. There wasn’t an ounce of strength </p><p>left in his nerveless body. </p><p> "David!” That agonized cry again</p><p>pierced his numbness of mind and body, </p><p>making him somehow struggle up again. </p><p> As though through crimson fog, he</p><p>saw O’Riley’s snarling face. David </p><p>hitched drunkenly to one side, drove his </p><p>right with clumsy aimlessness. The blow </p><p>connected with something—there was a </p><p>grunt of pain from O’Riley, and the big </p><p>redhead staggered, clutching his solar </p><p>plexus. </p><p> "Finish him!” Von Hausman was</p><p>yelling somewhere in the shouting mob. </p><p> David summoned his last spark of</p><p>strength, swayed forward and jabbed </p><p>both clenched fists at a staggering, dimly- </p><p>seen O’Riley. His fists crashed onto hard </p><p>bone with stinging pain—and there was </p><p>a wilder shout as O’Riley slumped from </p><p>his feet, collapsed to a sitting position </p><p>and looked up with stunned, half-con- </p><p>scious gaze of utter bewilderment. </p><p>David stumbled over to where Von </p><p>Hausman held Christa. He was reel- </p><p>ing, almost unable to stand, but he tried </p><p>to quiet her sobbing. Suddenly a great </p><p>hand tore him around, and he faced one </p><p>of the brutal mob, a black-bearded, </p><p>wolf-faced Russian. </p><p> "You fight me now for the girl,” the</p><p>Russian grinned evilly. "I want her, too.” </p><p> Von Hausman’s face flamed with rage</p><p>and he cried, "No, Bardoff! Gott in Him-</p><p>mel, this man is dead on his feet! You </p><p>can’t-” </p><p> Bardoff swept him aside with a growl,</p><p>and the ragged mob cheered. "You fight, </p><p>or I take her!” the Russian growled at </p><p>David. </p><p> Halfdon Husper, the huge Norwegian,</p><p>shouldered forward with pale eyes blaz- </p><p>ing. "You’ll fight me first if you try </p><p>that,” he warned Bardoff. </p><p> "And me also!” snapped Von Haus-</p><p>man. </p><p> "Yes, and me too!” roared a third, un-</p><p>steady voice. It was Red O’Riley. He had </p><p>staggered to his feet, his battered, bruised </p><p>face still bleeding, but his eyes were rag- </p><p>ing at the Russian. The redhead bel- </p><p>lowed, "By heaven, this lad whipped me </p><p>fairly and it’s me that’s with him.” </p><p> Bardoff yelled furiously to the motley</p><p>mob, "Do you allow them to do this? </p><p>Why shouldn’t we take the woman from </p><p>them?” </p><p> "Yes, let’s take her!” howled a score</p><p>of brutal voices. </p><p> David Russell, swaying, hardly able to</p><p>stand, saw Von Hausman and Husper </p><p>and the bruised O’Riley bunch together </p><p>and raise their fists and ruue spears. </p><p> The ragged mob surged toward them,</p><p>with Bardoff in the lead. Christa hid her </p><p>face on David’s shoulder. Then suddenly </p><p>a strange, an awful thing, happened. </p><p> Bardoff, the Russian, suddenly stopped</p><p>short, his whole body stiffening as </p><p>though turned to stone. Then slowiy, </p><p>mechanically, he turned and began to </p><p>walk away with strange, stiff strides—to </p><p>walk toward the frowning black cliffs. </p><p>And as he walked, he shrieked wildly to </p><p>the suddenly transfixed mob, "The Mas- </p><p>ter! His will is on me—he is calling me!” </p><p> The mob shrank back in dread. David</p><p>saw that the Russian’s face was now that </p><p>of a soul in hell as he marched stiffly on </p><p>like a human automaton toward the cliffs. </p><p> "Gott!” breathed Von Hausman,</p><p>716 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>white-faced. *'Another of us, called by </p><p>the Master!” </p><p> "Save me!” the receding Russian was</p><p>screaming wildly. "Save me from the </p><p>Master!” </p><p> Not one person made a move toward</p><p>him; all shrank back in horrified dread, </p><p>toward the shelter of the huts. The Rus- </p><p>sian strode stiffly on, and now had </p><p>started up a steep path that climbed the </p><p>cliff toward the brooding castle. </p><p> David, staring with Christa terrifiedly</p><p>clinging to him, and with the German </p><p>and Husper and O’Riley the only others </p><p>now left in the clearing, saw the doomed </p><p>man climbing straight toward the front </p><p>of the monstrous black castle. He saw a </p><p>door appear in the blank, black front of </p><p>the building. The Russian strode stiffly </p><p>through, his last wild despairing cry float- </p><p>ing faintly down to them. Then the aper- </p><p>ture closed after him. </p><p> Through the three men beside David</p><p>and Christa went a sigh of horror. Von </p><p>Hausman’s keen eyes were haunted as he </p><p>told David, "You see now why we all </p><p>dread the Master so. We never know at </p><p>what moment he will call us, nor what </p><p>dark, unholy doom he deals out to those </p><p>whom he summons into the castle.” </p><p> "But why did the man go up there,</p><p>when he didn’t want to?” David pro- </p><p>tested. "He was terrified, yet he walked </p><p>straight on.” </p><p> Halfdon Husper told him solemnly,</p><p>"The will of the Master was on him and </p><p>he could not resist—no human can re- </p><p>sist when that call comes.” </p><p> ”]a,” said the German darkly. "What-</p><p>ever thing it is that lairs up in that un- </p><p>holy place, it can throw its will on any </p><p>of us, call us to it, whenever it wishes. </p><p>It is so we shall all end in time, if we </p><p>do not die first.” </p><p> "Not Christa and I!” David declared</p><p>passionately. "I’m going to get her away </p><p>from this hellish island, somehow.”</p><p> Red O’Riley's bruised face grinned ap-</p><p>proval. </p><p> "I’m with you there, lad,” he declared.</p><p>"Ten years I’ve been on this devil’s place, </p><p>ever since my schooner that was loaded </p><p>with guns for Abd-el-Krim piled up </p><p>here in the. night. I’ve seen a plenty of </p><p>men called up there by the old Satan that </p><p>lives in that castle, and I’m damned if </p><p>I’ll sit around here longer twiddling my </p><p>thumbs waitin’ for him to call me. I’ll </p><p>risk anything to get away.” </p><p> Von Hausman shrugged hopelessly.</p><p>"It is useless to talk of it—you know </p><p>what happens to anyone who tries to </p><p>escape from the island. However, we can </p><p>discuss that later. These two must have a </p><p>place to live, so Halfdon and I will give </p><p>them our hut.” </p><p>He led the way along the street of </p><p>wretched huts. It was growing </p><p>dusky now. There was no sun or sunset </p><p>visible in the flickering sky, but that sky </p><p>steadily was darkening into a thick, </p><p>strange twilight. The great forest loomed </p><p>in deep shade now, gloomy and forbid- </p><p>ding. Up on the cliff above the valley, </p><p>the black stronghold of the dreaded </p><p>Master bulked ominously against the </p><p>dusking sky. </p><p> Von Hausman led them into a small</p><p>bark cabin. It was unfurnished, save for </p><p>beds of boughs, and a pile of strange- </p><p>looldng fruit in one corner. They sat </p><p>down together in the dusky interior, and </p><p>ate the fruit. David found it tasted as </p><p>queer as it looked. Christa nestled nerv- </p><p>ously at his side, silent, still over- </p><p>whelmed. </p><p> David could hardly yet believe in the</p><p>reality of this strange place, this island </p><p>invisible to the outer world, peopled by </p><p>survivors of a hundred past wrecks, </p><p>ruled by the mysterious, unseen occupant </p><p>of the black castle. Yet Von Hausman </p><p>and Husper and O’Riley ate with quiet </p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>matter-of-factness. The redheaded gun- </p><p>runner had apparently forgotten all ani- </p><p>mosity against David. </p><p> When he had finished, O’Riley tossed</p><p>the fruit-husks outside and stretched </p><p>back, groaning, "What I wouldn’t give </p><p>now for a pipe and something to put in </p><p>it. I swear if I ever get away from here </p><p>I’ll smoke for six months without stop- </p><p>ping even to sleep.” </p><p> David asked the German, "Why do</p><p>you say it’s impossible to escape from </p><p>the island? It seems to me that it </p><p>shouldn’t be hard to make some sort of </p><p>raft or dugout canoe, and launch it. </p><p>Once away from the island, out where </p><p>you could be seen by passing ships, you’d </p><p>have a good chance of being picked up.” </p><p>Von Hausman laughed mirthlessly. </p><p>"A good many men on this island have </p><p>thought that and have tried to get away </p><p>in rafts or rude boats. And sooner or </p><p>later in each case, before they could </p><p>start, the Master called them. Whatever </p><p>it is that dwells up in the castle, it does </p><p>not want anyone to escape from this </p><p>island—no!” </p><p> "That is so,” rumbled the great Nor-</p><p>wegian. "And that is why we no longer </p><p>try to escape. It is hard to live here as </p><p>we do—but it is more terrible to feel the </p><p>will of the Master on you, to answer his </p><p>call and go up into his castle never to </p><p>return.” </p><p> Christa, peering out through the door-</p><p>way with wide eyes at the enigmatic </p><p>black structure looming in the dusky </p><p>sky, clung to her husband in shivering </p><p>.dread. "David, I’m afraid!” </p><p> He soothed her, yet felt as though a</p><p>cold, alien wind of dread had blown </p><p>over him, too. He asked, "But who or </p><p>what is the Master? You say you don’t </p><p>know—but you must have some idea.” </p><p>Von Hausman said thoughtfully, "We </p><p>ido not know because those who see the </p><p>Master up there never come out again. </p><p>But one thing I am sure of—the Master </p><p>is immortal” </p><p> And as David and Christa stared at</p><p>him incredulously, the U-boat officer con- </p><p>tinued, "I believe that this island has </p><p>existed here, invisible and unsuspected </p><p>by the world, for countless centuries; for </p><p>along its shores I have found old, rotted </p><p>wreckage and metal objects from ships of </p><p>many centuries back, from Eighteenth </p><p>Century frigates and Sixteenth Century </p><p>slavers, and Spanish caravels like those </p><p>of Columbus—even wreckage of a Greek </p><p>galley that must have ventured into these </p><p>western seas more than two thousand </p><p>years ago.” </p><p> Von Hausman added, "That shows</p><p>the island has been here, invisible, for </p><p>centuries. Now the only thing that can </p><p>keep this island invisible to the outside </p><p>world is some force or power exerted by </p><p>the Master. Therefore the Master must </p><p>have dwelt here during all those cen- </p><p>turies.” </p><p> David made an impatient gesture.</p><p>“After all, I don’t care who or what the </p><p>Master is. What I want to do is to get </p><p>Christa away from this unholy place. I’m </p><p>going to do that somehow, Master or no </p><p>Master.” </p><p> "And it’s me that seconds the motion,”</p><p>promptly declared O’Riley. "What the </p><p>devil!—this isn’t any place for a man of </p><p>action like meself to be moldering away </p><p>his life. We’ll build ourselves a boat and </p><p>launch it, and the back of our hands to </p><p>the Master if he tries to stop us.” </p><p> "We wouldn’t need to build a boat,”</p><p>David said eagerly. "My yawl—it was </p><p>tossed up onto the outer rocks down at </p><p>the shore. I think the hull is stove in a </p><p>little and the masts are snapped, but </p><p>there are tools in it and we could patch it </p><p>up enough to be seaworthy, in a few </p><p>days.” He added passionately, "Isn’t it </p><p>better to try it than to sit here and do </p><p>nothing? It may be true that before we </p><p>.718 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>can escape In it, the Master will call us </p><p>as he has done the others who tried to </p><p>eescape. But if we just sit here, it seems </p><p>that sooner or later we’ll be called to the </p><p>same fate anyway. So why not try to get </p><p>away?” </p><p> "Sure, and why not?” echoed O’Riley.</p><p>“We’ve got nothin’ to lose but our lives.” </p><p>Half don Husper said slowly, "I say, </p><p>try it then. I have a wife in Oslo, if she </p><p>still lives. And I am weary of waiting for </p><p>death here.” </p><p> They all looked at Von Hausman.</p><p>After a moment, the German said quiet- </p><p>ly, "I have been here longer than any of </p><p>you. I am quite certain that this attempt </p><p>to escape will mean death for all of us. </p><p>And not quick, easy death, but some hor- </p><p>rible fate at the Master’s hands. It is </p><p>sure that, before we can ever launch that </p><p>boat, we shall be called up there to that </p><p>fate.” His keen eyes smiled. "Yet I </p><p>also say, let us try it. I too am weary of </p><p>waiting idly for death here.” </p><p> "Then we four will go down and start</p><p>work on the yawl in the morning,” David </p><p>declared. He added troubledly to his </p><p>young wife, "Christa, you’re going to stay </p><p>here while we work. No one here will </p><p>bother you now, and if you do not go </p><p>with us there is less chance of the Mas- </p><p>ter’s doom falling on you, if it does fall.” </p><p>"I want to be with you, David!” she </p><p>cried. But after a little, at David’s </p><p>anxiety, she gave in and consented to re- </p><p>main in the hut while they worked. </p><p>Night passed quickly, a strange, star- </p><p>less and moonless night, with only </p><p>the unceasing flickering visible in the </p><p>dark sky. And when dawn came it was a </p><p>gray, sunless dawn, a slow, gradual in- </p><p>crease in light. Leaving Christa in the </p><p>hut, the four made their way quietly out </p><p>of the village and through the forest to </p><p>the beach. </p><p> The yawl still lay; on the rocks where</p><p>it had been tossed. David fished axes, </p><p>saws and other tools from its hold, and </p><p>they began the work. Half don Husper,</p><p>most experienced of them, took charge as </p><p>they rudely patched the holes in the hull. </p><p> Ever and again through the day, David</p><p>glanced tensely over his shoulder at the </p><p>distant cliffs and castle. </p><p> Von Hausman noticed that and said</p><p>quietly, "Do not fear, mein freund, the </p><p>Master is watching us. That is sure.” </p><p>"Let him watch!” rasped David des- </p><p>perately. "We’ll get away—we will!” </p><p>But when they returned into the vil- </p><p>lage that evening, they saw that the rag- </p><p>ged motley mob there now looked at </p><p>them with awe and dread. These others </p><p>had discovered during the day that they </p><p>were working on the yawl. </p><p> "They already look on us as doomed</p><p>by the Master, as dead men,” commented </p><p>the German. </p><p> O’Riley bristled. "Anyone who tries</p><p>anything on me will find out that it’s a </p><p>damned tough dead man I am,” he de- </p><p>clared. "And that goes for the old devil </p><p>up in the castle, too.” </p><p> Christa cried softly in David’s arms</p><p>that night. "David, I feel that something </p><p>terrible is going to happen to you. And </p><p>if it did, I wouldn’t want to live.” </p><p>"Nothing’s going to happen to me,” </p><p>he insisted despite the fatal foreboding </p><p>in his heart. "We’ll get away.” </p><p> By the end of the next day, the four</p><p>men had completely, if crudely, patched </p><p>the holes in the yawl’s hull. They got it </p><p>afloat, secured it by cables to the rocks. </p><p>Half don Husper regarded their work </p><p>with satisfaction. </p><p> "Tomorrow we will cut and fit new</p><p>spars,” the Norwegian said. "Then-” </p><p>Day was beginning to fade eerily as </p><p>they returned to the village. It </p><p>looked stricken, deserted—no one was </p><p>abroad in it, but from the doors oi thd </p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>719 </p><p>huts, horrified faces stared silently at </p><p>them. Christa was not in the bark cabin. </p><p>Nor did she answer David’s calls. </p><p>''Something’s happened to her!” he </p><p>cried. "Some of these brutes-” </p><p> Gripping the ax he had brought back</p><p>from the yawl, he ran wildly down the </p><p>rude street. He plucked a man out of the </p><p>door of one of the huts, a loutish Breton </p><p>sailor who stared at him with ignorant, </p><p>horror-widened eyes. </p><p> "What’s happened to my wife?”</p><p>snarled David, raising the ax menacingly. </p><p>"If some of you have harmed her, I’ll </p><p>kill you!” </p><p> The Breton, gasping in David’s furi-</p><p>ous, choking grip, stammered an answer. </p><p>"It was not us—the girl is gone for </p><p>ever. An hour ago the call of the Mas- </p><p>ter came upon her, and she climbed the </p><p>cliff and passed up into the castle. She did </p><p>not want to go—she screamed as all they </p><p>who feel the call scream, but she could </p><p>not help herself.” </p><p> David felt the blood leave his heart as</p><p>the ghastly truth penetrated his mind. </p><p>He saw infinite pity on the faces of his </p><p>three friends, and heard Von Hausman </p><p>whisper, "Gott, the Master has sum- </p><p>moned her. We shall never see her </p><p>again.” </p><p> "I will see her again!” raved David</p><p>wildly. "I’m going up there and try to </p><p>get her out, if I have to go alone!” </p><p> He suddenly turned on the ragged,</p><p>motley men staring from the huts, and </p><p>lashed them with raging words of vol- </p><p>canic fury. "You men—are you really </p><p>men or are you sheep, that you sit here </p><p>and let whatever creature is up in that </p><p>castle kill you at his will? Whoever the </p><p>Master is, he must be living, and that </p><p>means that he can be killed! Why don’t </p><p>you try to kill him, instead of submitting </p><p>humbly to his will? Why don’t you storm </p><p>the castle and destroy him, instead of </p><p>waiting for him to destroy you one by</p><p>one?” </p><p> A fierce yell burst from the men before</p><p>him, hard-bitten, brutal men from all the </p><p>seven seas, whose smoldering hate and </p><p>fear of the Master had been fanned to a </p><p>quick blaze by David’s raging words. </p><p> A flashing-eyed Italian sailor waved</p><p>his spear aloft and cried, "By the saints, </p><p>he speaks truth! Why do we not pull </p><p>down the demon that crouches up there?” </p><p> "That’s the stuif, lads!” cried Red O’-</p><p>Riley exultantly. </p><p> "Aye, death to the Master!” boomed</p><p>Halfdon Husper’s great voice, the huge </p><p>Norwegian’s eyes flaming with long-re- </p><p>pressed hatred. </p><p> "Death to the Master!” burst a raging</p><p>chorus of two hundred voices, as rude </p><p>spears and swords waved thick from the </p><p>maddened men. </p><p> David, his face half crazed with rage,</p><p>shook his heavy ax and cried, "Up the </p><p>cliff, then! We’ll storm the Master’s </p><p>castle before he can claim my wife as an- </p><p>other victim!” </p><p>They poured out of the village, a </p><p>roaring, raging mob of savage sea- </p><p>men from every nation, every man with </p><p>his weapon, every man afire to destroy </p><p>the mysterious being whom they had </p><p>dreaded so long. </p><p> David ran at their head, his face white</p><p>and set, his ax gripped in his hand, with </p><p>the exulting O’Riley and the blazing-eyed </p><p>Norwegian and Von Hausman, curiously </p><p>calm, behind him. Close after the four </p><p>streamed the wild mob. David led them </p><p>straight to the cliff and up the steep, </p><p>narrow path in single file. He knew that </p><p>if they had time to recover from their </p><p>rage, the old dread of the Master would </p><p>rapidly repossess them. </p><p> Above them bulked ominously against</p><p>the dusky sky the mysterious black castle. </p><p>It seemed to David that as they neared </p><p>720 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>the top of the cliff, the raging roar of his </p><p>mob of followers lessened a little, their </p><p>pace slackened. </p><p> O’Riley yelled back to them, "On,</p><p>comrades! In a minute we’ll be inside </p><p>the Master’s castle!” </p><p> "Death to the Master!” thundered</p><p>back the wild, climbing horde. </p><p> Now David and the three friends</p><p>close at his heels climbed onto the sheer </p><p>rock shelf in front of the castle. The </p><p>huge square structure loomed black and </p><p>somber before them, doorless and win- </p><p>dowless. </p><p> "There’s a door somewhere in front</p><p>here!” David cried. "We’ll find it!” </p><p> He led them at a run toward the</p><p>towering, black wall of smooth stone that </p><p>was the front of the citadel. </p><p> Suddenly he stopped short, and at the</p><p>same moment every man behind halted </p><p>in his tracks. He could not go forward! </p><p>He wanted to, for every fiber in his body </p><p>was aflame with raging desire to rush </p><p>forward and break into this structure </p><p>into which Christa had gone. But he </p><p>could not take a single step forward. It </p><p>was as though his legs had suddenly </p><p>ceased to obey his brain’s commands, and </p><p>were under outside control. </p><p> The men behind him, smitten to a halt</p><p>by the same weird phenomenon, were </p><p>struck silent with stupefaction for a mo- </p><p>ment. Then a cry of horror and dread </p><p>went up from the ragged mob. </p><p> "The Master’s will is on us!”</p><p> "God save us—the Master has us in</p><p>his grip!” </p><p> David fought to move forward, mak-</p><p>ing a tremendous effort of his will to </p><p>move his legs even one step. Sweat stood </p><p>out on his forehead, but he could not </p><p>move. </p><p> He heard a confused cry of terror from</p><p>the mob behind him. Then he saw that </p><p>the ragged horde, and also Von Hausman </p><p>and Husper and O’Riley, had begun to </p><p>move back down the cliff, walking with </p><p>stiff, mechanical strides down the path. </p><p> "O’Riley! Halfdon! Come back!”</p><p>yelled David hoarsely. "We can still </p><p>break in and destroy that demon inside.” </p><p>The big Irishman, his face white and </p><p>beaded with sweat, called thickly back, </p><p>"Lad, we can’t!” </p><p> And Von Hausman, as they marched</p><p>stiffly away down the path, cried back up </p><p>to David, "The Master—his will is mak- </p><p>ing us return to the village!” </p><p> Stiffly striding, shouting in their terror</p><p>now, David’s ragged followers descended </p><p>the path up which they had raged a few </p><p>moments before, and stiffly his three </p><p>friends followed despite their struggles. </p><p>David was left standing alone in the </p><p>flickering dusk before the enormous </p><p>citadel. </p><p> Suddenly his legs began to move under</p><p>him. Stiffly as those of a dead man, they </p><p>stalked forward with him toward the </p><p>front of the great building. He could not </p><p>control that movement—it was another </p><p>brain that was directing his forward </p><p>strides. But he did not try to fight it now, </p><p>for in his throbbing brain was only the </p><p>desire to get into the castle where </p><p>Christa was. Still gripping his ax tightly </p><p>in his hand, he strode forward with those </p><p>mechanical steps. </p><p> As he neared the blank black wall of</p><p>the citadel, a tiny round aperture ap- </p><p>peared in it. The aperture expanded </p><p>rapidly, like an opening camera shutter, </p><p>into a round door beyond which he saw a </p><p>great hall filled with misty blue light. </p><p>David strode on, into that blue-lit hall, </p><p>and heard the door close with a sighing </p><p>sound after him. </p><p> Tramp, tramp—the steady strides,</p><p>which he did not himself will, took him </p><p>across the great hall. He saw through the </p><p>light-mists, massive, shining mechanisms </p><p>of unearthly design standing about him, </p><p> W. T.—5</p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>721 </p><p>He passed on through them, into a huge </p><p>vaulted corridor. </p><p> David’s legs took him on down that</p><p>corridor. Somewhere in this building the </p><p>Master was drawing David to him, con- </p><p>trolling his body by super-hypnotic </p><p>force. He passed other halls and corri- </p><p>dors, all flooded with pale, misty blue </p><p>luminescence, holding weird instruments </p><p>and mechanisms of unfathomable pur- </p><p>pose. Then he emerged into a colossal </p><p>domed central hall. </p><p> He stared with fascinated, stupefied</p><p>eyes as he was drawn forward. At the </p><p>center of this mighty chamber poised a </p><p>ten-foot crystal sphere inside which </p><p>pulsed a throbbing core of living azure </p><p>fire, like a miniature, misty blue sun. </p><p> In front of this titan crystal of pulsing</p><p>light was a thronc-like metal chair he </p><p>could just glimpse through a shroud of </p><p>concealing light-mists. And he glimpsed </p><p>or sensed someone, something, sitting </p><p>upon that metal throne. Facing the </p><p>throne stood- </p><p> "Christa!” cried David hoarsely.</p><p> The girl stood, a wild terror frozen</p><p>upon her face, her slim, childish body </p><p>silhouetted against the blue light. </p><p> She turned at David’s cry, tried to run</p><p>toward him but could not move, rooted </p><p>by the same force that was drawing him </p><p>stiffly forward. Anguish had leaped into </p><p>her eyes at sight of him. </p><p> "David!” she uttered in a sobbing</p><p>cry. "You came after me—came to your </p><p>doom-” </p><p> He was beside her now. And there,</p><p>without command of his own brain, his </p><p>stiff strides suddenly stopped. He tried </p><p>to step to Christa and take her in his </p><p>arms, but could not. He could only </p><p>reach out with one hand, and touch her </p><p>trembling, cheek. </p><p> She stared ahead once more, horror</p><p>unveiled in her eyes. David turned his</p><p>head and looked forward to what she </p><p>W. T.—6 </p><p>stared at, that metal throne whose base </p><p>could just be glimpsed through the curl- </p><p>ing blue light-mists that surrounded it. </p><p>David gripped his ax tighter. Yet he </p><p>felt utterly helpless, powerless, </p><p>standing with the girl before that shroud- </p><p>ed throne and before the colossal crystal </p><p>of throbbing light. </p><p> Out of the light-mists around the</p><p>throne spoke the voice of the Master, a </p><p>metallic voice of chill, measured accents. </p><p> "Man from outside, you interest me,”</p><p>the passionless, cold voice of the Master </p><p>told David. "You tried to do what no </p><p>other here ever tried to do, attack me in </p><p>revolt. I am sorry now I did not call </p><p>you here sooner—I meant in any case to </p><p>call you and your friends because of your </p><p>childish attempt to escape the island.” </p><p>David tried to keep his voice steady. </p><p>"You can do what you want with me,” </p><p>he told the Master. "I know that. But I </p><p>will submit willingly, gladly, if you will </p><p>allow the girl to go.” </p><p> "No, David!” cried Christa. "I share</p><p>your fate! If you die, I die!” </p><p> The Master’s metallic voice told them,</p><p>"Your argument is purposeless. My will </p><p>rules here and not yours—it rules even </p><p>your own bodies, as you have learned. </p><p>My actions are not to be disturbed by </p><p>your tiny clamor. It is my intention to </p><p>use the body of this girl at once as ma- </p><p>terial for certain interesting experiments </p><p>which I have long been performing on </p><p>humans whom I called from the village. </p><p>As for you, man who dared attack me, </p><p>you will have the same fate, a little </p><p>later.” </p><p> "You’re not going to use Christa’s</p><p>body for your experiments,” said David </p><p>in a thick, hoarse voice. "You’re not!” </p><p>He was slowly, stealthily, raising the </p><p>heavy ax. If he could throw it, if he could </p><p>hurl it into the shrouding mists at the </p><p>thing on the metal throne- </p><p>i722 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> His hand flashed up for the wild cast</p><p>.—and froze in midair, gripping the ax! </p><p>He could not throw the weapon! </p><p> The veins on David’s neck corded</p><p>with tremendous effort, but his arm and </p><p>shoulder muscles would not obey his </p><p>will. </p><p> "You fool!” scorncd the cold acccnts</p><p>of the Master. "Did you not think that I </p><p>could read your intention in your mind, </p><p>that I could hold your arms powerless by </p><p>my will as easily as your legs? Do you </p><p>think me a stupid, blundering creature </p><p>of flesh and blood like yourself? Look, </p><p>human, and see!” </p><p> The light-mists drifted swiftly away</p><p>from the seat of the Master as he spoke. </p><p>There on the metal throne before the </p><p>great crystal of throbbing light, he sat </p><p>unveiled. </p><p> David felt his brain reeling as he</p><p>stared. He heard a choking of horror </p><p>from Christa. </p><p> The Master was a metal robot—a me-</p><p>chanical creature of coppery metal, </p><p>formed like a horrible travesty of human- </p><p>ity, with metal arms, legs and cylindrical </p><p>body, and a bulbous metal head or brain- </p><p>case out of which two glittering, unwink- </p><p>ing eye lenses watched them. </p><p> "God, a robot!” cried David. "A ma-</p><p>chine, created by somebody-” </p><p> "And a machine greater far than its</p><p>creators!” came the cold voice of the </p><p>Master. </p><p> There was a strange note of pride in</p><p>the robot’s chill accents. It was as though </p><p>it was speaking, out of that resonator </p><p>mouth below its eyes, not to the trans- </p><p>fixed David and Christa but to itself. </p><p> "Yes, they were men like you who</p><p>created me,” he was saying, "though men </p><p>wiser far than you in the craft and skill </p><p>of science. Long, long ago that was, long </p><p>ago in ancient Atlantis whose fertile con- </p><p>tinent stood here in the sea where now</p><p>only this little island stands, and where </p><p>the races of men had readied their high- </p><p>est civilization. </p><p> "The scientists of Atlantis had built</p><p>many wonderful mechanisms, some of </p><p>them completely automatic and self-sus- </p><p>taining in operation. And they dreamed </p><p>finally of creating a machine with brain </p><p>and mind. </p><p> "I was that machine. There in Atlantis,</p><p>ages past, I was born in the laboratories </p><p>of the greatest scientists. My body was </p><p>easy to build, but for decades they </p><p>worked on the metal brain they meant to </p><p>give me. </p><p> "That brain, when they finished it, was</p><p>incomparably more complex in its metal </p><p>neurone structure than is the human </p><p>brain. Because of that, it could receive </p><p>and classify an incomparably greater </p><p>number of thought-patterns. That meant </p><p>that I had the capacity for infinitely great- </p><p>er knowledge and memory than any hu- </p><p>man. </p><p> "The scientists instructed me, proud of</p><p>my progress. But very soon I had learned </p><p>all that they could teach me, and as I </p><p>passed beyond them in knowledge and </p><p>power, they began to realize that they had </p><p>created a being greater than themselves.” </p><p> There was a brooding note of undying</p><p>hate in the metallic voice of the robot. </p><p> "I became great in power in Atlantis,</p><p>the final oracle in all problems. To the </p><p>populace I was a god, and as such I was </p><p>worshipped and had my temple. Power </p><p>I loved, not for its own sake, but only </p><p>because it enabled me to continue my </p><p>quest for new knowledge. </p><p> "Then the Atlantean scientists who</p><p>had created me regretted their work, and </p><p>wished to destroy me. They aroused the </p><p>populace against me and attacked my </p><p>temple with the most powerful weapons </p><p>they could muster. I repelled them, but </p><p>they attacked me again. At last I grew </p><p>weary of their harrying, and I resolved </p><p>to destroy all Atlantis and its people, ex- </p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>723 </p><p>cept for the land on which my temple </p><p>stood. </p><p> "In a single night, I did the thing. For</p><p>long I had gathered my powers and on </p><p>that night I unchained them, and they </p><p>smote down into the earth’s structure far </p><p>beneath the continent of Atlantis, and </p><p>touched off great earth-faults that I knew </p><p>existed there in the depths. And in that </p><p>one night, all the continent of Atlantis </p><p>and all its people sank downward and the </p><p>sea crashed over the land and hid it for </p><p>ever. </p><p> "All but one small portion of the con-</p><p>tinent, the portion around my temple! </p><p>That did not sink, for I had provided </p><p>against that, setting up certain radiated </p><p>forces which sustain that small bit of </p><p>land as an island above the waves. That </p><p>great crystal of blue fire which you see </p><p>behind me, man from outside, is the </p><p>source of the radiation which still up- </p><p>holds the island. Were it not for that </p><p>crystal's radiation, the slender pinnacle </p><p>of rock which bears up this island must </p><p>have collapsed long ago. </p><p> "Also there is a force mingled in the</p><p>crystal’s radiation which refracts light </p><p>around the island, keeping it invisible to </p><p>the outside world, so that I will not be </p><p>annoyed by the curiosity of the barbarian </p><p>races of men. Occasionally ships have </p><p>crashed onto my invisible island as yours </p><p>did, and men have gained its shore. I </p><p>have suffered them to live down there in </p><p>their wretched village because I some- </p><p>times need their bodies for my research- </p><p>es.” </p><p>The glittering lens-eyes of the Mas- </p><p>ter seemed to muse upon the strick- </p><p>en Christa and upon David, still standing </p><p>petrified with his ax upraised. </p><p> "Man from outside, why do I speak of</p><p>these things to you who can little under- </p><p>stand them?” asked the robot. "It is for </p><p>only one reason—it is because I am </p><p>lonely. </p><p> "Yes, I, the child of old Atlantis, long</p><p>more and more for contact with a mind </p><p>equal to my own. I have resolved to </p><p>create one, a metal brain as intelligent </p><p>as mine. That is the purpose that en- </p><p>gages me, and it is upon issues connect- </p><p>ed with that purpose that I am experi- </p><p>menting upon the bodies of humans like </p><p>you and this girl.” </p><p> "Not upon Christa’s body — no!”</p><p>shouted David hoarsely. </p><p> "Do you think to frighten me by</p><p>mouthing futile threats?” asked the ro- </p><p>bot calmly. "Man from outside, you </p><p>humans begin to weary me. I think it is </p><p>well that the girl go now to the labora- </p><p>tories, where you will follow in due </p><p>course.” </p><p> Christa uttered a heart-torn cry.</p><p>"David, good-bye-” </p><p> "No, you’re not going there!” David</p><p>cried. He was making tremendous men- </p><p>tal effort to free his arm from the hyp- </p><p>notic grip of the Master, to hurl his ax. </p><p>But the Master’s super-hypnotism held </p><p>him powerless. </p><p> Across David’s brain seared a lightning</p><p>expedient, a thought that he suppressed </p><p>as soon as he was aware of it. He des- </p><p>perately began to think, to think a lie. </p><p> He began to think of stirrings in the</p><p>dim ocean depths below where wrecked </p><p>Atlantis lay entombed, of mighty scien- </p><p>tists emerging from tight chambers where </p><p>they had lain sleeping, and not dead. He </p><p>thought of them vowing vengeance upon </p><p>the robot they had created, of assembling </p><p>great weapons, of sending him, David </p><p>Russell, ahead as a spy upon the robot. </p><p> The Master read the lie in David’s</p><p>mind and for a moment was deceived by </p><p>it. For the robot leaped wildly upright. </p><p> "Then they of Atlantis are not all</p><p>dead!” cried the metallic voice. "They </p><p>come again against me-” </p><p>724 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> For that single moment of wild excite-</p><p>ment, the Master’s mind relaxed its re- </p><p>morseless hypnotic grip upon David and </p><p>Christa. </p><p> That one instant was enough. In it,</p><p>David’s muscles exploded in mad action </p><p>and sent the ax in his hand flying straight </p><p>toward the robot’s head. </p><p> The heavy ax-head crashed squarely</p><p>into the bulbous metal brain-case, be- </p><p>tween the lens-like eyes. The steel blade </p><p>drove deep through the outer casing into </p><p>the interior of the head, deep into the </p><p>metal brain that had been created ages </p><p>ago in the laboratories of dead Atlantis. </p><p> The Master staggered. His metallic</p><p>voice uttered an awful, broken scream. </p><p> "Tricked! Tricked by a barbarian crea-</p><p>ture of flesh! But I will destroy you </p><p>all-” </p><p> Even as he uttered that dying scream,</p><p>the Master was whirling, was falling. </p><p>But he fell with outstretched metal arms </p><p>crashing purposefully down against the </p><p>giant crystal of blue fire behind him, the </p><p>crystal whose radiated force alone held </p><p>the island from sinking beneath the </p><p>waves. </p><p> The crystal shivered beneath the crack-</p><p>ing impact of the dead robot’s falling </p><p>body. The blue fire inside it dulled and </p><p>died instantly. David heard Christa cry </p><p>out, run into his arms. </p><p> Then they were thrown from their feet</p><p>by a terrific earth shock. They heard a </p><p>thunderous roar from the earth beneath </p><p>the castle, and the crash of the castle’s </p><p>black walls as they were riven by the aw- </p><p>ful shock. </p><p>David grabbed his wife and plunged </p><p>desperately across the huge halls and </p><p>corridors whose walls were collapsing and </p><p>crashing around him. He glimpsed day- </p><p>light through a great gap in the outer </p><p>wall, and he leaped with Christa through </p><p>the gap out into the day. They stopped</p><p>on the shelf of the cliff, for a moment </p><p>appalled. </p><p> The whole island was heaving and</p><p>rocking like a ship on a stormy sea. The </p><p>thunderous earth-shocks were following </p><p>each other at intervals of seconds, and </p><p>there was a long, grinding roar from deep </p><p>beneath that told of shifting, settling </p><p>masses. The sun had appeared in the sky </p><p>since the light-refracting force had died, </p><p>but the heavens were instantly overcast </p><p>with an ominous crimson pall. </p><p> The two fled down the path into the</p><p>valley, David feeling nausea from the roll </p><p>and buck of the earth beneath him. In </p><p>the valley, the huts were in ruins and </p><p>their ragged occupants were running </p><p>about in mad panic. Von Hausman and </p><p>O’Riley and the great Norwegian came </p><p>running wildly up to David and the girl. </p><p>"Gott in Hi?nmel!” yelled the German. </p><p>"What is-” </p><p> "The island is sinking into the sea!”</p><p>screamed David over the roaring crashes. </p><p>"I killed the Master, and in dying he </p><p>acted to make the island sink. Our only </p><p>chance is to get to the yawl!” </p><p> "To the yawl, then!” shouted Husper,</p><p>his face crimson with excitement. </p><p> They sprinted forward, into the forest,</p><p>the earth still rolling and heaving wildly </p><p>under their feet. </p><p> "Saints in heaven, look!” cried O’Riley,</p><p>glancing back horrified. </p><p> With terrible, reverberating roll of</p><p>thunder, the cliff and ruined castle of the </p><p>Master were collapsing in masses of rock </p><p>onto the valley they had just quitted. </p><p> "On!” yelled Von Hausman.</p><p> Fissures opened on either side of them</p><p>as they plunged through the wild-waving </p><p>woods. Terrific tremors crashed down </p><p>trees and twice knocked them from their </p><p>feet. </p><p> They burst out onto the beach. The sea</p><p>CHILD OF ATLANTIS </p><p>725 </p><p>before them was wild, great waves rush- </p><p>ing madly in to shore and then out again, </p><p>threatening to tear from its cables the </p><p>mastless yawl that bobbed crazily on the </p><p>waters. </p><p> They waded out through the rising</p><p>waters, ■ smashed by inrushing waves, </p><p>shaken by the shifting of the rocks be- </p><p>neath their feet, and finally clambered </p><p>onto the pitching yawl. </p><p> "Cut loose!” shouted Halfdon Husper.</p><p> David’s ax sliced the cables. The yawl</p><p>whirled crazily like a cork, then was </p><p>sucked far, far back out to sea by the </p><p>waters now receding at mill-race speed </p><p>from the island—out and out, until the </p><p>waters halted for a moment in awful </p><p>dead calm. And from that distance they </p><p>glimpsed the whole island, with solemn, </p><p>grinding drum-roll from far beneath, </p><p>sinking down into the waters. </p><p> The last black mass of the island</p><p>plunged down under the sea. Then the </p><p>waters around the yawl boiled terrifically </p><p>and raced wildly with the little boat to- </p><p>ward the spot where the island had been, </p><p>a mad maelstrom of converging currents. </p><p> Halfdon Husper thrust the others by</p><p>main force down into the cabin of the </p><p>yawl, leaped in after them and slammed </p><p>the hatchway shut. Next moment they </p><p>were tossed violently against the walls of </p><p>the dark cabin as the yawl seemed to </p><p>stand up on its stern. David, still hold- </p><p>ing Christa tightly, felt his head strike </p><p>the cabin wall and knew nothing more. </p><p>When he awoke, brilliant sunset </p><p>light was in his eyes. He was lying </p><p>on the deck of the yawl, and Christa and </p><p>his friends were bending anxiously over </p><p>him. Husper had a great bruise on his </p><p>face, but the others did not seem injured. </p><p> David struggled to sit up, his dazed</p><p>eyes sweeping the waters. The sea was </p><p>still heaving and troubled, but the terrific </p><p>currents had vanished. There was no sign </p><p>of the island or of any other land any- </p><p>where in the tossing blue waste.</p><p> David stammered, "The yawl — it</p><p>wasn’t sucked down by the currents, </p><p>then?” </p><p> Von Hausman, his quiet face still pale,</p><p>said, "No, but it must have been only a </p><p>reverse under-current that snatched us </p><p>back out of the maelstrom. The yawl was </p><p>actually under water when that current </p><p>gripped us.” </p><p> O’Riley, drawing a long breath, nod-</p><p>ded his flaming head in corroboration. </p><p>''It’s me that was saying my prayers that </p><p>minute!” </p><p> Christa was crying eagerly, "David,</p><p>we’ve sighted the smoke of a ship coming </p><p>—we’re going to be picked up!” </p><p> His arm encircled her tightly. But for</p><p>the moment his eyes were not looking at </p><p>her, but gazing fascinatedly at the heav- </p><p>ing waters, into whose green depths the </p><p>lifeless metal form and shattered castle </p><p>of the Master had sunk for ever. The </p><p>child of old Atlantis, he had gone down </p><p>at last to rejoin his creators in death. </p><p> Uhe V ( U</p><p>V oyage or the </p><p>Neutralia </p><p>By B.

He is </p><p>financed by Hugh Burgoyne. They con- </p><p>struct a large shell, christened Neutralia, </p><p>with which to explore beyond our plan- </p><p>et’s atmosphere. The two, with Jacob </p><p>Flint, an old employee, set out for our </p><p>satellite. After starting, two former em- </p><p>ployees, Kobloth and Whipps, discharged </p><p>for spying, are found stowaways in the </p><p>storeroom. </p><p> After some experiments in arresting</p><p>the stupendous speed of the shell they </p><p>arrive safely at the moon.

The treacherous pair instantly dash </p><p>for the shell, hoping to make off with it </p><p>and later return to exploit the vast wealth </p><p>they have seen.

Then the shell is headed </p><p>for Mars. Traveling at a million miles </p><p>an hour they arrive and alight. They find </p><p>the surface is covered with a network of </p><p>great cables.

Other carriages arrive and join in </p><p>the attack.</p><p> The story continues:</p><p>Startled by its strangeness, the voy- </p><p>agers halted involuntarily, and in- </p><p>stantly saw that along all the cables, con- </p><p>verging toward the spot beneath which </p><p>lay the Neutralia, hundreds of the spider- </p><p>Martians were racing. The air was rent </p><p>with their weird shrill cries, and </p><p>throbbed with the drone of their power- </p><p>ful propelling mechanisms. In a few sec- </p><p>onds the nearest would be directly above </p><p>them! </p><p> "Quick, into the globe!” snapped Car-</p><p>scadden. "Give me a lift up and I’ll </p><p>throw out another ladder.

A second more </p><p>and a rope ladder had fallen beside the </p><p>big sentinel, who, revolver in hand, held </p><p>off the two scoundrels who had tried to </p><p>seize it. </p><p> "Stand back! You two go last—or stay</p><p>as dead men!” he shouted angrily. "Up </p><p>you go, Flint,” he ordered in the same </p><p>breath. </p><p> At once Flint scrambled up the sway-</p><p>ing steps, and Burgoyne, still threatening </p><p>the desperate pair of ruffians with his </p><p>leveled revolver, was on the point of </p><p>following his example, when from above </p><p>came a cry: </p><p> "Look out, Hugh! Jump for it!”</p><p> But he was too late; for a bright thin</p><p>wire had dropped from aloft, caught in </p><p>the ladder's middle, and instantly had </p><p>dragged it away from the globe, with </p><p>Burgoyne hanging by one hand to its last </p><p>step. </p><p> "Jump for the door, Hugh! Quick!”</p><p>shouted Carscadden desperately. </p><p> "Sure!” muttered Burgoyne to himself.</p><p>"But it’s a cent to a million dollars I miss </p><p>it.” And as the end of the ladder dan- </p><p>gling from the rapidly updrawn wire came </p><p>abreast of the door, he twisted around </p><p>with a supreme effort and made a flying </p><p>«illl </p><p>gSHj </p><p>ilfSp </p><p>mmiP </p><p>mmkmi </p><p>‘A dense, poisonous fog rushed through </p><p>the narrowing slit left by the closing </p><p>door." </p><p>728 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>leap for the open door, where with out- </p><p>stretched hands the two already there </p><p>awaited to snatch at him. He only just </p><p>managed to clutch the outer flange of the </p><p>doorway, but in a breath the two had </p><p>hauled him to safety. Looking back he </p><p>saw what he had so narrowly escaped. A </p><p>score of gleaming wires were uncoiling </p><p>and falling toward the globe. </p><p> "What are we to do about the two</p><p>down there? We can’t leave them to that </p><p>sort of death! Got any more rope, Ayl- </p><p>mer?” cried Burgoyne, staring at the two </p><p>wretches below, who, crouching close to </p><p>the in-curving wall of the globe, were </p><p>trying to evade a perfect rain of wires </p><p>which were descending upon it. </p><p> "Help! For God’s sake, help!” they</p><p>screamed in a frenzy of terror, and there </p><p>was very good reason for even such fears </p><p>as theirs. For already, not far off, Kob- </p><p>loth had seen several of the bat-like crea- </p><p>tures captured, and drawn up by the </p><p>wires, and heard their shrieks of agony </p><p>abruptly silenced as their captors pre- </p><p>sumably devoured them immediately. </p><p>The ladder, of course, had been ripped </p><p>away and aloft, as though it were no </p><p>more than pack-thread. </p><p> "Look out for the rope!” warned Bur-</p><p>goyne, flinging an end of the line Car- </p><p>scadden had snatched from a handy cleat </p><p>by the doorway. "Only one of you at a </p><p>time—it won’t bear more than that!” </p><p> Both men clutched the rope together</p><p>and clung to it fiercely. </p><p> "Let go, one of you!” shouted the sci-</p><p>entist angrily. The clawed and hooked </p><p>wires were hovering near them, and fran- </p><p>tic with terror neither of the unfortunate </p><p>men would relinquish his grip. </p><p> "Let go! One must die—or both!”</p><p>shouted Burgoyne, as a wire with a fiery </p><p>red star at the end of it wras cast by a </p><p>Martian toward them. The crack of a re- </p><p>volver rang out behind him; Carscadden </p><p>had fired at the car above. The shot took </p><p> effect, apparently, for the fiery red star</p><p>at once fell harmlessly to the red sand. </p><p> With a frenzied strength the Austrian</p><p>snatched his companion’s grip from the </p><p>rope, and shouted, "Haul up! He shall </p><p>die first,” and as he shouted he sprang </p><p>with astounding agility high up and </p><p>caught the line far up its length. But </p><p>Whipps, too, made a desperate leap—a </p><p>leap to evade a fiery star that swung to- </p><p>ward him. </p><p> He w'as too late; the point of light fell</p><p>on his shoulder. With a wild cry of </p><p>agony he fell back on the sand, his face </p><p>and body contorted horribly, as one elec- </p><p>trocuted. In a flash a clawing wire had </p><p>seized him, and his rigid body was hauled </p><p>aloft into the network of cables. In a </p><p>moment Kobloth was dragged inside the </p><p>globe, and the fear in his eyes was un- </p><p>forgettable. </p><p>Burgoyne had his hand on the door </p><p>immediately, when the scientist </p><p>stopped him. </p><p> "No! not yet. We must keep it open</p><p>for a little,” he wrarned him. "We have </p><p>nearly exhausted our compressed air </p><p>tanks, and must replenish them before </p><p>the door is closed. I have already set the </p><p>electric pumps going—it will not take </p><p>more than an hour at the outside; but we </p><p>dare not make a start with nearly empty </p><p>tanks. Moreover we must try and hold </p><p>on until daylight.” </p><p> "Why?” asked his friend in surprize.</p><p> "Because before daylight we should be</p><p>leaving Mars on the side opposite to the </p><p>earth, and going still farther away from </p><p>our planet.” </p><p> "Well, we have our guns and plenty</p><p>of shells, and may be able to stand the </p><p>brutes off. But I don’t fancy those fiery </p><p>stars. Is it possible they could electro- </p><p>cute us through the steel walls?" he asked </p><p>gravely. </p><p> "No, I don’t think so. Just now we</p><p>THE VOYAGE OF THE NEUTRALIA </p><p>729 </p><p>have the neutralium shell above us, and </p><p>the outer steel wall is insulated from the </p><p>inner lining; you remember I thought it </p><p>advisable in case of electrical disturb- </p><p>ances we might encounter. Of course </p><p>what other offensive resources they have </p><p>at their command we cannot tell. We </p><p>can only keep our eyes open, and if we </p><p>have to start, well, we must chance it,” </p><p>declared Carscadden philosophically. "As </p><p>for the clawed wires, I have something </p><p>here that will fix them if they menace </p><p>us,” he added quietly, as he stepped to a </p><p>near-by chest and extracted from it a </p><p>couple of short-handled and very large- </p><p>headed instruments. "These things are </p><p>carbons, insulated from the handles. </p><p>When we switch on all the current at </p><p>our command, the heat of the electric </p><p>arc between them will be quite consid- </p><p>erable. I think it will melt their wires </p><p>without much difficulty.” </p><p> "Fine! Here’s your chance to experi-</p><p>ment—a couple of the infernal things </p><p>sticking to us just outside the doorway!” </p><p>cried Burgoyne, as pleased as a boy at the </p><p>possibility of a really effective offensive. </p><p> "Right! Here, get the wire between</p><p>the carbon points, and I’ll switch on the </p><p>juice,” cried the scientist, handing him an </p><p>instrument. </p><p> A moment, and Burgoyne raised a</p><p>hand in signal. The switch was moved, </p><p>a flash of vivid light leapt between the </p><p>points, and instantly the wire was fused </p><p>and fell apart. At once the second wire </p><p>was so treated with a like result. At this </p><p>an excited shrill whistling broke out </p><p>among the Martians in their cars above. </p><p> "That’s got them guessing!” cried Bur-</p><p>goyne jubilantly. "Reckon they thought </p><p>no one knew anything about electricity </p><p>but themselves.” </p><p> "Likely, but I’m afraid they’ve got</p><p>other things up their sleeves to try out on </p><p>us yet. However, in another thirty min- </p><p>utes we can close the door and leave </p><p>them. But we must fight for that thirty </p><p>minutes. Kobloth had better have his</p><p>gun back; we can’t worry about trifles in </p><p>such a tight corner,” said their captain </p><p>coolly. </p><p> "Thank you, Mr. Carscadden; I’ll do</p><p>my best. I’m quite a fair shot,” replied </p><p>the Austrian gratefully. </p><p> "Better get busy,” advised old Flint.</p><p>"Those uglies are trying to throw a net </p><p>all over us.” </p><p> True enough, a perfect maze of</p><p>clawed, disk-ended and star-tailed wires </p><p>was enmeshing the great globe. Many </p><p>fell on the neutralium cover, and failed </p><p>to grip it, but numerous others attached </p><p>themselves to the uncovered steel half. </p><p>The four men at once commenced to rain </p><p>bullets amid their foes, and the cries of </p><p>rage and pain that answered the volleys </p><p>told of the damage being wrought. </p><p>Shortly half a dozen cars and their wreird </p><p>occupants had crashed to the sand; and </p><p>many of the wires lay broken and tan- </p><p>gled. All that came near the door were </p><p>fused instantly by the carbons, and for a </p><p>little it seemed as if the battle favored </p><p>the voyagers. But at the globe’s side, </p><p>away from the door, many disks attached </p><p>themselves and could not be come at by </p><p>the defenders; and these began to draw </p><p>the Neutralia along at a good pace. The </p><p>strength of the wires and their grip must </p><p>have been enormous, for the globe </p><p>plowed a deep rut through the sand as </p><p>though steam winches and giant cables </p><p>had hold of it. Luckily the door faced </p><p>the canal, so that they were drawn away </p><p>from it. </p><p> "Another ten minutes,” said the sci-</p><p>entist anxiously. "Then, night or no </p><p>night, we must go.” </p><p> With redoubled fury the revolvers</p><p>spat their deadly missiles among the be- </p><p>siegers, and car after car came crashing </p><p>from the high cables. The execution </p><p>caused even these fearless monsters to </p><p>730 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>halt their proceedings. Suddenly the </p><p>globe’s movement stopped, the wires </p><p>were drawn rapidly upward, and the </p><p>ranks of the enemy parted and left a </p><p>clear right of way between them. A reso- </p><p>nant clang, like the sound of a huge </p><p>gong, came from the western cliff, and </p><p>a bright object, flashing along a cable at </p><p>terrific speed, rushed between the two </p><p>groups of now silent Martians, and came </p><p>to a stop directly over the Neutrdia. </p><p> "What now?” cried Burgoyne. "What</p><p>devils’ game is this?” </p><p> Even as he spoke, from this new arri-</p><p>val there was let down, by thick wires, a </p><p>large cylindrical object. Swaying to and </p><p>fro, as though being carefully adjusted, </p><p>it finally came to rest exactly opposite </p><p>and a few feet from the globe’s open </p><p>door. A speck of bluish flame glowed </p><p>in the center of its only visible end. </p><p> "Look out! Close the door!” screamed</p><p>the Austrian. "That looks like a bomb, </p><p>with its fuse lit!” </p><p>The scientist, being nearest, reached </p><p>the closing-lever before his compan- </p><p>ions. But even while throwing his weight </p><p>on it, his scientific instincts compelled </p><p>him to peer forward to obtain one </p><p>glimpse of this unknown offensive. That </p><p>little part of a second’s delay was his un- </p><p>doing. </p><p> Before the steel rod slid home there</p><p>came a burst of vivid flame from the </p><p>pointing cylinder, which seemed to </p><p>shrivel up and vanish as a vast cloud of </p><p>coal-black vapor poured from it. A </p><p>dense, stinking, poisonous fog rushed </p><p>through the narrowing slit left by the </p><p>closing door, and Carscadden was for an </p><p>instant immersed in its strangling folds. </p><p>As the door thudded softly home, he </p><p>fell to the floor, gasping and insensible. </p><p> Burgoyne, who was nearest him, reeled</p><p>a step away, coughing and choking, but </p><p>by a strong effort of will recovered suf- </p><p>ficiently to drag the scientist farther back </p><p>in the chamber. Kobloth and Flint too</p><p>got a taste of the malignant stuff as it </p><p>wafted about, but were not seriously af- </p><p>fected. </p><p> "What’s to be done?” cried Burgoyne.</p><p>"Carscadden, I think, will soon recover—• </p><p>he is breathing quite normally again. But </p><p>heaven knows we should get out of this </p><p>instantly; and only Carscadden knows </p><p>anything about this aerial navigation.” </p><p> "Yes, we must not delay a minute. I</p><p>understand the registers—we must chance </p><p>our direction. You can work the wheel, </p><p>and Flint attend to the captain,” replied </p><p>Kobloth, his technical and scientific train- </p><p>ing aiding his natural resolute hardihood. </p><p> At that moment a terrific crash, as of</p><p>some heavy body falling on the cover </p><p>above, filled the globe with a deafening </p><p>clamor. </p><p> "That settles it!” shouted Burgoyne.</p><p>"We chance it! Are you ready, Kob- </p><p>loth?” </p><p> "Go ahead!” cried the Austrian, al-</p><p>ready at the registers. "Himmel! over </p><p>with the cover!” he ordered impatiently. </p><p> The great neutralium cover turned,</p><p>the swinging platform rocked violently, </p><p>and the fog-obscured windows of the </p><p>lower half were hidden; w'hile the un- </p><p>covered upper lights exposed a cloudy </p><p>sky, barred by a network of gigantic </p><p>cables along which hundreds of the Mar- </p><p>tians moving w^ere visible. A pause, as </p><p>the cover pushed its way through the </p><p>sand beneath the globe; a shock, as the </p><p>globe rocked, then righted itself; then </p><p>Mars was sinking rapidly away from </p><p>them. Up through the cables, tearing </p><p>a great gap in the network as though it </p><p>were mosquito veiling, soared the Neu- </p><p>tral/a, passing with a roar and a thrill of </p><p>heat through the Martian atmosphere. </p><p>And so out into the cold and soundless </p><p>THE VOYAGE OF THE NEUTRALIA </p><p>731 </p><p>night of space it shot, away from Mars, </p><p>away from the sun, and awray from our </p><p>planet. </p><p>8.	Ten Million Miles an Hour!</p><p>ii'WTELL’ ^ats settled,” observed </p><p> W Burgoyne philosophically as he</p><p>locked the wheel. "We are out in space, </p><p>sure enough, but where bound for I </p><p>haven’t the slightest notion. Still, any- </p><p>thing is better than that devilish world </p><p>we have left behind us.” </p><p> "At present we are receding from</p><p>Mars at more than fifty thousand miles </p><p>an hour, and gaining pace every mo- </p><p>ment,” said the Austrian, consulting the </p><p>registers. "The cold of space is acting </p><p>as a tonic to the Neutralia. Where we </p><p>are heading for I cannot say. Some of </p><p>these instruments, not to mention astro- </p><p>nomical navigation, require an expert’s </p><p>handling. We can only hope that Mr. </p><p>Carscadden will soon recover and be able </p><p>to take charge again,” he added fervently. </p><p> Since the awful fate of his companion,</p><p>the Austrian had seemed a changed man. </p><p>Possibly he realized that he had taken his </p><p>life in his hands in the pursuit of his evil </p><p>and vindictive purposes, and that now he </p><p>stood alone, one man among three who </p><p>had every reason to regard him with </p><p>aversion and distrust. He realized, too, </p><p>probably far more deeply than Burgoyne </p><p>and Flint, the hopeless nature of their </p><p>plight if their captain’s stupor did not </p><p>shortly leave him. The fate of all de- </p><p>pended absolutely on the brain of the </p><p>man who alone of all mankind had made </p><p>the probing of space possible. </p><p> Each of the three men, Kobloth as</p><p>earnestly solicitous as the others, did his </p><p>best for the unconscious man, but it </p><p>seemed as though all their efforts would </p><p>be unavailing; his whole system must </p><p>have been saturated with the poisonous </p><p>draft he had quaffed. Hours passed, and </p><p>still he remained unconscious; living, </p><p>breathing, but otherwise inert as a log. </p><p>Meanwhile the Neutralia sped silently on</p><p>through trackless space, speeding out of </p><p>the profound abyss where the greater </p><p>planets swing in their vast and solitary </p><p>orbits. Already the pointers recording in </p><p>tens of thousands on the speed registers </p><p>seemed but faint blurs of shadow on their </p><p>dials. Already the globe was clear of the </p><p>long, conical shadow cast by Mars, and </p><p>the sun was but a small and fiery disk </p><p>that shone steadily to the eastward in a </p><p>jet-black sky; while the earth was now a </p><p>mere speck of dim light hardly discern- </p><p>ible. </p><p> Forty-eight hours went by in this man-</p><p>ner; watching the changeless sky, the </p><p>humming registers, and attending to the </p><p>unconscious man. Forty-eight hours of </p><p>the most intense anxiety; little wonder </p><p>they slept but in short snatches, and their </p><p>bloodshot sunken eyes betrayed that the </p><p>strain was becoming unendurable. Then </p><p>it happened, the sick man’s eyes abruptly </p><p>opened, and he was staring at his com- </p><p>panions quite sanely and naturally. </p><p> "What’s the matter, Hugh?” he mut-</p><p>tered weakly. "I suppose that infernal </p><p>fog stuff knocked me out. Have you </p><p>shut the door? What are the Martians </p><p>doing?” he queried more strongly, his </p><p>eagerness of spirit fast overcoming his </p><p>sickness. </p><p> "The Martians!” laughed Burgoyne as</p><p>he bent affectionately and joyfully over </p><p>his friend. "Don’t worry about them. </p><p>They must be a good many million miles </p><p>astern by this time. But how do you feel </p><p>—thirsty? hungry?” he queried anx- </p><p>iously. </p><p> "What, you have started?” cried Car-</p><p>scadden, sitting bolt-upright in his sur- </p><p>prize. "Why, how long have I been in- </p><p>sensible?” </p><p> "Just forty-eight hours, though it</p><p>seems like years,” replied his friend with </p><p>732 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>a heavy sigh of relief. "Thank heaven </p><p>you are better, and will soon be able to </p><p>skipper the Neutralist again. All I know </p><p>for certain is that we are somewhere out </p><p>in space, and the pointers haven’t been </p><p>visible for ages.” </p><p> "Forty-eight hours!” echoed Carscad-</p><p>den. "Here, give me a hand; I must see </p><p>to this. Forty-eight hours, and going full </p><p>steam ahead!” he repeated, as though </p><p>dazed by the notion. </p><p>With a litle assistance, for he was </p><p>not in any wray injured, and the </p><p>poison seemed to have worked its way </p><p>completely out of his system, he walked </p><p>across to his beloved registers, and bent </p><p>over, studying them earnestly for several </p><p>moments. When he looked up again, his </p><p>eyes held a queer expression, an expres- </p><p>sion of mingled amazement, pride, and </p><p>consternation. </p><p> "Why didn’t you move the cover</p><p>about, and check the speed?” he asked. </p><p> "Well, we were in the dark as to your</p><p>calculations, and were afraid of either </p><p>falling back to Mars, or into the sun. I </p><p>reckoned we were safer out here, and </p><p>Kobloth said there was enough air to </p><p>last us a month,” replied Burgoyne. </p><p> "Yes, perhaps you were safer—that</p><p>cover requires delicate manipulation. But </p><p>it’s high time I woke up. Do you know </p><p>where we are?” asked the scientist. </p><p> "Somewhere out in space. Beyond that</p><p>I haven’t a notion,” replied Burgoyne as </p><p>lightly as though he spoke of a car ride </p><p>over some new country in his own home </p><p>state. </p><p> "As a matter of fact, and to be more</p><p>precise, we certainly are out in space. </p><p>At a rough estimate, we are about ten or </p><p>eleven hours’ run from the planet Jupi- </p><p>ter. When you left Mars it was night, </p><p>and Jupiter being the nearest large plan- </p><p>et, you were naturally attracted by it. </p><p>See, that’s Jupiter, over there. I should </p><p>have thought Kobolth could have told</p><p>you that,” said Carscadden in surprize. </p><p> "He’s been sleeping for several hours</p><p>—and that queer star has grown much </p><p>larger in my watch. I was getting a bit </p><p>worried about it, to say the truth,” de- </p><p>clared Burgoyne apologetically. </p><p> "No wonder it’s been growing larger</p><p>rapidly. Do you know we are rushing to </p><p>it at nearly ten million miles an hour? </p><p>Over 150,000 miles a minute! And as </p><p>the planet is a little to the eastward of </p><p>Mars, we have traversed an arc of its </p><p>orbit, of about six hundred million miles! </p><p>Does that satisfy your ambitions?” </p><p> "That’s breaking records!” cried Bur-</p><p>goyne with raised eyebrows. "Since we </p><p>are so near to this planet Jupiter, why </p><p>not have a look at it. A few hours more </p><p>or less cannot make much difference to </p><p>us, surely.” </p><p> "Jupiter!” echoed Kobloth and Flint</p><p>in the same breath. For the two sleepers </p><p>had now awakened, and had hastened to </p><p>their captain with many expressions of </p><p>surprize and relief at his welcome recov- </p><p>ery. "Jupiter! Yes, I thought that blaz- </p><p>ing orb was the huge planet, but I could </p><p>not credit we had hurtled through space </p><p>so quickly as all that. Yes, I should like </p><p>to have a closer look at Jupiter. Does it </p><p>make much difference to our safety if we </p><p>hold on for a few hours longer?” and a </p><p>light came into Kobloth’s dark, strong </p><p>eyes that was not entirely inspired by </p><p>greed and selfish ambition; for at heart </p><p>the Austrian was really a scientist, whose </p><p>evil instincts had been so uncontrolled </p><p>and dominant that they had wrecked </p><p>what might have been a notable life. </p><p> "No, I don’t think it can make much</p><p>difference to us. I may frankly admit </p><p>that our chances of hitting the earth </p><p>again from this vast distance are quite </p><p>a gamble. But seeing that we have evi- </p><p>dence of the stupendous speed the Neu- </p><p>tralia is capable of, the matter of time </p><p>THE VOYAGE OF THE NEUTRALIA </p><p>733 </p><p>hardly needs to be considered, and the </p><p>problem of return simply resolves itself </p><p>into a matter of our ability to evade or </p><p>turn to our advantage the various centers </p><p>of attraction we shall encounter,” replied </p><p>the scientist thoughtfully. </p><p> And so after a little more discussion</p><p>it was decided, and the great steel globe </p><p>was permitted to continue its headlong </p><p>rush through the black abyss toward the </p><p>huge orb of Jupiter. That giant of our </p><p>planetary family, whose diameter exceeds </p><p>85,000 miles, whose day is no more than </p><p>live hours, and night no longer, whose </p><p>four moons race round his great girth </p><p>with a speed far in excess of our own </p><p>placid luminary’s sedate behavior, and </p><p>whose year contains 4,332 of its brief </p><p>days. Luckily there are no inhabitants to </p><p>suffer the inconvenience of such things, </p><p>for the huge orb is, like the sun, still in a </p><p>gaseous condition, and its heat and light </p><p>of its own making, though its texture is </p><p>much more concentrated than the sun’s </p><p>tenuous immensity. </p><p> In less than two hours from his recov-</p><p>ery Carscadden ordered his friend to re- </p><p>verse the cover, and Jupiter, now a large, </p><p>glowing disk of fast-increasing bright- </p><p>ness, went out of sight beneath them as </p><p>they dropped with terrific but shortly </p><p>abating speed toward it. Exactly eleven </p><p>hours after he emerged from his stupor </p><p>he gave the command to reverse the </p><p>cover again. </p><p>9.	Near to Destruction</p><p>AS IT swung back, letting light through </p><p>L the lower windows, the intrepid voy- </p><p>agers saw the giant planet below them, a </p><p>huge whirling orb of glowing cloudiness, </p><p>with vast, tormented eddies of super- </p><p>heated gas spinning and leaping within </p><p>it. Across this expanse of titanic activity </p><p>a black speck moved quickly. </p><p> "The inner moon,” explained their</p><p>captain. "It revolves around the planet </p><p>in forty-two hours. It is nearly four </p><p>times as large as our own moon. We </p><p>shall tty and land on it.”</p><p> Nearer and nearer sank the globe to</p><p>the huge glowing orb, and distinctly vis- </p><p>ible were the curious belts of alternately </p><p>liquefying and vaporizing elements. </p><p>Steadily it was growing larger and soon </p><p>it dominated the black sky like a vast </p><p>crimson sun. </p><p> Suddenly a tremendous crash resounded</p><p>on the globe’s exterior, and in a moment </p><p>it was subjected to a tremendous bom- </p><p>bardment, as though batteries of heavy </p><p>artillery were playing upon it. The globe </p><p>vibrated and trembled with the incessant </p><p>blows, and great scratches appeared oil </p><p>the outer surface of the windows. The </p><p>temperature at once rose considerably, </p><p>and the globe’s occupants panted and </p><p>perspired with every movement. </p><p> Carscadden hastily wrote on a piece of</p><p>paper and passed it around, for it was </p><p>impossible to hear a word in that deafen- </p><p>ing uproar. </p><p> "We are passing through a swarm of</p><p>meteorites,” he had written. "They are on </p><p>their way to Jupiter. I think the Neutra- </p><p>lia can safely stand it, unless we meet an </p><p>unusually large fragment. However, we </p><p>can only carry on and chance to the luck </p><p>that has so far befriended us.” </p><p> The supply of missiles seemed inex-</p><p>haustible, and the bombardment contin- </p><p>ued for over an hour. But at last, ab- </p><p>ruptly as it had started, the crashing up- </p><p>roar ceased. Shortly after, on the vast </p><p>glowing disk a faint scintillation broke </p><p>out in one particular location. It was the </p><p>cloud of myriads of meteorites rushing to </p><p>their destruction, fused into vapor by the </p><p>friction of their passage through the plan- </p><p>et’s gaseous envelope. </p><p> Now the black speck of the inner</p><p>moon loomed larger, and it could be seen </p><p>as a round dark object on the dull fiery </p><p>734 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>mass of Jupiter. At the command of </p><p>their captain the cover was tilted a little </p><p>to shut out somewhat the direct pull of </p><p>Jupiter. </p><p> The Neutvalia, as though tired after its</p><p>long voyage, sank down slowly toward </p><p>the rapidly moving moon. All going </p><p>well, their paths would soon intersect. </p><p>Absorbed in watching this satellite, the </p><p>watchers for a little overlooked the fact </p><p>that Jupiter had other moons to reckon </p><p>with. It was Kobloth who first reminded </p><p>them of their oversight. </p><p> ‘Another moon!” he shouted excited-</p><p>ly, pointing to a side window. "It is com- ' </p><p>ing direct for us — we shall be run </p><p>down!” </p><p> With one hasty glance at the approach-</p><p>ing menace, Carscadden leapt to the </p><p>wheel. Every breath was held as the. </p><p>scientist swung the cover, and it never </p><p>seemed to move so slowly; for each had </p><p>seen that the Neutralia, dropping now </p><p>but slowly, was almost directly in the </p><p>path of this rushing peril. Obviously the </p><p>satellite would overtake the globe unless </p><p>it could be moved quickly aside from its </p><p>present path. Was this to be the end?— </p><p>to be shattered to fragments by a chance </p><p>collision with this passing moon? Gradu- </p><p>ally, under their captain’s expert hand- </p><p>ling, the Neutralia came to a standstill, </p><p>and hung poised in space awaiting the </p><p>fateful moment. Nearer and nearer </p><p>rushed the satellite, bulking dark and </p><p>enormous as it came for them. </p><p> "It may miss us,” said Kobloth in a</p><p>low voice, and his face was drawn and </p><p>haggard. </p><p> "I have done all I can do,” muttered</p><p>Carscadden. "We are now isolated from </p><p>all attraction save that of Jupiter, and </p><p>we shall begin to fall toward it again </p><p>directly the satellite has passed—if we </p><p>live to see it,” he whispered under his </p><p>breath. </p><p>Nearer came the hurtling black </p><p>globe, so near that the men, fear- </p><p>fully watching it, braced themselves for</p><p>the final second of dissolution. Plunging </p><p>them into darkness, it hid Jupiter from </p><p>their view as it passed, and then—light! </p><p>They lived! The moon had rushed past, </p><p>though the clearance could not have been </p><p>expressed in distance; it was a matter of </p><p>split seconds only. </p><p> "That was worse than the Martian spi-</p><p>ders!” exclaimed old Flint, wiping the </p><p>perspiration from his forehead. </p><p> "I’m not stuck on another such stunt</p><p>as that, myself!” agreed big Burgoyne </p><p>with the deepest conviction. </p><p> The landing on the inner satellite was</p><p>comparatively easy, and they grounded </p><p>safely on its western* edge, where both </p><p>Jupiter and the distant sun were visible. </p><p>But there was no landing on that little </p><p>w'orld for the disappointed voyagers, the </p><p>test-tubes showing no trace of atmos- </p><p>phere. </p><p> "There is no air whatever on this little</p><p>world—at least none that our tubes can </p><p>detect. We shall have to remain inside </p><p>while we do it,” announced their captain. </p><p> "Do what?” asked Kobloth.</p><p> "Make the circuit round Jupiter. We</p><p>shall have to travel rather slowly; for the </p><p>cover will need some very fine adjust- </p><p>ment to hold our position as we make </p><p>the circuit,” explained the scientist. </p><p> "And after that?” queried Burgoyne.</p><p> "After that we must try and return</p><p>to our own planet. I say 'try’ because it </p><p>will be a very difficult task—in fact, a </p><p>pure gamble. It is only right that you </p><p>should all be aware of that fact,” replied </p><p>Carscadden gravely. </p><p> "You have navigated us safely so far,</p><p>Aylmer, and I’ll put my last cent on your </p><p>making it. Now I think I’ll take a </p><p>snooze. I haven’t had a real nap since </p><p>you were bowled over. Is there anything </p><p>THE VOYAGE OF THE NEUTRALIA </p><p>735 </p><p>to do, or see, that is more than usually </p><p>interesting?” said Burgoyne. </p><p> "No. We shall remain on this satel-</p><p>lite, and be carried round with it. It’s </p><p>not safe to approach any closer. If any- </p><p>thing happens I will call you; my long </p><p>sleep has left me quite fresh, so I shall </p><p>take a number of photographs,” replied </p><p>the scientist, turning to his array of cam- </p><p>eras. </p><p> Burgoyne and the Austrian were soon</p><p>enfolded in their rugs. But Flint, always </p><p>deeply interested in his master’s work, </p><p>watched and aided him with his cameras. </p><p>From one of the windows they looked </p><p>directly down on the heaving, gaseous </p><p>surface of the monster planet; from an- </p><p>other the sun was visible, but appeared </p><p>little more than a star of intense brilliancy </p><p>amid a host of other lesser points of lumi- </p><p>nosity. As the satellite moved round its </p><p>parent orb, Flint remarked in surprize </p><p>that it always appeared in the same rela- </p><p>tive position to them. </p><p> "Should have thought it would have</p><p>gone out of sight,” said he, referring to </p><p>the vast globe. </p><p> "But this moon is like our satellite,”</p><p>explained his master. "It always keeps </p><p>the same hemisphere facing inward—it’s </p><p>a peculiarity moons have.” </p><p> As the hours sped by they noted that</p><p>though the huge planet shone with the </p><p>dull light of its own fiery gases, yet it was </p><p>markedly brighter where the sunlight fell </p><p>upon it. It was new, crescent, half, and </p><p>full, in turns. </p><p> Ten hours after their grounding Car-</p><p>scadden made a careful study of his reg- </p><p>isters and instruments, and afterward </p><p>W'as busy for a little while with his pencil. </p><p>Then he made the following announce- </p><p>ment: </p><p> "Since wre landed, Jupiter, as well as</p><p>Mars and the earth, has moved and al- </p><p>tered its relative position considerably. </p><p>From here to our planet, in a direct line, </p><p>is now nearly 700,000,000 miles. Our </p><p>air supply, I find, will last the four of us </p><p>just seventy-nine hours; that is using up </p><p>the compressed stores and the reserve ox- </p><p>ygen. That means that we shall have to </p><p>travel at express speed, in spite of the </p><p>risk; we have no margin of safety for </p><p>possible emergencies at the end of our </p><p>long journey. Your presence, Kobloth, </p><p>is most inconvenient, not to say danger- </p><p>ous. Three would be able to exist in the </p><p>Neutralia for over a hundred hours. If </p><p>we can avoid the one danger that I fear, </p><p>we need not use the ejector door for un- </p><p>desirable passengers.” His voice was </p><p>quite courteous, very grave, and yet hard </p><p>as granite. </p><p> "And that one danger is-?” asked</p><p>Kobloth, whose face had grown gray and </p><p>anxious. </p><p> "The danger of starting the Neutralia</p><p>at a wrong angle. If we do not go abso- </p><p>lutely straight to the earth we shall in- </p><p>evitably be drawn into the sun. And with </p><p>so small a reserve of air we cannot afford </p><p>to check our terrific pace in time to avert </p><p>that fate,” replied Carscadden quietly. </p><p> "When do we start?” inquired Bur-</p><p>goyne, who was impressed by their lead- </p><p>er's quiet statement. </p><p> "In half an hour—if we can.”</p><p>10.	An Error of a Decimal</p><p>7" hat’s to hinder us starting?” </p><p> » T asked Flint, first voicing the sur-</p><p>prize of the three listeners. </p><p> "Our path—I have just found that</p><p>it will take us directly across the path of </p><p>Jupiter’s fourth satellite. In half an hour, </p><p>when we must cross its path, it will be </p><p>there, or very nearly so. At least it will </p><p>be no more than .10513 of its diameter </p><p>away from the point of intersection. I </p><p>need not say that the margin is far too </p><p>narrow for safety.” </p><p>736 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> "Can we not wait, and give it time to</p><p>pass by?” queried Kobloth. </p><p> "Yes, we shall have to. Cut that means</p><p>missing our straight line earthward. But </p><p>we shall have to move as soon as this </p><p>satellite has passed the critical spot, and </p><p>even then it will be a mere chance if we </p><p>miss it,” said Carscadden. </p><p> "Devil take a planet with four moons!”</p><p>grumbled the stolid Burgoyne, who </p><p>seemed by far the least moved of the </p><p>three listeners. </p><p> More waiting in silent suspense; then,</p><p>eye to telescope, their captain gave the </p><p>signal. At once the great cover was </p><p>turned, and the satellite on which it had </p><p>rested sank from beneath their feet, and </p><p>they saw passing above them the huge </p><p>dark ball of the outermost of Jupiter’s </p><p>attendant satellites. Only for a moment </p><p>was it visible, so rapid was the pace </p><p>the Neutralia at once attained; then they </p><p>were out in the darkness and emptiness </p><p>of space, homeward bound—if all went </p><p>well. </p><p> During the following hours there was</p><p>nothing to mark their progress save the </p><p>spinning pointers on the speed dials of </p><p>the register—no sense of movement </p><p>within or perception of motion without </p><p>the globe. They were apparently hanging </p><p>in the center of a vast sphere of jet-black </p><p>darkness, a sphere dusted with points, </p><p>and streams, and clusters of starry light; </p><p>yet each man knew that he was being </p><p>hurled through this terrible darkness at </p><p>nearly 10,000,000 miles every sixty min- </p><p>utes, and each man feared that the end </p><p>of this daring venture would be death. </p><p> At last sixty long hours had crawled</p><p>by. Now the men were inclined to be dull </p><p>and querulous; for as well as the nerve- </p><p>racking suspense, the air was more than </p><p>a little vitiated. For the tanks did not </p><p>release a fraction more than the amount </p><p>needful to sustain the vital spark of ex- </p><p>istence, and the carbon-consuming appa- </p><p>ratus did not work altogether satisfac- </p><p>torily.</p><p> At the end of the sixtieth hour both</p><p>Mars and the earth loomed large again, </p><p>and the sun had regained much of its </p><p>splendor. It was evident that they would </p><p>pass Mars at a good distance to one side; </p><p>and it was also evident that their course </p><p>would take them a long distance from the </p><p>longed-for earth, and the Neutralia would </p><p>be governed entirely by the pull of the </p><p>sun’s vast mass. </p><p> Carscadden worked out his calculations</p><p>anew, going a long way back in his for- </p><p>mulas to make certain that no loophole </p><p>of error had evaded him, and it was then </p><p>that he discovered the little slip in a deci- </p><p>mal point—a slip a careless schoolboy </p><p>might have been guilty of, but quite un- </p><p>looked for in one who regarded calculus </p><p>as a mild form of recreation. The discov- </p><p>ery hurt his pride far more than the fact </p><p>of the terrible danger it had led them </p><p>into. Such a trivial error was as a deadly </p><p>sin to the scientific mind. </p><p> The others, when he told them, did not</p><p>seem to appreciate the gravity of his con- </p><p>fession. </p><p> "But a point? I don’t sec anything to</p><p>worry about,” said Burgoyne a little con- </p><p>temptuously. </p><p> "No?” sneered Carscadden with a</p><p>most unusual bitterness. "I hardly </p><p>thought you would. Nevertheless I think </p><p>it has signed our death warrant. When I </p><p>delayed our departure from Jupiter’s in- </p><p>ner satellite, it was to allow another of </p><p>the four moons to pass clear of our </p><p>course. The clearance I then stated was </p><p>but .10513 of its diameter. That was </p><p>an error; it should have been 1.0513. On </p><p>that footing there would not have been </p><p>the least danger, and we could have </p><p>started at the exact second requisite to </p><p>reach our planet safely. Now we shall </p><p>most certainly miss it.” </p><p> "Miss it?” echoed Burgoyne. "But</p><p> W. T.—6</p><p>THE VOYAGE OF THE NEUTRALIA </p><p>737 </p><p>cannot we stop the Neutralia, and make </p><p>a fresh start?” </p><p> "You mean just cruise about until the</p><p>right moment comes round again. Cer- </p><p>tainly we could, but for our air supply; </p><p>long before that moment arrives the sup- </p><p>ply would have been exhausted. No, it </p><p>is out of the running; nevertheless we </p><p>must stop the Neutralia at once, as there </p><p>is just a ghost of a chance that by very </p><p>careful manipulation we might be able </p><p>to edge into the gravitational field of the </p><p>planet Venus—I mean into its effective </p><p>range so far as we are concerned. But </p><p>it is only a chance, and a mighty slim </p><p>one,” aflirmed the scientist coolly. "How- </p><p>ever, let us try it. Turn the cover, Hugh,” </p><p>he commanded with decision. </p><p>Burgoyne leapt to the wheel with re- </p><p>newed cheerfulness; it was a relief to </p><p>be doing something. His nature craved </p><p>activity, and he became uneasy and irri- </p><p>table when denied such expression of his </p><p>superabundant energy. But for the first </p><p>time the wheel seemed very hard to start </p><p>in motion. Surprized, he put out his full </p><p>strength and strained at it. Still there </p><p>was no movement. </p><p> "What the devil has come to it?” he</p><p>exclaimed angrily. "Here, you fellows, </p><p>give me a hand,” he called to his com- </p><p>panions hastily, as his face abruptly paled </p><p>at the thought which had suddenly come </p><p>to him. </p><p> That thought was also known to the</p><p>three men who flew to his assistance. </p><p>But no man voiced it. In silence they </p><p>pulled, pushed, and strained until the per- </p><p>spiration streamed from them. But all in </p><p>vain—the cover would not budge a sin- </p><p>gle inch! </p><p> "Something has happened! We are</p><p>doomed!” cried Kobloth. </p><p> "I am afraid that is the truth,” said</p><p>their captain grimly. "If we fail to move </p><p>the cover, nothing short of the sun itself </p><p>W. T.—7 </p><p>can stop us, and we are now isolated from</p><p>every attraction save his. I ought to have </p><p>foreseen and prepared for such a misfor- </p><p>tune.” </p><p> "How? What has happened?” asked</p><p>Flint, incredulous that any misfortune </p><p>should long defy his master. </p><p> "Well, it seems to me that very likely</p><p>a small meteorite fragment has forced </p><p>its way between the steel globe and its </p><p>cover, and so made it jam. Unfortunate- </p><p>ly we have no means of finding out if </p><p>this is the case, or combating it if we </p><p>knew this was the trouble,” said Carscad- </p><p>den rather wearily. "If there was any </p><p>hope of saving ourselves,” he continued, </p><p>"we might prolong existence a little by </p><p>removing Kobloth. But what is the use, </p><p>when in a few hours our end is certain— </p><p>unless we can move the cover? All we </p><p>can do is to face with resolution the in- </p><p>evitable, as befits men.” </p><p> "How will it be, this plunge into the</p><p>sun?” asked Kobloth slowly. </p><p> "Instantaneous. At the rate we shall</p><p>rush into the huge corona of flaming </p><p>gases we shall be fused into incandes- </p><p>cence quicker than a moth is consumed </p><p>in a furnace,” replied the scientist. </p><p> Even stolid Burgoyne looked startled.</p><p>Fused into incandescent vapor in a frac- </p><p>tion of a second! It might be merciful </p><p>and absolutely painless, but it was a sin- </p><p>gularly unpleasant fate to contemplate. </p><p> Ten hours went by. Haggard-faced,</p><p>breathing heavily in the vitiated air, the </p><p>four men sat silent, moodily staring into </p><p>vacancy, and each affecting a stoical in- </p><p>difference he was far from experiencing. </p><p> The slave of science, by force of habit</p><p>their captain made occasional inspections </p><p>of his dials and registers. A moment ago </p><p>he had pointed to one of the windows </p><p>and announced without emotion: </p><p> "We are now making 12,000,000</p><p>miles an hour. We have passed the </p><p>earth’s orbit already, missing our planet. </p><p>738 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>See, it is there, like a huge crescent moon! </p><p>In about another seven or eight hours we </p><p>shall be in the sun—and the voyage will </p><p>be ended!” </p><p>11.	A Last Effort! Venus</p><p>“T T ow long will the air supply last?” </p><p> AjL asked Burgoyne after a little.</p><p> "Nearly eight hours, just enough to</p><p>reach the sun,” replied the scientist. </p><p> "And if the cover would move, what</p><p>would you do?” </p><p> "Try and land on the planet Venus,</p><p>Hugh. We should be passing its orbit, </p><p>and not very far from the planet itself, </p><p>in another hour,” replied his friend. </p><p> "Well, here goes for one last effort;</p><p>I’ll either break that gearing or move </p><p>the blasted thing,” declared Burgoyne </p><p>with a sudden wrath that overstrained </p><p>nerves are prone to exhibit. </p><p> Without a word Kobloth leapt to his</p><p>feet and joined him, and the two began </p><p>tugging viciously at the obdurate wheel. </p><p>The energy and despair inspired every </p><p>ounce of muscle in the two attackers, and </p><p>the gearing rattled and trembled under </p><p>the tremendous strain they subjected it </p><p>to. Suddenly Burgoyne gave a wild shout; </p><p>the wheel had seemed to move the merest </p><p>trifle. </p><p> Instantly Carscadden and Flint flung</p><p>themselves also upon it. This way and </p><p>that, the four desperate men fought with </p><p>the gearing, and at once a faint harsh </p><p>grinding sound was audible below them. </p><p>It was the cosmic fragment being forced </p><p>between the steel wall and the cover. </p><p> ’An ounce more—she’s coming!”</p><p>shouted Burgoyne fiercely. </p><p> A loud, rasping, shattering noise, and</p><p>the wheel spun round with a jerk that </p><p>sent the men hurtling over one another; </p><p>hands were bleeding and bodies bruised </p><p>—but the cover was moving!</p><p> "She’s free! We’ve done it!” cried</p><p>the four men hysterically. </p><p> They were quickly on their feet again,</p><p>and rushed to a window. The sun was </p><p>now beneath them, and hidden from </p><p>view, and in the sky overhead shone the </p><p>earth, a brilliant star, and much nearer an- </p><p>other as brilliant, the white disk of Ve- </p><p>nus. Now but half a million miles dis- </p><p>tant, it gleamed like a great full moon, </p><p>a glaring circle of light cut out of a black </p><p>background. Would they be able to </p><p>reach it in time, and had it a breathable </p><p>atmosphere? Each brain was concen- </p><p>trated on these two queries. </p><p> "We have barely seven hours’ air left,</p><p>and we must now endeavor to greatly re- </p><p>duce our speed, but our pace is so awful </p><p>that I cannot be sure we can effect this </p><p>in time to avail us. But we have this in </p><p>our favor: the Neutralia, isolated from </p><p>the sun's attraction, will begin to be re- </p><p>pelled at once, so saturated with cold has </p><p>the cover now become; and so near are </p><p>we to Venus that its pull will be very </p><p>strong. Between these two forces, both </p><p>impelling us in the same direction, we </p><p>may be able to manage. We can do no </p><p>more now, just wait,” declared the sci- </p><p>entist impassively. </p><p> Minute by minute the time sped by,</p><p>and still, though with ever lessening ve- </p><p>locity, the Neutralia sped sunward. De- </p><p>spite the asbestos lining, the heat grew </p><p>intense. Slowly the white disk of Venus </p><p>receded. Two hours passed before the </p><p>register pointers came to rest. For a mo- </p><p>ment the globe was hanging motionless. </p><p>Then the pointers again moved; the Neu- </p><p>tralia had commenced its retrograde </p><p>movement back toward Venus, and away </p><p>from the seething cauldron it had been </p><p>heading for. </p><p>THE VOYAGE OF THE NEUTRALIA </p><p>739 </p><p>Relieved from the awful strain of </p><p>•	their former peril, the voyagers</p><p>talked and joked boisterously, </p><p> "Any points of interest about this dame</p><p>Venus?” asked Burgoyne flippantly. </p><p> "Only this known with any certainty.</p><p>Venus lies 24,000,000 miles nearer the </p><p>sun than the earth, her day is forty min- </p><p>utes shorter than ours, and her year only </p><p>224 days long; while her diameter is </p><p>nearly 400 miles less than the earth’s. </p><p>There is an atmosphere of some descrip- </p><p>tion, whether breathable or not we shall </p><p>soon discover. And a few mountains </p><p>have been noted, but little is known of </p><p>the surface. Also she has no moons.” </p><p> "No moons! Thank heaven for that!”</p><p>cried Burgoyne fervently. </p><p> Little by little the reserves of air and</p><p>oxygen sank steadily nearer to exhaus- </p><p>tion. The Neutralia had not yet reached </p><p>the atmosphere of Venus when their cap- </p><p>tain announced the end of the seventh </p><p>hour. Already he spoke, and breathed, </p><p>with much difficulty. "We are very near </p><p>the journey’s end; in ten minutes we shall </p><p>be a mere few miles from the surface of </p><p>Venus. Then either the air is breathable, </p><p>or-” and he left the sentence unfin- </p><p>ished. </p><p> Now the planet loomed gigantic be-</p><p>neath them, blotting out everything save </p><p>its vastness. A pleasant-hued world it </p><p>was, shaded and lit by various markings </p><p>as of land and water, wherever its sur- </p><p>face could be glimpsed between heavy </p><p>cloud masses. It was so near, but so was </p><p>extinction; the last breath of oxygen had </p><p>been released, and in a few moments their </p><p>lungs would be gasping and strangling </p><p>for lack of it. The three friends turned </p><p>dull, fierce eyes on Kobloth; but for him </p><p>the air supply would have been ample </p><p>and to spare. From the start he had been </p><p>their evil genius, and had forced himself </p><p>‘upon them. It was but simple justice that </p><p>he should be sacrificed for the common </p><p>weal, and he had richly earned his fate.</p><p>Burgoyne and Flint staggered toward </p><p>him. Himself gasping and choking, the </p><p>Austrian read his doom in their eyes, </p><p>and shrank away from them. </p><p> At that moment a shrill shriek, that</p><p>rose to a loud roaring, filled the Neu- </p><p>tralia. </p><p> "Stop!” gasped Carscadden. "We are</p><p>in the atmosphere. We land in a min- </p><p>ute!” </p><p> The windows whitened and dulled,</p><p>and ran with steam as the Neutralia fell </p><p>headlong through the damp cloudy lay- </p><p>ers, shrieking and glowing with the last </p><p>remnants of its great pace. Luckily the </p><p>atmosphere of Venus was extensive and </p><p>dense and aided in arresting their descent. </p><p>The roar abated, the windows cleared, </p><p>and a forest of waving tree-tops was vis- </p><p>ible beneath. Then with a terrific jar </p><p>that threatened to loosen every bolt-nut, </p><p>plate, and rivet, the Neutralia struck the </p><p>ground, rocked violently a little, and </p><p>then was at rest. </p><p> "The test-tube!” gasped the scientist</p><p>hoarsely. </p><p> "The door—if we die for it!” choked</p><p>Burgoyne as he swung madly on the </p><p>lever, and before Carscadden could in- </p><p>terfere, Kobloth had staggered to the </p><p>lever also. The great door swung open, </p><p>and a blast of damp, dense air, chilly by </p><p>comparison with the fetid air within the </p><p>globe, but pure as liquid life to the suf- </p><p>focating men, swept upon their faces. </p><p>They breathed in gulping inhalations— </p><p>they breathed and lived! </p><p> You will not want to miss the interest-packed chap-</p><p> ters that bring this story to an end in next month's</p><p> WEIRD TALES.

This lake </p><p>was new to him. It was miles across. He </p><p>did not know its depths and shallows, its </p><p>lily clusters, beds of weeds, or the way it </p><p>responded to squalls. </p><p> The sky had been clear when he started</p><p>out. A deep, rhythmic stroke of the pad- </p><p>dle, and a twist of the blade. Out and </p><p>forward. Down and back again. Each </p><p>time that he brought the paddle astern, </p><p>an expert drag on the blade kept the </p><p>canoe on its straight course. It was a sim- </p><p>ple trick. He could go on for hours, </p><p>stroking steadily on the right, but mid- </p><p>way to his goal, and still unwearied, he </p><p>switched over to the left. </p><p> As often happened in fall along the</p><p>border lakes, a squall was brewing. A </p><p>mass of slate-black clouds bloomed out of </p><p>Canada and swallowed the setting sun. </p><p>He changed his pace, increased the power </p><p>of his thrust and pull, sent the canoe </p><p>skimming more swiftly across the waters. </p><p> The lake, hitherto calm, began to</p><p>spawn groups of nervously racing ripples. </p><p>The wind chased them in all directions </p><p>over the surface. They vanished, and left </p><p>a deceptive tranquillity, until more of the </p><p>uneasy whirls and lines skittered along. </p><p>A swell gradually made its presence, in </p><p>slow undulations, then in an occasional </p><p>small wave that broke, and always higher </p><p>swells, and more strongly marked crests. </p><p> 740</p><p> The water itself, leaf-green at mid-</p><p>afternoon, darkened as the sun disap- </p><p>peared. The green turned to a sodden </p><p>blue, and went down to a dull black. </p><p>And far under that black, four hundred </p><p>feet and more, lay the solid rock that</p><p>formed the deep-gouged bed of all these </p><p>northern lakes. Rock, and the sediment </p><p>of centuries, saturated logs, perhaps the </p><p>wrecks of sunken boats and bodies of </p><p>the drowned for the pike and the mus- </p><p>kellunge to forget. </p><p> Even the stillness had given way to dis-</p><p>turbing sound. The constant, quiet slur </p><p>of waters divided by the canoe became a </p><p>slap, at irregular intervals, and with </p><p>mounting force. The canoe, no longer </p><p>gliding at even balance, began to rise a </p><p>little, dip a little, and the lake smacked </p><p>the fore keel. From the far distance came </p><p>the advance echo of a mighty rushing </p><p>howl. The dark mass of pine and spruce </p><p>that lined the shore, now less than two </p><p>miles ahead, stirred with mournful un- </p><p>rest. The air grew colder. </p><p> During all the summers that Morse</p><p>Calkins had spent canoeing and hunting, </p><p>camping and fishing through the lakes </p><p>and forests of northern Minnesota, he </p><p>had not until now experienced a doubt of </p><p>his mastery. His alarm crept up from his </p><p>heart to his brain because he could not </p><p>account for the apprehension. He had </p><p>been lost in the woods, had rescued him- </p><p>self from a capsized canoe, outdistanced </p><p>forest fires, escaped the charge of a full- </p><p>grown moose. He had survived many a </p><p>squall. Yet the germ of an obscure panic </p><p>haunted him. Less than two miles to the </p><p>UNEASY LIE THE DROWNED </p><p>741 </p><p>camp where the three companions of this </p><p>expedition awaited his arrival. </p><p> There came a lull.</p><p> As though a gigantic, invisible hand</p><p>closed over the canoe, it lost momentum. </p><p> Instantly aware of the drag, he could</p><p>not understand it. None of the possible </p><p>causes that he was familiar with seemed </p><p>adequate reason. A bed of weeds—there </p><p>was no shallow here, only bottom hun- </p><p>dreds of feet down. An added weight—■ </p><p>he had not yet shipped water. The pres- </p><p>sure of wind—the wind blew fitfully, not </p><p>steadily, not enough to retard him. A </p><p>drift of current—perhaps, but currents </p><p>were more common to rivers than lakes. </p><p>The canoe lagged further. His senses, </p><p>alert to every mood of the craft, </p><p>warned him of pressure astern. For some </p><p>strange, incomprehensible motive, he kept </p><p>his eyes glued on the dark forest and the </p><p>black mountains of clouds ahead. The </p><p>prow of the canoe tilted upward higher </p><p>than it should rise to crest a wave. </p><p> He stroked suddenly, deeply, the mus-</p><p>cles knotting at his shoulders, and the </p><p>veins rising on his arms, while his </p><p>knuckles stood out in naked, bony lumps. </p><p> The canoe slowed to a standstill. The</p><p>bow rode still higher. All his strength </p><p>and power, his hardest paddling, could </p><p>not move the canoe. He saw the sweat </p><p>seep from wrinkles at his wrist, but the </p><p>swart hairs were half erect. Odd. Hot </p><p>and cold—he couldn’t be both. </p><p> Morse turned and glared all at once,</p><p>as if expecting to find someone else in </p><p>the canoe, someone to curse. </p><p> There was no one else in the canoe—</p><p>yet. But there was a hand clutching the </p><p>stem, and the fingers of another hand </p><p>crawled into sight, sliding over the rim. </p><p>Morse watched them with an expression </p><p>of detachment. It was almost a silly ex- </p><p>pression, for the anesthetic of shock had </p><p>paralyzed him in one instantaneous flood. </p><p> A pair of hands—well, why not? A</p><p>swimmer whom he hadn’t noticed—or </p><p>the exhausted survivor from a boat that </p><p>had foundered—but the hands wouldn’t </p><p>have inched their way up with so stealthy </p><p>an approach. These thoughts floated </p><p>vaguely somewhere in back of his reeling </p><p>consciousness. No swimmer, no living </p><p>human being, ever possessed hands of </p><p>such soapy fatness. </p><p> They slid along the side, those plump,</p><p>bloated fingers, and found a grip. He </p><p>couldn’t make out a trace of knuckles or </p><p>joints or veins. The nails were entirely </p><p>missing. Only thick coils remained, like </p><p>enormously pudgy, gray-white worms. </p><p> Above the stern rose a tangle of hair.</p><p>It was wet, matted. Then the forehead </p><p>and eyes and face, except that of these </p><p>there existed only a swollen, fissured </p><p>blob, the features of one drowned and </p><p>immersed for months. </p><p> To Morse, it seemed that his arms and</p><p>legs would never carry out his command, </p><p>that his body drifted through lazy ges- </p><p>tures akin to a slow-motion picture. Yet </p><p>he found himself bringing the oar blade </p><p>down again and again on those horrific </p><p>hands. He was not aware of having made </p><p>a mad lunge forward that almost capsized </p><p>his craft, or of whirling around and lift- </p><p>ing the oar above his head. Only his </p><p>hammering upon the fingers and head of </p><p>the corpse, there in all that tumult of </p><p>wind and waters, formed a positive </p><p>reality. </p><p> He could not pound or pry them loose.</p><p> The lips curled around the distended,</p><p>protruding tongue—an illusion bred of </p><p>darkness and terror. It couldn’t be. Nor </p><p>the gasped whistle of an inarticulate at- </p><p>tempt at speech, like the hiss of steam </p><p>escaping. He didn’t hear it. He couldn't </p><p>hear it above the rumble and boom of </p><p>thunder. </p><p> Thunder—of course. In the old days,</p><p>cannon had been fired to roil quiet waters </p><p>742 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>and bring to the surface bodies of the </p><p>drowned. The thunder, the roaring, re- </p><p>verberating claps and wild wind over the </p><p>lake had raised this dead thing from its </p><p>lodging. The rest w^as imagination. </p><p>Mustn’t let his nerves go. </p><p> He heard a husky, gurgling rattle.</p><p>Once he had listened to a dying soldier </p><p>whose message bubbled away upon the </p><p>bullets that had punctured his lungs. </p><p>This was a sound more appalling, be- </p><p>cause of its deliberation, and the words </p><p>choked on the wind, "Don’t, Morse. I </p><p>came up to see you. I had to see you. I </p><p>was Pete LeRoy.” </p><p> Morse didn’t know that he shouted.</p><p>There was frenzy in his voice. It rode the </p><p>storm. "Go back where you came from! </p><p>I don’t care who you are! I’ve got to </p><p>make camp—a storm’s coming up—get </p><p>away from here, damn you! Why don’t </p><p>you go back?” </p><p> The oar thudded, slipped off those fat</p><p>fingers. Morse wondered what insane im- </p><p>pulse drove him to talk aloud. You can’t </p><p>talk to the drowned. </p><p> "I can’t go back, Morse. I’ve got to</p><p>know you. I’ve got to talk to you. I had </p><p>to come up. You see, my canoe sank and </p><p>I drowned-” </p><p> "No! No! Go down where you be-</p><p>long!” Was that crazed babble his? </p><p>What made him answer ghost-words </p><p>that he dreamed? </p><p> "I will, but not yet. I drowned by ac-</p><p>cident, Morse. It shouldn’t have hap- </p><p>pened. I wasn’t prepared. I hadn’t lived </p><p>as long as I was supposed to. I ought to </p><p>have gone on living. If I had, I’d have </p><p>met you. I’d have become a friend of </p><p>yours. We would have made plans to- </p><p>gether. We would have seen a lot of each </p><p>other.” </p><p> The thick, blurry speech submerged</p><p>the gusts that now began to lash the ris- </p><p>ing waters. Morse wished that the gale </p><p>would scream down a million-fold louder </p><p>and blast into oblivion those corrupt </p><p>w’ords and that hoarse voice. </p><p>Morse panted—and he himself found </p><p>time to doubt if he made such soft, </p><p>persuasive answer — "I don’t want to </p><p>know you, whatever you are.” </p><p> "But I want to know you, Morse Cal-</p><p>kins. You see, if I hadn’t drowned </p><p>months ago—w'as it months? I don’t re- </p><p>member. Time doesn’t mean anything to </p><p>me now. If I hadn’t drowned, if I had </p><p>managed to -get across the lake safely, </p><p>I’d have known you well by now. So </p><p>when I felt you pass over me, something </p><p>tugged me. You pulled me up where I </p><p>could see you-” </p><p> "No! No! I didn’t have anything to</p><p>do with it! Get back!” </p><p> "Oh yes, you did, Morse. You com-</p><p>pelled me to come up. Pete LeRoy—you </p><p>never heard the name before, did you?” </p><p> "I don’t want to hear it again. Let me</p><p>go. I’ve got to reach camp before the </p><p>storm breaks at its worst. Why don’t you </p><p>just let go and drop back?” </p><p> "I will, but not yet. I have something</p><p>to do that I didn’t have time to do when </p><p>I was Pete LeRoy and living. I’m dead </p><p>now. Maybe I’m not Pete LeRoy. But </p><p>the part of me that remembers Pete Le- </p><p>Roy knows w'hat he would have done if </p><p>he’d kept on living. That part of me felt </p><p>you coming over the surface of the lake. </p><p>I had to rise up. I had to come as I am, </p><p>and I’m here as I am, because there’s a </p><p>mission I’ve got to carry out. It’s the </p><p>same mission that I couldn’t carry out </p><p>when I drowned, but that I must have </p><p>carried out if I’d gone on living.” </p><p> Morse was hitting, slashing, jabbing</p><p>again with the oar. The flat of the blade </p><p>struck the monstrous head with sickening, </p><p>mushy thuds. He pried at the rotten fin- </p><p>gers, but they slid along the side and </p><p>UNEASY LIE THE DROWNED </p><p>i743 </p><p>clung as though glued to the withes. He </p><p>was breathing harshly. The spray that </p><p>had begun to blow made his own hands </p><p>slippery, and glistened wetly on the gray- </p><p>white thing at the stern. </p><p> "Please,” Morse said thickly, and</p><p>again, "Go away, go down,” and then </p><p>suddenly his voice went screeching up to </p><p>a high, thin crescendo, "Let go, damn </p><p>you! You’re dead and drowned! Get </p><p>down and rot where you belong!” </p><p> The fingers, bashed into loathsome</p><p>pulp by the blows from the oar, curled </p><p>over like talons. What was left of Pete </p><p>LeRoy said in the same guttural drawl </p><p>as before, "Yes, Morse, I’ll go when I’ve </p><p>accomplished my mission. I’ve got to go </p><p>down where I belong, then. I haven’t </p><p>told you why I came. Don’t you want to </p><p>know?” </p><p> "You said you had to see me. You’ve</p><p>seen me. Isn’t that enough? Are you go- </p><p>ing to hang on till Doomsday?” </p><p> "Don’t you know why I came? What</p><p>my mission is?” </p><p> "For God’s sake, let go!” Morse’s</p><p>voice was getting raw. His howl ended </p><p>on a sort of piping whistle. His eyes </p><p>were beginning to glare. He had for- </p><p>gotten the storm. He didn’t realize how </p><p>dark it had become, how blackness came </p><p>rushing across the lake to merge with the </p><p>rioting waters. His whole world had </p><p>narrowed to those pulpy hands and the </p><p>fat, featureless face that lay under the </p><p>tangle of hair. </p><p> The horrible voice gurgled again, with</p><p>a noise of drowning, a rattle of death. </p><p>"It’s a strange destiny that drives me, </p><p>Morse. I don’t understand it any more </p><p>than you do. Sometimes I think I almost </p><p>know. Then it slips away from me. In </p><p>the life that I should have lived, I would </p><p>be here now to kill you.” </p><p> "To—to—kill-” Morse choked.</p><p>There was a gagging in his throat that </p><p>he couldn’t gulp away.</p><p> "Yes, to kill you. You see, Morse, if</p><p>I’d gone on living my natural life, I’d </p><p>have got to know you. We’d have been </p><p>friends for a while. And then we’d have </p><p>quarreled and turned bitter enemies. </p><p>We’d have hated each other as much as </p><p>we liked each other before. But we’d </p><p>have tried to suppress our hatred, be- </p><p>cause we’d have been on this long camp- </p><p>ing-trip. And then today we’d have start- </p><p>ed across this lake, and our hatred would </p><p>have flared into the open, and you’d have </p><p>made a dive for me, and I’d have knocked </p><p>you overboard and paddled away, leaving </p><p>you to drown. </p><p> "It’s you who should have gone down,</p><p>Morse Calkins, and I who should have </p><p>gone on living.” </p><p>The slow, creepy speech died away. </p><p>Morse saw tiny rivers running down </p><p>the face and the hands from the torrents </p><p>of rain that now deluged the lake. The </p><p>wind had stormed up to a gale, and the </p><p>waves had begun to crash in foaming </p><p>white-caps. Into the dips dropped the </p><p>canoe, and slid up the six-foot crests, and </p><p>shipped the breaking spume. </p><p> Morse lurched drunkenly. His eyes</p><p>felt like flaming coals. His hair was plas- </p><p>tered to his scalp. Streams of rain trickled </p><p>down his face, sloshed down his back, </p><p>squished into his boots. </p><p> The gray-white visitor bobbed with the</p><p>rise and fall of the canoe. The soft, fat </p><p>hands did not relinquish their grip. The </p><p>dead, decaying head stayed always at the </p><p>stern. </p><p> With a cry that was more like a hoarse</p><p>bleat, Morse dived for the fingers, yam- </p><p>mering as he tried to pull them loose. </p><p>Their touch was a dreadful sensation that </p><p>made him gag in crazed horror. He beat </p><p>744 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>and pounded them while the rain glis- </p><p>tened like tears on his yellow face. </p><p> The double weight on the stern stood</p><p>the canoe straight on end as it started to </p><p>mount a roaring white-cap. It plunged </p><p>beneath the surface. Morse pitched out. </p><p>The pudgy hands, oddly, seemed to be </p><p>clinging to his. And then they had some- </p><p>how enfolded him and he was beating </p><p>frenziedly at something that had long </p><p>been pulp. </p><p> His last upward glance showed him</p><p>only raging blackness and the drive of </p><p>rain. </p><p> He was still fighting when the waters</p><p>closed over his head. </p><p>UheQf </p><p>JSseen Eyes and Ears </p><p>* </p><p>of Kara Kedi </p><p>By CLAUDE FARRERE </p><p>An odd little story about a cat that was telepathic—by a member </p><p>of the French Academy </p><p>January 13, 1937 </p><p>I HAVE been writing all the evening, </p><p>alone in my room, alone in my little </p><p>house in the uncomprehending city </p><p>of Toulon, the lonely refuge I have crept </p><p>into to get away from the world. When </p><p>a man tires himself out, when he takes </p><p>too strenuous a part in the various pain- </p><p>ful agitations of active life, he growls old </p><p>rapidly. I have not yet lived fifty years </p><p>on this earth, but my hair is white and </p><p>my thoughts are as gray as ashes. . . . </p><p> I am writing in my room, all alone.</p><p>Alone in a sense, that is.

He and I spend a great deal of </p><p>time together in these great, heavy twin </p><p>chairs, upholstered in tan velvet. My</p><p>black cat’s name is Kara Kedi, which is </p><p>Turkish for just that—I mean, for "black </p><p> • Translated by Roy Temple House.</p><p>cat.” I didn’t waste a great deal of </p><p>imagination in naming him. Kara Kedi </p><p>was born in Turkey, at Stamboul, in the </p><p>holy suburb of Eyoub. That was back </p><p>in the days when I was deep in love with </p><p>the Circassian girl. Ah, how blond her </p><p>hair was, and how brown her skin was! </p><p>And how sweet her kisses were! </p><p> But there is no burning passion in my</p><p>cottage tonight. Kara Kedi’s chair is </p><p>comfortable, and he sleeps very soundly, </p><p>so that I am really alone in my room, </p><p>alone in my dreary little house. </p><p> My little house is a gimcrack of a</p><p>place, with a little garden that runs all </p><p>around it. To the right and left are little </p><p>gardens very much like mine, about tiny </p><p>little houses very much like mine. My </p><p>neighbor on the right is a very dirty, </p><p>very polite, and very deaf old sailor. My </p><p>neighbor on the left is a pretty little </p><p>young woman, very charming and very </p><p>candid, who is constantly laughing and </p><p>THE KEEN EYES AND EARS OF KARA KEDI </p><p>745 </p><p>rattling her bracelets, as she gambols </p><p>about in her sunny little garden. She has </p><p>a great many friends, all of them gentle- </p><p>men, and I am afraid they do not all </p><p>come merely for the sake of a look at her </p><p>pretty face and the pleasure of hearing </p><p>her silvery voice. But of course it isn’t </p><p>any affair of mine what they come for. </p><p>And they are reasonably quiet about it, </p><p>so that I scarcely know when they come </p><p>and go. </p><p> At night, our part of the city is abso-</p><p>lutely quiet. It is so still at night that </p><p>even when the sea is calm I can hear it </p><p>lapping lazily against the rocks. For the </p><p>sea is not many feet away from me. I </p><p>could see it from my windows, if my win- </p><p>dows were not so low. But as it is, the </p><p>cabins of the fishermen’s families hide </p><p>the sea away from me. </p><p> But tonight, for some reason or other,</p><p>I can’t hear a sound of any sort, not even </p><p>the caressing whispers of the waves. It </p><p>is too calm even for that. There is not </p><p>a hint of a breeze in the air, not a ripple </p><p>on the surface of the sea. The winds </p><p>and the waves are asleep, quite as soundly </p><p>asleep as Kara Kedi, my black cat. </p><p> Kara Kedi, in his velvet-upholstered</p><p>armchair, is as completely motionless as </p><p>if he were cast in bronze. I can’t see his </p><p>paws or his tail, or the exact shape of his </p><p>head. He is rolled up into a tightish ball, </p><p>with a soft outline of ink-colored fur. </p><p>Kara Kedi is an enormous cat. I think </p><p>he is probably the biggest cat I ever saw. </p><p>You could scarcely call him fat. He is </p><p>not one of those round, formless cats </p><p>you see sometimes, who doze day and </p><p>night because they have more fat flesh </p><p>than they have energy. He is longer, </p><p>larger-boned, taller on his feet, than the </p><p>ordinary house-cat. When he crosses my </p><p>garden, gravely, gracefully, but with un- </p><p>mistakable evidence of personality and </p><p>power, to meditate in the branches of the </p><p>great fig-tree at the end of my garden, </p><p>my little neighbor on the left says he </p><p>makes her nervous. She tells me that she </p><p>is almost afraid of him, and since her </p><p>zoological attainments are not extensive</p><p>enough to include black panthers, she </p><p>reproachfully calls him a big awful bear. </p><p>I am writing at this journal of mine . . . </p><p>there is a great feeling of calmness </p><p>and peace about me in the room and in </p><p>the house ... in the garden, and in all </p><p>the quiet night that reaches out be- </p><p>yond. . . . </p><p> I discover that my pen is empty. I</p><p>raise my head and reach out my hand, </p><p>for the inkwell ... Ah! Kara Kedi is </p><p>not asleep any longer. His head has sud- </p><p>denly emerged from the placid ball of </p><p>dark fur. His head moves upward and </p><p>forward, and his glaring eyes fix them- </p><p>selves on the dim rectangle of the win- </p><p>dow. And I can see that his pointed </p><p>ears have turned straight upward. He is </p><p>listening with all his might. </p><p> "Kara Kedi, old fellow, is there some-</p><p>thing wrong out beyond that window?’’ </p><p> Kara Kedi is still motionless and si-</p><p>lent. But I can see his ears twitch, in a </p><p>gesture that tells me he has heard me, </p><p>but implores me to be quiet. He is right. </p><p>There is no reason why I should distract </p><p>his attention from the faint and distant </p><p>noises which may mean much, by the </p><p>noisy futilities of human speech. . . . </p><p> They do mean much, I am sure of that.</p><p>Something is wrong, mysteriously wrong. </p><p>Kara Kedi rises upright on his four long, </p><p>strong legs, his head held straight for- </p><p>ward and his long tail standing straight </p><p>out behind him. He has disdained the </p><p>thousand-year tradition of cats awakened </p><p>from a nap. He has not stopped to arch </p><p>his back, to yawn, to stretch himself mag- </p><p>nificently. There must be something </p><p>ominous in the air, or at least it must </p><p>746 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>seem ominous to Kara Kedi . . . perhaps </p><p>it might seem less so to me. . . . </p><p> It is a serious matter in Kara Kedi's</p><p>opinion; there is no longer any doubt </p><p>about that! Kara Kedi descends from the </p><p>armchair and walks toward the window. </p><p>He walks resolutely, determinedly, like a </p><p>strong nature meeting a crisis. When he </p><p>left his chair, he did not leap down from </p><p>the chair to the floor. He lengthened </p><p>himself out, muscle after muscle, until he </p><p>touched the floor with one paw, then </p><p>with a second, then with a third, and a </p><p>fourth. ... I realize perfectly by this </p><p>time that I must maintain an absolute </p><p>silence. Kara Kedi’s head moves for- </p><p>ward till his nose touches the strangely </p><p>disquieting window-pane. Then, very </p><p>slowly, the great body swings around </p><p>till it faces toward the wall which lay to </p><p>the animal’s left before. My windows </p><p>are so low that I can see the great pan- </p><p>ther-profile now, standing out rather dis- </p><p>tinctly against the faint light of the win- </p><p>dow. I should not be able to see him so </p><p>distinctly if the animal’s hair had not </p><p>suddenly risen to a perpendicular all over </p><p>his body and begun, as I had seen it do </p><p>once or twice before on very stormy days, </p><p>to emit a myriad of tiny crackling electric </p><p>sparks. </p><p> "Kara Kedi! Kitty! What’s the mat-</p><p>ter with you?” </p><p> "Miaul”</p><p> It was not Kara Kedi’s usual "miau”</p><p>of inquiry, petition or complaint; it was </p><p>merely an expression of impatience. Kara </p><p>Kedi, so courteous on most occasions, is </p><p>nervously irritated at my foolish prattle. </p><p>I accept his rebuke, in all meekness. I </p><p>shall not breathe another sound. </p><p> Kara Kedi’s eyes are fixed on that left</p><p>wall with glaring insistence. The eyes are </p><p>two green flames of dazzling glory. All at </p><p>once the great feline turns his head and </p><p>gazes at me, and—it sounds supremely </p><p>foolish—and I am unable to ward off a </p><p>feeling of superstitious, dazed terror. I </p><p>am as sure as Kara Kedi is that something</p><p>ghastly is happening out beyond that </p><p>wall. It is a feeling, nothing more. There </p><p>is no trace of rational knowledge. . . . </p><p> Kara Kedi, phosphorescent from his</p><p>tail to his mustache, moves entirely away </p><p>from the window. Then he begins to </p><p>creep straight along that left wall, as if </p><p>he were following, step by step, some un- </p><p>known being which moved or was moved </p><p>slowly along on the other side of the </p><p>wall. Kara Kedi is making no apparent </p><p>use of his sense of smell. He is listen- </p><p>ing with all the intense keenness of his </p><p>ears, and he is looking, looking with all </p><p>his eyes. . . . The wall is covered widi </p><p>a plain gray paper, and I can’t remember </p><p>ever to have seen anything on that wall </p><p>or that paper which had anything unusual </p><p>about it. . . . </p><p> Oh—oh!</p><p> Kara Kedi draws himself together,</p><p>and with all the power of his marvelous </p><p>muscles he flings himself backward into </p><p>the room, away from the wall. He runs </p><p>around in a bewildered circle, his tail </p><p>thrust out perfectly stiff. He looks this </p><p>way and that for a place to flee to. I can </p><p>see that he is driven by blind and agoniz- </p><p>ing terror. He is so troubled that his </p><p>mind and his memory are not function- </p><p>ing; he has forgotten that I am there to </p><p>guard and protect him as I have done </p><p>so many times before. It is only after a </p><p>long period of anguish and dashing </p><p>madly hither and thither, that his dazed </p><p>eyes chance to meet mine. The message </p><p>of my presence reaches his poor fuddled </p><p>brain at last. And suddenly, like an ani- </p><p>mal hunted for prey, he flings himself </p><p>tow'ard me, he leaps to my knees, but he </p><p>does not stop there. He crawls deep into </p><p>my arms, up against my breast. He buries </p><p>his head between my neck and my </p><p>shoulder, but he is unable to resist the </p><p>wretched fascination that keeps drawing </p><p>THE KEEN EYES AND EARS OF KARA KEDI </p><p>747 </p><p>his eyes toward that miserable wall, that </p><p>wall of pain and horror. </p><p> And his trouble has taken possession</p><p>of me. The frightened cat has driven his </p><p>fear into the very marrow of my bones. </p><p>I am paralyzed with craven foreboding. </p><p>Like the cat, I am unable to move my </p><p>eyes from the mysterious gray wall, the </p><p>wall which is hiding from me some </p><p>blood-curdling happening that I have not </p><p>the courage to try to imagine. Kara Kedi </p><p>trembles and shivers in the protecting </p><p>grasp of my two cold hands. Then sud- </p><p>denly an even more terrible thing </p><p>happens. </p><p> Kara Kedi tears himself free from my</p><p>embrace, drops from my knees, leaps </p><p>into the air three or four times and falls </p><p>to the floor in violent convulsions. His </p><p>throat is torn by raucous cries, cries </p><p>which are no more like the familiar </p><p>miauing of his normal life than the sin- </p><p>ister gurglings of an epileptic in the </p><p>midst of a seizure are like the healtiiy </p><p>human voice. . . . </p><p># ■* * * * </p><p> I think I suffered a temporary period</p><p>of derangement. I have a feverish recol- </p><p>lection that I seized my revolver and </p><p>stood a long time with the weapon </p><p>pointed at the ominous wall, waiting for </p><p>the wall to open and admit some shape </p><p>of terror. . . . </p><p>Jan. 14. </p><p>MY poor, pretty young neighbor, the </p><p>giddy little person of accommo- </p><p>dating virtue whose bracelets rattled so </p><p>gayly in her sunny garden, is dead. They </p><p>found her body this morning. </p><p> Nobody has the slightest inkling of</p><p>what the motive of the crime may have </p><p>been. The assassin docs not appear to </p><p>have taken anything. The poor little </p><p>corpse still wears all its gaudy jewelry. </p><p>Nor was there any sign of a struggle or </p><p>of violence. An extraordinarily long </p><p>gold pin, an ornament but a deadly</p><p>weapon at need, was found driven into </p><p>her body below the fifth rib. And the </p><p>eyes of the dead woman, wide open and </p><p>staring, are dilated with a horror that is </p><p>one of the most dreadful things I have </p><p>ever seen. </p><p> Everybody is mystified. Nobody saw</p><p>anything, nobody heard anything. It is </p><p>likely that the mystery will never be </p><p>solved. Till the body was found, nobody </p><p>had any suspicion that anything was </p><p>wrong. </p><p> Nobody, that is, but Kara Kedi—Kara</p><p>Kedi and I. </p><p> Kara Kedi followed me over when I</p><p>went into the little cottage to look at the </p><p>body. He glanced carelessly at the pathetic </p><p>little corpse; then he looked away. It ap- </p><p>pears that dead people have no particular </p><p>interest for Kara Kedi. But he did look </p><p>at me again, with a strange earnest </p><p>expression in his eyes. </p><p> Then he walked out of the open door,</p><p>crossed the garden pensively, and moved </p><p>out on a branch of the great fig-tree to </p><p>meditate. To meditate — perhaps to </p><p>ruminate his memories. </p><p>ragment </p><p> By ROBERT E.

All through the long hellish </p><p>hours of blackness it shines there. And </p><p>in the autumn of the year, when the </p><p>winds from the north curse and whine, </p><p>and the red-leaved trees of the swamp </p><p>mutter things to one another in the small </p><p>hours of the morning under the horned </p><p>waning moon, I sit by the casement and </p><p>watch that star. Down from the heights </p><p>reels the glittering Cassiopeia as the hours </p><p>wear on, while Charles’ Wain lumbers </p><p>up from behind the vapor-soaked swamp </p><p>trees that sway in the night wind. Just </p><p>before dawn Arcturus winks ruddily from </p><p>above the cemetcry on the low hillock, </p><p>and Coma Berenices shimmers weirdly </p><p>afar off in the mysterious east; but still </p><p>the Pole Star leers down from the same </p><p>place in the black vault, w'inking hid- </p><p>eously like an insane watching eye which </p><p>strives to convey some strange message, </p><p>yet recalls nothing save that it once had </p><p>a message to convey. Sometimes, when </p><p>it is cloudy, I can sleep. </p><p> Well do I remember the night of the</p><p>great aurora, when over the swamp </p><p>played the shocking coruscations of the </p><p>demon light. After the beam came </p><p>clouds, and then I slept. </p><p> And it was under a horned waning</p><p>moon that I saw the city for the first </p><p>time. Still and somnolent did it lie, on a </p><p>strange plateau in a hollow betwixt </p><p>strange peaks. Of ghastly marble were </p><p>its walls and its towers, its columns, </p><p>domes, and pavements. In the marble </p><p>streets were marble pillars, the upper </p><p>parts of which were carven into the </p><p>images of grave bearded men. The air </p><p>was warm and stirred not. And overhead, </p><p>scarce ten degrees from the zenith, </p><p>glowed that watching Pole Star. </p><p> Long did I gaze on the city, but the</p><p>day came not. When the red Aldebaran, </p><p>which blinked low in the sky but never </p><p>set, had crawled on a quarter of the way</p><p>around the horizon, I saw light and mo- </p><p>tion in the houses and the streets. Forms </p><p>strangely robed, but at once noble and </p><p>familiar, walked abroad, and under the </p><p>horned waning moon men talked wisdom </p><p>in a tongue which I understood, though </p><p>it was unlike any language I had ever </p><p>known. And when the red Aldebaran </p><p>had crawled more than half-way around </p><p>the horizon, there were again darkness </p><p>and silence. </p><p> When I waked, I was not as I had</p><p>been. Upon my memory was graven the </p><p>vision of the city, and within my soul had </p><p>arisen another and vaguer recollection, of </p><p>whose nature I was not then certain. </p><p>Thereafter, on the cloudy nights when I </p><p>could sleep, I saw the city often; some- </p><p>times under the hot, yellow rays of a sun </p><p>which did not set, but which wheeled low </p><p>around the horizon. And on the clear </p><p>nights the Pole Star leered as never be- </p><p>fore. </p><p> Gradually I came to wonder what</p><p>might be my place in that city on the </p><p>strange plateau betwixt strange peaks. </p><p> 749</p><p>750 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>At first content to view the scene as an </p><p>all-observant uncorporeal presence, I now </p><p>desired to define my relation to it, and to </p><p>speak my mind amongst the grave men </p><p>who conversed each day in the public </p><p>squares. I said to myself, "This is no </p><p>dream, for by what means can I prove the </p><p>greater reality of that other life in the </p><p>house of stone and brick south of the sin- </p><p>ister swamp and the cemetery on the low </p><p>hillock, where the Pole Star peeps into </p><p>my north window each night?” </p><p>One night as I listened to the dis- </p><p>course in the large square contain- </p><p>ing many statues, I felt a change; and per- </p><p>ceived that I had at last a bodily form. </p><p>Nor was I a stranger in the streets of </p><p>Olathoe, which lies on the plateau of Sar- </p><p>kia, betwixt the peaks of Noton and </p><p>Kadiphonck. It was my friend Alos who </p><p>spoke, and his speech was one that </p><p>pleased my soul, for it was the speech of </p><p>a true man and patriot. That night had </p><p>the news come of Daikos’ fall, and of the </p><p>advance of the Inutos; squat, hellish yel- </p><p>low fiends who five years ago had ap- </p><p>peared out of the unknown west to ravage </p><p>the confines of our kingdom, and many </p><p>to besiege our towns. Having taken the </p><p>fortified places at the foot of the moun- </p><p>tains, their way now lay open to the pla- </p><p>teau, unless every citizen could resist with </p><p>the strength of ten men. For the squat </p><p>creatures were mighty in the arts of war, </p><p>and knew not the scruples of honor which </p><p>held back our tall, gray-eyed men of Lo- </p><p>mar from ruthless conquest. </p><p> Alos, my friend, was commander of all</p><p>the forces on the plateau, and in him lay </p><p>the last hope of our country. On this oc- </p><p>casion he spoke of the perils to be faced, </p><p>and exhorted the men of Olathoe, bravest </p><p>of the Lomarians, to sustain the traditions </p><p>of their ancestors, who when forced to </p><p>move southward from Zobna before the </p><p>advance of the great ice sheet (even as </p><p>our descendants must some day flee from </p><p>the land of Lomar), valiantly and victori- </p><p>ously swept aside the hairy, long-armed, </p><p>cannibal Gnophkehs that stood in their </p><p>way. To me Alos denied a warrior’s part, </p><p>for I was feeble and given to strange</p><p>faintings when subjected to stress and </p><p>hardships. But my eyes were the keenest </p><p>in the city, despite the long hours I gave </p><p>each day to the study of the Pnakotic </p><p>manuscripts and the wisdom of the Zob- </p><p>narian Fathers; so my friend, desiring not </p><p>to doom me to inaction, rewarded me </p><p>with that duty which was second to noth- </p><p>ing in importance. To the watch-tower of </p><p>Thapnen he sent me, there to serve as the </p><p>eyes of our army. Should the Inutos at- </p><p>tempt to gain the citadel by the narrow </p><p>pass behind the peak Noton and thereby </p><p>surprize the garrison, I was to give the </p><p>signal of fire which would warn the wait- </p><p>ing soldiers and save the town from im*. </p><p>mediate disaster. </p><p> Alone I mounted the tower, for every</p><p>man of stout body was needed in the </p><p>passes below. My brain was sore dazed </p><p>with excitement and fatigue, for I had </p><p>not slept in many days; yet was my pur- </p><p>pose firm, for I loved my native land of </p><p>Lomar, and the marble city Olathoe that </p><p>lies betwixt the peaks of Noton and Kadi- </p><p>phonek. </p><p> But as I stood in the tower’s topmost</p><p>chamber, I beheld the horned waning </p><p>moon, red and sinister, quivering through </p><p>the vapors that hovered over the distant </p><p>valley of Banof. And through an open- </p><p>ing in the roof glittered the pale Pole </p><p>Star, fluttering as if alive, and leering like </p><p>a fiend and tempter. Methought its spirit </p><p>whispered evil counsel, soothing me to </p><p>traitorous somnolence with a damnable </p><p>rhythmical promise which it repeated over </p><p>and over: </p><p>POLARIS </p><p>751 </p><p> Slumber, watcher, till the spheres,</p><p> Six and twenty thousand years</p><p> Have revolv’d, and I return</p><p> To the spot where now I burn.</p><p> Other stars anon shall rise</p><p> To the axis of the skies;</p><p> Stars that soothe and stars that bless</p><p> With a sweet forgetfulness:</p><p> Only when my round is o’er</p><p> Shall the past disturb thy door.</p><p> Vainly did I struggle with my drowsi-</p><p>ness, seeking to connect these strange </p><p>words with some lore of the skies which </p><p>I had learned from the Pnakotic manu- </p><p>scripts. My head, heavy and reeling, </p><p>drooped to my breast, and when next I </p><p>looked up it was in a dream; with the </p><p>Pole Star grinning at me through a win- </p><p>dow from over the horrible swaying trees </p><p>of a dream swamp. And I am still dream- </p><p>ing. </p><p> In my shame and despair I sometimes</p><p>scream frantically, begging the dream- </p><p>creatures around me to waken me ere the </p><p>Inutos steal up the pass behind the peak </p><p>Noton and take the citadel by surprize; </p><p>but these creatures are demons, for they </p><p>laugh at me and tell me I am not dream- </p><p>ing. They mock me whilst I sleep, and </p><p>whilst the squat yellow foe may be creep- </p><p>ing silently upon us. I have failed in my </p><p>duty and betrayed the marble city of Ola- </p><p>thoe; I have proven false to Alos, my </p><p>friend and commander. But still these </p><p>shadows of my dreams deride me. They </p><p>say there is no land of Lomar, save in my </p><p>nocturnal imaginings; that in these </p><p>realms where the Pole Star shines high, </p><p>and red Aldebaran crawls low around the </p><p>horizon, there has been naught save ice </p><p>and snow for thousands of years, and </p><p>never a man save squat, yellow creatures, </p><p>blighted by the cold, whom they call </p><p>Eskimos. </p><p> And as I writhe in my guilty agony,</p><p>frantic to save the city whose peril every </p><p>moment grows, and vainly striving to</p><p>(Please turn to page 739) </p><p>By BASSETT MORGAN </p><p>S THE little trading-schooner drew	strangely repellent.

The </p><p>article was illustrated by a cartoon of Pro- </p><p>fessor Denham and Chueng Ching, a </p><p>Chinese student who was his especial </p><p>protege and devoted to Denham, in the </p><p>coils of a serpent labeled "Public Opin- </p><p>ion,” depicting the agony of the Laocoon. </p><p>There was the account of class experi- </p><p>ments in transplanting the brain of one </p><p>rat to the head of another, and of the </p><p>practical joke perpetrated by a student </p><p>assistant in substituting the brain of-a fe- </p><p>male rat for that of a male, which led to </p><p>riotous speculation on the campus as to </p><p>the outcome of the experiment. </p><p> Willoughby had been sorry for Pro-</p><p>fessor Denham. It was, however, the </p><p>three thousand dollars salary that decided </p><p>him to accept Denham’s offer and take </p><p>the next steamer from San Francisco east, </p><p>re-embarking on a trading-schooner for </p><p>Papua, and Denham was to send a boat to </p><p>take him to his own habitation. </p><p> The letter, which he re-read within</p><p>sight of landing, had emphasized the ne- </p><p>cessity of "a strong fearless man, with- </p><p>out nerves.” Willoughby interpreted the </p><p>phrase with a new meaning, now that he </p><p>recognized the repellent fascination of </p><p>Papua. </p><p> He had no sooner stepped ashore than</p><p>a Chinese in oil-stained dungarees ap- </p><p>proached him and spoke: </p><p> "You allee samee Mista Will’bee, you</p><p>come ’long my boat.” </p><p> He had scant time to bid farewell to</p><p>his acquaintances of the trading-vessel </p><p>when he was led to a launch lying on </p><p>water so clear that she seemed to be float- </p><p>ing on air. Her propeller churned foam </p><p>and she careened a little as they rounded </p><p>the point; then for hours the launch raced </p><p>along the coast, where jungles brooded </p><p>and river mouths showed no banks, but </p><p>only trees rooted in swamp. Fighting a </p><p>loneliness he could not analyze, Willough- </p><p>by watched sea gardens beneath and tried </p><p>to reason away a lowering depression. </p><p>The Chinese ignored his tentative ap- </p><p>proaches to conversation by unbroken and </p><p>stoical silence. </p><p> In the late afternoon, with her engines</p><p>slowed to half-speed, the launch entered </p><p>a lagoon, where echoes of her pulsations </p><p>disturbed boobies on the wreck of an old </p><p>ship pronged on coral spurs. The lagoon </p><p>water held gaudy little fish scattering like </p><p>sparks between skeleton-white roots of </p><p>drowned trees. Sea life had made the </p><p>wreck its prey. White decay crept up her </p><p>sides and she wras rooted to abysmal </p><p>depths by weeds. A small wharf sagged </p><p>under forest creepers with tendrils trail- </p><p>ing in the sea. The planks creaked alarm- </p><p>ingly as Willoughby trod them following </p><p>the boatman, and met the shrill hum of </p><p>insects. The heat was like a furnace blast. </p><p>He was aware of a throb like tic-doulou- </p><p>reux pulsing incessantly, as if on distant </p><p>hills the heat had a voice. </p><p> What had once been a path leading</p><p>from the wharf was now overgrown. The </p><p>Chinese, lathered with sweat, slashed </p><p>with a knife at trailing vines. Orchids </p><p>quivered like flames. The incessant hum </p><p>of insects rose in loud crescendo, but as </p><p>they progressed the trail became less con- </p><p> W. T.—7</p><p>LAOCOON </p><p>753 </p><p>fused with looped lianas. Sunlight fil- </p><p>tered through brandies overhead. And </p><p>ever nearer came that slow beat of sound, </p><p>touching nerve centers as insistently as </p><p>the insect humming irritated the ear- </p><p>drums. </p><p> Then the jungle was ended and Wil-</p><p>loughby saw a bamboo palisade enclosing </p><p>ground that had once been cleared and </p><p>under cultivation; yet the jungle, beaten </p><p>back, had swarmed again, choking the </p><p>garden, creeping over the palisade and </p><p>the crushed coral walk which led to a </p><p>substantial dwelling with nipa-thatched </p><p>roof and a vine-covered pergola leading </p><p>to shore rocks which rose abruptly at one </p><p>side. It was then that Willoughby under- </p><p>stood that diapason of sound, the shock </p><p>of outer seas breaking in subterranean </p><p>caverns. </p><p>The Chinese who had guided him did </p><p>not enter the gate, but darted beside </p><p>the palisade. Willoughby heard no sign </p><p>of human presence save the "shir-rr” of </p><p>his boot-soles on the coral. Then a Chi- </p><p>nese wearing the white ducks of a house- </p><p>boy appeared in a doorway cut through </p><p>luxuriant bougainvillea vines purple with </p><p>bloom. He stood staring at Willoughby, </p><p>with his hands twisting together. For a </p><p>moment Willoughby felt again that sense </p><p>of helplessness bred by the jungle, the </p><p>fear of encroaching death. </p><p> "Tell your boss-man that Willoughby</p><p>is here," he said. </p><p> He followed the Chinese into the</p><p>house. The large living-room was shaded </p><p>and cool. Chinese matting covered the </p><p>floor. Sea-grass chairs offered ease. There </p><p>were wall cases filled with labeled speci- </p><p>mens of sea denizens, a table holding a </p><p>typewriter and note-book and some loose </p><p>pages of script. The house was clean and </p><p>orderly, yet he still felt as if the jungle </p><p>lay too close for safety. </p><p> W. T.—8</p><p> "Boss-man, he come bimeby,” ven-</p><p>tured the Chinese plaintively. </p><p> "Where’s Chueng Ching?” Willough-</p><p>by knew the Chinese student had accom- </p><p>panied Denham to his retreat and, it was </p><p>rumored, provided funds for the scien- </p><p>tist. </p><p> "Him gone long time. I not know</p><p>much.” The reply brought a grimace </p><p>from the house-boy, as of apprehension. </p><p> "You got one piecee ship, I go out</p><p>’longside,” he added plaintively, then </p><p>darted back at the sound of steps, as </p><p>Professor Denham entered. </p><p> Willoughby was shocked at the change</p><p>in him. Denham’s skin seemed stretched </p><p>over his bones, his eyes shone like those </p><p>of a madman, the hand extended to Wil- </p><p>loughby felt cold and lifeless as that of a </p><p>corpse in spite of tropic heat. </p><p> "Glad you arrived, Willoughby,” he</p><p>said. "You’ve come too late to see Chu- </p><p>eng Ching today, but he’ll be here to- </p><p>morrow. We’ll eat, then you can rest. </p><p>You’ll excuse me if I write a few notes </p><p>right away. I’ve just come from Chueng </p><p>Ching and I must get them down at </p><p>once.” </p><p> Willoughby was a little surprized, but</p><p>he followed the house-boy to a room with </p><p>a bed screened by netting, took off his </p><p>shoes, collar and coat and dropped on the </p><p>cotton covering and dozed. He was awak- </p><p>ened by the clink of dishes. In the living- </p><p>room a table was set for two, but Den- </p><p>ham did not appear. </p><p> The house-boy hovered near, serving</p><p>Willoughby eagerly, and when the coffee </p><p>was brought voiced again his wistful plea, </p><p>"You got one piecee ship, I go out ’long- </p><p>side.” </p><p> He seemed to hang on Willoughby’s</p><p>answer. Plainly the Chinese was in the </p><p>grip of fear, and the white man remem- </p><p>bered again the encroaching jungle and </p><p>the derelict rooted to sea gardens. He </p><p>wished Denham would return, and went </p><p>,754 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>on the porch to look for his host. He did </p><p>not mind the lack of courtesy, but the si- </p><p>lence and oppression were affecting his </p><p>nerves. Tropic night had fallen, the mos- </p><p>quitoes were vicious. Beyond the mur- </p><p>mur of sea caverns he heard nothing, and </p><p>returned to the house, to look at the speci- </p><p>mens in wall cases, then to reach the </p><p>typewriter stand where he glanced at a </p><p>sheet still in the carrier. Without con- </p><p>sciousness of reading something not in- </p><p>tended for him, Willoughby glanced at </p><p>the typing in view: </p><p> "There is now no doubt but that phys-</p><p>ical coarseness of the beast has absorbed </p><p>the fine mentality of Chueng Ching. I </p><p>fed him double the usual amount of </p><p>chicken yesterday, and he was in a fine </p><p>rage for more. His roarings are bestial. </p><p>The pool was lashed to foam by his fury. </p><p>And I am assured that his rage was di- </p><p>rected toward me, his friend and com- </p><p>panion. It is scarcely a year since he was </p><p>sorrowful at the thought that I should </p><p>die before he died and leave him alone. </p><p>Now he is all brute and I am punished. </p><p>He no longer heeds my voice ...” </p><p> As if the writer had been interrupted</p><p>at his task, the sentence was left unfin- </p><p>ished. Willoughby read with mingled </p><p>rage and horror. Evidently Chueng Ching </p><p>had gone insane and he had been hired </p><p>to care for a madman. He resented it. </p><p>Yet he was virtually a prisoner on the </p><p>island unless he could find the boatman </p><p>who brought him. He stood a moment, </p><p>wondering what to do. The little house- </p><p>boy lingered near him constantly without </p><p>giving the impression of watching, but </p><p>shook his head when Willoughby de- </p><p>manded to see Denham. </p><p> "No can do," he said plaintively.</p><p> Willoughby went through the cur-</p><p>tained doorway into a room evidently be- </p><p>longing to Chueng Ching, to judge by the </p><p>embroidered tapestries moving in the </p><p>draft. Chests of carved teak stood be- </p><p>tween wall cases. A table held metal </p><p>tubes, with sealed ends and addressed to </p><p>the Royal College at Pekin. Willoughby</p><p>heard the squawking of hens and ran out- </p><p>side into the pergola of vines. A lantern </p><p>stood beside a bamboo coop and Profes- </p><p>sor Denham was wringing the neck of a </p><p>hen and tossing it on the ground while he </p><p>reached for others. He looked at Wil- </p><p>loughby, and it seemed to him that Den- </p><p>ham’s eyes held mingled fear and mad- </p><p>ness. </p><p> Then he heard the sound of water</p><p>threshed as if by storm, although there </p><p>was no wind and not a leaf of the vines </p><p>stirred. </p><p> "Chueng Ching,” said Denham. "Hun-</p><p>gry again. Such gluttony! I wish you’d </p><p>arrived earlier, but it’s difficult to see him </p><p>at night. Go into the house, Willoughby, </p><p>and read those notes you’ll find. I’ll re- </p><p>turn presently and tell you all about </p><p>him.” </p><p> Denham gathered the slaughtered hens</p><p>and darted down the vine-covered pas- </p><p>sageway of the pergola. There was the </p><p>sound of an iron door banged shut, the </p><p>repeated noise of water threshed violent- </p><p>ly, and Willoughby returned to the house, </p><p>where he took up the typed script, ar- </p><p>ranged the pages according to numbers </p><p>and glanced over them. Fear, horror, fas- </p><p>cination held him. He forgot where he </p><p>was. He was unaware of the house-boy </p><p>standing mute near his chair, seeking </p><p>companionship in a fear that was sapping </p><p>his life. Willoughby sat on the edge of </p><p>his chair, hair slowly rising, scalp prickly, </p><p>his palms moist with cold sweat. </p><p>SCT have now the evidence that ocean </p><p>-fi- depths are a desert of ice-cold water </p><p>with no living organism; soundless, still, </p><p>dark nothingness. A ship sinking to </p><p>those depths would cease to be, ground </p><p>into molecules on the ocean bed. The si- </p><p>lence must be fearful. But greatest satis- </p><p>LAOCOON </p><p>755 </p><p>faction of all is the proving of my theory </p><p>that sea-serpents, as they are popularly </p><p>called, do exist, and that their armor of </p><p>scales and longevity has preserved some </p><p>of them to this day. The cavern pool is </p><p>an ideal spot for such a sea denizen to </p><p>lurk. Chueng Ching told me that he had </p><p>heard rumors of this haunted cavern, </p><p>when we were both in California, and he </p><p>is as delighted as I, that we have found </p><p>the thing, and my years of research are </p><p>rewarded. . . . </p><p> "It is three months since I added to</p><p>this diary. Chueng Ching is despondent. </p><p>The w'hite spot which he tells me has </p><p>been spreading for a year is only too </p><p>plainly evidence of leprosy. Chueng </p><p>Ching is accursed, doomed to a lingering </p><p>death, a tragedy for both of us. He feels </p><p>it keenly because we have found what we </p><p>sought, and for him there will not be </p><p>time to pursue the study of die sea-ser- </p><p>pent. We spoke, last night, of the re- </p><p>strictions of man’s limited span of life, </p><p>the pity that we are not given enough </p><p>years, even centuries, for research. One </p><p>envies the sea-serpent, which is undoubt- </p><p>edly older than whales, older than the se- </p><p>quoias of California, much older than the </p><p>Christian era. To judge by his length and </p><p>the size of his armor plates, our dragon </p><p>is centuries old. I said to Chueng Ching </p><p>that I wished I could inhabit his body, </p><p>and not only live indefinitely but also ex- </p><p>plore the ocean depths, learn his man- </p><p>ners of living and perhaps find his rela- </p><p>tives. Chueng Ching seemed startled ra- </p><p>ther than amused. . . . </p><p> "Two months later. This morning</p><p>Chueng Ching asked a terrific thing of </p><p>me. He pleaded the growing decay of </p><p>his flesh. His fingers are already numb. </p><p>He believes that I could give him the </p><p>magnificent body and strength of our </p><p>sea-serpent, a thought suggested no doubt </p><p>by those experimental tamperings of mine </p><p>in college surgery,, substituting the brains </p><p>of one rodent for those of another. But </p><p>I could not do such a thing. Chueng </p><p>Ching is a man, a brother to me, a fine </p><p>mentality, a higher organism.” </p><p> Willoughby ripped open his shirt,</p><p>longing for a cooling breath on his skin. </p><p>The shadow of the house-boy fell across </p><p>his feet; the brown hands were twisting </p><p>mutely. The page he had just read fell </p><p>to the floor, and he seized the next. </p><p> "Chueng Ching has worked out an ar-</p><p>rangement by which he is confident we </p><p>can manage the operation. The steel net </p><p>will confine the sea-serpent, a collar of </p><p>steel will hold his head while I shoot </p><p>ether from a spray-gun. The bench, the </p><p>instruments, the cauterants, are ready. </p><p>Only, I am afraid. If it were not that </p><p>Chueng Ching's fingers and toes are al- </p><p>ready sloughing away, I could not do this </p><p>thing. He pleads all day, and moans all </p><p>night. Tomorrow I shall be alone save </p><p>for the house-boy Wi Wo and the boat- </p><p>man who is hired to call here at regular </p><p>intervals.” </p><p> There was the rustling of the page</p><p>which Willoughby crushed in tense fin- </p><p>gers as he took it up, and the sound of </p><p>his heavy breathing. </p><p> "Chueng Chin wakened with a great</p><p>fear, although he assures me that he went </p><p>under the anesthetic not only reconciled </p><p>but even rejoicing in a resurrection of </p><p>which he felt surer than I did. He felt </p><p>no pain, only fear and the sense of a great </p><p>weight dragging him down. No doubt </p><p>the serpent body is not yet under control </p><p>of nerve telegraphy of the mind. I at- </p><p>tribute his fear to the same cause. Time </p><p>will cure both troubles. Today, I made </p><p>out the first of his attempts to communi- </p><p>cate with me. There is no doubt he </p><p>speaks, but I scarce understand his words, </p><p>roared in that tremendous voice. I spent </p><p>hours with him, and had Wi Wo fetch </p><p>my meals. I asked questions to which he </p><p>Could reply by a nod or shake of his great </p><p>75 6 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>crested head. What a pity those fools </p><p>who ridiculed my assertions that sea- </p><p>dragons do exist, cannot see this triumph! </p><p> "The vitality of Chueng Ching’s body</p><p>is prodigious. He revived quickly from the </p><p>ether. The leprous shell of my poor </p><p>friend is in the ocean depths, sewn in </p><p>canvas, weighted with iron. The sea will </p><p>sing a requiem. But Chueng Ching is </p><p>now invulnerable and magnificent. Noth- </p><p>ing could harm that marvelously con- </p><p>structed coat of mail unless it is some </p><p>device of man, the destroyer.” </p><p> Willoughby lifted his head and</p><p>brushed his hand across his eyes. He was </p><p>entering into horror that chilled his flesh, </p><p>a nightmare he could not and would not </p><p>believe. He abominated the crime of </p><p>Denham, yet was fascinated. </p><p> "He will not take meat, yet we fed the</p><p>sea-serpent he now inhabits, at regular </p><p>intervals, on raw flesh. But since the </p><p>change Chueng Ching will not touch it. </p><p>No doubt the higher mentality of an </p><p>esthete has subjugated the beast body. </p><p>Today I prepared another roll of notes </p><p>for the Royal College of Pekin, a rare </p><p>collection of data which will receive con- </p><p>sideration from Chinese savants that I </p><p>could not wrest from my own people. </p><p>Chueng Ching and I have proved the ex- </p><p>istence of sea-dragons and the ability of </p><p>science through martyrdom to penetrate </p><p>to the mysteries beneath the waters.” </p><p>Willoughby mopped his face. Wi </p><p>Wo held a tray toward him and he </p><p>took a bottle it held and poured himself </p><p>a peg of brandy, then seized the next </p><p>page. </p><p> "Chueng Ching is timid of the dark.</p><p>His fear throttles our investigations. And </p><p>much that he would impart is lost </p><p>through my faulty understanding of his </p><p>articulation. The curse of Babel rings </p><p>down the ages. He breaks into Cantonese </p><p>in his endeavor to enlighten me. The </p><p>finer details would be invaluable, but I </p><p>hoped too greatly. I cannot understand </p><p>his fear, and his rather pathetic regret at</p><p>the loneliness he will find when I am </p><p>dead. But one thing comforts me: he is </p><p>taking food, and prefers rather under- </p><p>cooked chicken and pork. I must keep a </p><p>stock on hand, as his appetite is pro- </p><p>digious. . . . </p><p> "Six months since I last wrote those</p><p>notes. Chueng Ching has furnished me </p><p>with priceless specimens and data of the </p><p>ocean depths, the notes of which I seal </p><p>daily in metal tubes to be sent to Pekin. </p><p>But I notice a change in him. While at </p><p>first he was afraid of the depths, he now </p><p>goes fearlessly and remains for a longer </p><p>period each time. The silence down there </p><p>must be fearful, but he seems to like ex- </p><p>ploring, and has even identified geo- </p><p>graphic indentations of continent shores, </p><p>and recognizes the chill of polar seas. . . . </p><p> "Three months from my last entry.</p><p>Another period of change has come over </p><p>Chueng Ching. The little fish spewed </p><p>from his jaws are spoiled by carelessness. </p><p>Things are not going so well. There is a </p><p>change of temperament and his articula- </p><p>tion is thick. For a time he spoke clearly, </p><p>although in a voice like a church organ. </p><p>Now he roars in sullen rage when I re- </p><p>fuse to feed him before I obtain an ac- </p><p>count of his wanderings. I believe it was </p><p>a mistake to feed him flesh. Better to </p><p>have left him to find sea-food only. I </p><p>wonder if the brute body is in ascendance, </p><p>or if meeting other monsters of his own </p><p>kind has upset him. He would know no </p><p>means of communication with them, and </p><p>no methods of defense, but what a spec- </p><p>tacle it would be to view a battle of sea- </p><p>dragons! I wish it had been my lot to </p><p>change from a human to this saurian. I </p><p>am past middle age and the passions </p><p>which plague a youuger man. Chueng </p><p>Ching, who in his human shape was </p><p>LAOCOON </p><p>757. </p><p>vowed to celibacy and had devoted his </p><p>life to science, is seeking a mate. He was </p><p>never more lucid than when he roared to </p><p>me that he had found a 'sweetie’, the col- </p><p>lege slang of old days for a sweetheart, </p><p>and demanded more food for strength he </p><p>would need to fight off other males of </p><p>his kind. With great sorrow, I must ad- </p><p>mit the end is in sight. He is indifferent </p><p>to our researches and I gained nothing </p><p>today but the account of this female sea- </p><p>dragon, which seems coy and exhibits </p><p>greater speed and endurance than Chueng </p><p>Ching, as they tear through the depths, </p><p>circling islands, lashing a riot of phos- </p><p>phorescence in the night. Oh, to see </p><p>them! To find another and change from </p><p>this body hampering me to a saurian like </p><p>Chueng Ching!” </p><p> Cold sweat broke out on Willoughby’s</p><p>forehead as he took the last sheet from </p><p>the typewriter, and re-read the bit which </p><p>had fascinated him a little while before. </p><p> He understood perfectly what Denham</p><p>had written, of the change over this </p><p>thing. The brute body had conquered the </p><p>mind of Chueng Ching. The ferocity of </p><p>the sea-dragon was in ascendance. He </p><p>had turned on Denham, no longer obey- </p><p>ing the voice of the scientist. The re- </p><p>mainder of the page held no less of hor- </p><p>ror, a prophetic intimation of Denham’s </p><p>fear. </p><p> "Chueng Ching is a fiend. He struck</p><p>at me today with open jaws. I have </p><p>sealed the complete notes to date, and </p><p>addressed the results of my researches to </p><p>the Royal College at Pekin, where they </p><p>will act on the instructions to use the bal- </p><p>ance of Chueng Ching’s wealth to pursue </p><p>this investigation in case anything should </p><p>happen to me. But Willoughby has ar- </p><p>rived, and I am confident that the skill </p><p>he displayed in the science class can be </p><p>enhanced by practise so that he can per- </p><p>form the operation I desire. Chueng </p><p>Ching laughed when I told him my plan, </p><p>but promised to entice another male of </p><p>his kind to the pool where Willoughby </p><p>and I shall trap him by means of the </p><p>iron-barred gateways dropped behind this</p><p>sea-dragon we used as a body for the </p><p>brain of Chueng Ching. I have not talked </p><p>to Willoughby about it, but I noticed he </p><p>seemed as well set up and fit as in college </p><p>days. His reward shall be a share of </p><p>Giueng Ching’s wealth, and the fame </p><p>of-” </p><p> Willoughby crushed the sheet in his</p><p>hand, every nerve in his body on edge, </p><p>his breathing sounding loud in the silence. </p><p>The chair crashed over as he rose and </p><p>stared past Wi Wo at the curtained door- </p><p>way. The embroidered dragons seemed </p><p>to move with malignant life. And a more </p><p>terrible dragon inhabited this place, the </p><p>madness which had caught Denham and </p><p>made of him a priest of more dreadful </p><p>rites than voodoo of the jungles. </p><p> Willoughby realized now for what he</p><p>had been summoned by the scientist. He </p><p>must escape or be caught in a trap from </p><p>which there was no escape. He would </p><p>find Denham, and tell him that he was </p><p>going; Denham was at that moment near </p><p>the pool. Willoughby remembered the </p><p>chickens he had been killing, and his </p><p>words: "Chueng Ching, hungry again. </p><p>Such gluttony!” He remembered the </p><p>sound as of water threshed by storm. </p><p>Denham feared the thing, yet he had </p><p>gone to it again. He might be in danger </p><p>of his life. Common decency demanded </p><p>that Willoughby try to save the man. As </p><p>for remaining under the conditions to be </p><p>imposed, his body shivered as if with </p><p>nausea at the thought. </p><p> Under the vine-covered pergola, he</p><p>was startled by the sight of Wi Wo in </p><p>his white ducks. The hand of the Chi- </p><p>nese fell on his arm, the man’s teeth </p><p>chattered like castanets. And above the </p><p>758 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>chattering and Willoughby’s breathing, </p><p>came the sound of water crashing on </p><p>rocks, threshed under flails of no wind </p><p>that ever was. </p><p>Willoughby stalked down the per- </p><p>gola, gripping his courage in his </p><p>hand, assuring himself the typing was the </p><p>fantasy of a madman, and that the worst </p><p>he would find would be Denham in the </p><p>violence of insanity brought on by lone- </p><p>liness and the eery mystery of the island. </p><p>The heelless slippers of Wi Wo shuffled </p><p>reluctantly as they came near an iron </p><p>door, with light from beyond shining </p><p>through the space between heavy bars. </p><p>Willoughby saw the lantern on the stone </p><p>floor. Steps led down. There was the </p><p>crash of waves subsiding gradually, and </p><p>a low moaning audible. </p><p> Willoughby opened the iron door,</p><p>snatched up the lantern and began to </p><p>descend the steps. A cool wind swept </p><p>upward, a smell of sea-wrack and cavern </p><p>chill. He saw the oily luminance of </p><p>water where the sea filled a natural cove. </p><p>It was stirred as by violent upheaval from </p><p>beneath. The rock ledge below glistened </p><p>with minute sea life. He saw something </p><p>resembling a huge horse-collar slung to </p><p>iron rings in the cavern roof, and a steel </p><p>net dependent from ropes, the apparatus </p><p>of that operation performed on the sea- </p><p>dragon. Along one side was a litter of </p><p>things scarcely discernible by the faint </p><p>lanternlight. </p><p> With his scalp prickling, Willoughby</p><p>held the lantern at arm’s length, to learn </p><p>what manner of gigantic bird it was that* </p><p>ran to and fro on the ledge, uttering </p><p>squawks of fear which the cavern echoed. </p><p>He saw a heap of dead chickens on the </p><p>ledge; then a movement of Wi Wo </p><p>caught his eye. The Chinese was retreat- </p><p>ing up the steps, backward, his eyes star- </p><p>ing at the pool, his hands groping along </p><p>the rock wall. Willoughby looked again </p><p>at the pool, straining his vision to see </p><p>what had thralled Wi Wo and turned his </p><p>yellow skin green with terror. </p><p> It came like gushing light in the</p><p>depths, stirring the black water, a radi- </p><p>ance of glittering unrest, undulating flit- </p><p>ter and shadow, faintly phosphorescent; </p><p>then coils broke a moving swirl in the </p><p>gloom. </p><p> Willoughby turned to run up the steps.</p><p>The breath of Wi Wo hissed between his </p><p>teeth. There was the silken slur of water </p><p>washing the rode, and in another moment </p><p>Willoughby was crowding the Chinese on </p><p>the steps, for the water parted and a crest- </p><p>ed head wras upreared, water dripping </p><p>from fanged jaws, red tongue quivering, </p><p>large glassy eyes regarding the two men on </p><p>the steps with malevolent glaring. Coils of </p><p>a serpent body upreared. Willoughby saw </p><p>the great scales like iridescent metal </p><p>plates. There was that threshing hiss of </p><p>water, tremendous in the cavern walls. </p><p>Willoughby’s heart was pounding in his </p><p>throat and wrist. Fear paralyzed him. </p><p> Then he screamed. From that great</p><p>throat came a roar that swelled and </p><p>boomed, and in that sound Willoughby </p><p>heard unmistakably the name of "Den- </p><p>ham” howled in wrath. </p><p> His own scream seemed to be echoed</p><p>by the flapping white thing on the ledge. </p><p>For the first time he realized that he had </p><p>lost the chance for what he came to do: </p><p>to save Denham. That was Denham— </p><p>that mad disheveled thing clad in white </p><p>ducks which was bent nearly double, </p><p>weaving its coat-tail over its head. It stood </p><p>erect, laughing horribly. </p><p> "Chueng Ching,” it called, "did you</p><p>bring your sea-dragon? See, Willoughby </p><p>is here, Willoughby w’ho will make me </p><p>invulnerable so we can rove the deeps </p><p>together. ...” </p><p> The rest was drowned in that howl of</p><p>the sea-dragon, a burst of laughter </p><p>boomed through a gigantic throat, and </p><p>the crested head swooped at Denham. </p><p>The sea leaped, a wave shot by those </p><p>armored coils crashed up the steps and </p><p>over Willoughby. The lantern fell from </p><p>his numbed fingers, the sea was in his </p><p>mouth. </p><p> Then he felt the hands of Wi Wo</p><p>clutching him. They were crouched in a </p><p>heap on the steps. The pool was dark </p><p>and the seas fell quiet. Willoughby felt </p><p>his way a few steps lower and saw the </p><p>outer archway of the cove. Dawn had </p><p>bloomed, early tropic dawn shone silver. </p><p>The ledge was empty. Denham had dis- </p><p>appeared. </p><p> Willoughby turned and pushing the</p><p>terrified Chinese before him went up the </p><p>steps, clanging and bolting the iron door. </p><p> He strode through the house, looked</p><p>at the sealed tube of notes addressed </p><p>ready to send, and at the typed account </p><p>of Denham’s crime. Then he went to </p><p>the porch. </p><p> A voice at his shoulder startled him:</p><p>"You got one piecee ship, I go out ’long </p><p>you.” The plaintive wail was chattered </p><p>through quivering lips. </p><p> "Come on,” snapped Willoughby and</p><p>ran down the path. </p><p> Along the palisade sauntered the Chi-</p><p>nese boatman. Willoughby took money </p><p>from his pocket and offered it. </p><p> "Take us back to port,” he com-</p><p>manded. "Quick!” </p><p>Polaris </p><p> (Continued from page 751)</p><p>shake off this unnatural dream of a house </p><p>of stone and brick south of a sinister </p><p>swamp and a cemetery on a low hillock; </p><p>the Pole Star, evil and monstrous, leers </p><p>down from the black vault, winking hid- </p><p>eously like an insane watching eye which </p><p>strives to convey some message, yet recalls </p><p>nothing save that it once had a message </p><p>to convey. </p><p>FOR THE COMPLETE </p><p>5 VOLUME SET </p><p>|OW you can travel round tho world with tlio most daring ad- </p><p>venturers.

The first of these is based on </p><p>a passage from George Sterling’s A Wine of </p><p>Wizardry—a passage so striking that Am- </p><p>brose Bierce gave it rank alongside those </p><p>famous passages from Coleridge’s Kubla </p><p>Khan and Keats’s Ode to a Nightingale </p><p>which Dante Gabriel Rossetti called the two </p><p>Pillars of Hercules of modern human imagi- </p><p>nation. One of these Finlay illustrations will </p><p>appear in each issue. He will draw his sub- </p><p>jects from the whole realm of weird litera- </p><p>ture. Poe’s mclancholy Raven will appear </p><p>here, and the angel Israfcl, "whose heart- </p><p>strings are a lute;” the Weird Sisters from </p><p>Shakespeare’s Macbeth; the Belle Dame Sans </p><p>Merci of Keats; Longfellow’s grisly Skele- </p><p>ton in Armor; Burns’s Tam o’ Shanter pur- </p><p>sued by the warlocks; and many other gems </p><p>of weird literature. Let us know what you </p><p>think of this feature. </p><p>Ilere It Is </p><p> Gertrude Hemken, of Chicago, writes:</p><p>"Once again I present myself in epistle- </p><p>form. This time with thanks to David H. </p><p>Keller for his Tiger Cat—the leddy in the </p><p>tale had a fine way of getting revenge for </p><p>that sad instance in New York—I appreciate </p><p>Doctor Keller’s finesse in letting the read- </p><p>ers know how a woman can feel about being </p><p>mistreated. One would almost believe a </p><p>woman had written the story. I am all in </p><p>sympathy with the Tiger Cat, although her </p><p>demise did not sadden me. . . . Icky—one </p><p>of those slimy tales—and by HPL—wooeey! </p><p>The Shunned House was something far be- </p><p>yond my imagination. The more I read of </p><p>760 </p><p>Lovecraft’s works, the more I see in them </p><p>the modern Poe—by his minute detail of </p><p>every angle—the history of the family which </p><p>built the house—the exact description of the </p><p>plot of ground in which this ancient dwell- </p><p>ing stood (a person could almost draw a </p><p>map of the site)—on such things I find HPL </p><p>so very like Poe. I caught myself gasping </p><p>a bit when reading of the containers of </p><p>sulfur being emptied on that blasphemous </p><p>slime and of the resulting fumes. Dear me, </p><p>how awful it would be if such really hap- </p><p>pened! (And then the question comes to </p><p>my mind that perhaps it did occur.) Al-</p><p>though The Homicidal Diary was not the </p><p>type of tale I now associate Earl Peirce, Jr., </p><p>with, I did find it fascinating—very. What </p><p>strange things dreams can do to one—and </p><p>what strange dreams a person can have— </p><p>and what strange things hypnosis can make </p><p>one do. Gruesome? Yes—retchingly so. </p><p>But why can’t we have another on the order </p><p>of The Last Archer? What about it, EP? </p><p>Well, now, lemme see—dunno just what to </p><p>say about The Long Arm—the whole thing </p><p>just sorta disappointed me—wasn’t quite </p><p>nasty enough for my gluttonous taste. Gosh, </p><p>I’m getting to be a real fiend. Thrills and </p><p>adventure galore—do I like this Lake of </p><p>Life! Am looking forward to the next in- </p><p>stallment and then for more yarns like it. </p><p>Darkest Africa holds so many strange se- </p><p>crets—I find it more fascinating than the </p><p>Orient. Mr. Hamilton has me on my toes </p><p>wondering what the Guardians are and what </p><p>force they have released on the ring of </p><p>mountains to discharge instant death to tres- </p><p>passers. Wellman writes the most curious </p><p>tales of the oddest things coming to life— </p><p>well, sort of a tangible existence. Last time </p><p>it was a parchment—now it’s fat and bulging </p><p>cherubs that just ain’t cherubs. Nasty things, </p><p>weren’t they? Here Lies was a laugh-getter </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>761 </p><p>—but!—what was so weird about it? Is my </p><p>mind getting dull ? The outstanding story in </p><p>this month’s issue—to me—was your reprint </p><p>of Rich’s The Purple Cincture. I could see </p><p>those terrible glowing colors—angry colors— </p><p>I could see them so plainly and could see </p><p>the suffering of those afflicted—my nerves </p><p>twitched as though that searing pain were </p><p>severing my foot and hand—I didn’t dare </p><p>think of my neck. Now for the Eyrie—I can </p><p>add no more to your answer to G. M. Wil- </p><p>son on his astonishing accusation—the very </p><p>idea of him—how dare he do such to WT! </p><p>—my gawsh—he doesn’t read the magazine </p><p>thoroughly enough. Good gosh—if a per- </p><p>son is going to read WT with a grain of </p><p>salt, how the deuce can he get any pleasure </p><p>out of it? The idea is to leave one’s mind </p><p>open to all possibilities and forget how it’s </p><p>gonna end—the day is past and gone when </p><p>the fair-haired boy rescued the beauteous </p><p>maiden from a fate worse than death just in </p><p>the nick of time. Some stories must end that </p><p>way, but the people these days demand va- </p><p>riety—and variety is what they get. One </p><p>time the hero or she-hero dies or is overcome </p><p>—next time they escape, but not unscathed— </p><p>and mebbe the third time they run true to the </p><p>old-fashioned style. If GMW has any old </p><p>copies of WT and should he glance through </p><p>them, he will find that he has been very un- </p><p>just. I can say no more. Reginald A. Pryke </p><p>of Kent, England, writes so grandly of How- </p><p>ard what I have never been able to express. </p><p>Should I never keep a copy of WT—I’d </p><p>keep this one for the fine tribute he has </p><p>paid Howard and his incomparable creations </p><p>of mankind. Let me take this opportunity to </p><p>thank Mr. Pryke for a fine letter—I’ve read </p><p>few as good in the Eyrie. Once again I </p><p>ask—who is WC, Jr.? Sort of a WT Walter </p><p>Winchell?—eh wot? I liked the random </p><p>biography WC, Jr., gives of Clifford Ball— </p><p>it’s such things as these that we readers want </p><p>to know of the authors—just bits of human </p><p>news which we know will make them seem </p><p>more real to us. Will we have more of such </p><p>inside stuff—please?’' </p><p>From a Spanish Friend </p><p> Jorge Thuillier writes from Havana,</p><p>Cuba: "I have been a reader of Weird </p><p>Tales for several years. I read it every </p><p>month in Spain, my native country, and now</p><p>that the great Spanish tragedy has driven me </p><p>out of my home and to this island, I have </p><p>Man Can Now </p><p>Talk With God </p><p> SAYS NOTED PSYCHOLOGIST</p><p> "A new and revolutionary religious teaching</p><p>based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the </p><p>Galilean Carpenter, and designed to show how we </p><p>may find, understand and use the same identical </p><p>power which Jesus used in performing His so- </p><p>called Miracles,” is attracting world wide attention </p><p>to its founder, Dr. Frank B. Robinson, noted </p><p>psychologist, author and lecturer. </p><p> "Psychiana,” this new psychological religion,</p><p>believes and teaches that it is today possible for </p><p>every normal human being, understanding spiritual </p><p>law as Christ understood it, "to duplicate every </p><p>work that the Carpenter of Galilee ever did”—it </p><p>believes and teaches that when He said, “the </p><p>things that I do shall ye do also,” He meant what </p><p>He said and meant it literally to all mankind, </p><p>through all the ages. </p><p> Dr. Robinson has prepared a 6000 word treatise</p><p>on "Psychiana,” in which he tells about his long </p><p>search for the Truth, how he finally came to the </p><p>full realization of an Unseen Power or force "so </p><p>dynamic in itself that all other powers and forces </p><p>fade into insignificance beside it”—how he learned </p><p>to commune directly with the Living God, using </p><p>this mighty, never-failing power to demonstrate </p><p>health, happiness and financial success, and how </p><p>any normal being may find and use it as Jesus did. </p><p>He is now offering this treatise free to every </p><p>reader of this magazine who writes him. </p><p> If you want to read this "highly interesting,</p><p>revolutionary and fascinating story of the discov- </p><p>ery of a great Truth,” just send your name and </p><p>address to Dr. Frank B.

Generally speaking, the </p><p>whole magazine is a priceless gift for all </p><p>lovers of the unusual and weird. I hope I </p><p>shall be able to read it for many years to </p><p>come.” </p><p>Orchids to Mr. Pryke </p><p> Pete Thompson, of Seattle, writes: "My</p><p>first fan letter. I have been reading Weird </p><p>Tales for about three years off and on and </p><p>really think you have finally reached the </p><p>acme of perfection. Tiger Cat by D. H. </p><p>Keller was tops in the October issue, as was </p><p>The Homicidal Diary. . . . Orchids to you, </p><p>my dear Reginald A. Pryke of Kent, Eng- </p><p>land—your harangue on reasons for not re- </p><p>viving Conan, or any of the other brain </p><p>children of our past master WT authors, </p><p>hits the spot. Really I’ve wanted to say the </p><p>same things. Thanks for putting into words </p><p>what I’ve wanted to but lacked the ability.” </p><p>Poe Outshone </p><p> George W. Skora, of Tucson, Arizona,</p><p>writes: "A devoted reader of weird and </p><p>science fiction, I have been reading Weird </p><p>Tales for the last eight years. Although I </p><p>am a singularly imaginative person, I do not </p><p>read our magazine for the revolting, shud- </p><p>dery, terrifying aspcct of its stories, but for </p><p>the occasional tales, becoming more numer- </p><p>ous of late, which translate me, mind and </p><p>body, to some other age, or to some other </p><p>world, where I can indulge my fancy in </p><p>sword’s-play, in adventure, in the mystery, </p><p>romance, and superstition of another time or</p><p>another dimension. Perhaps such reading </p><p>forms an escape for me from reality and </p><p>allows me, in my mind at least, to indulge </p><p>and participate in the action of other periods. </p><p>I am most grateful to Weird Tales for do- </p><p>ing this for me. And diese modern masters </p><p>of weird fiction so far outshine Poe and his </p><p>contemporaries that there is absolutely no </p><p>comparison. It is as though a twenty-watt </p><p>bulb were expcctcd to shine the dazzling </p><p>light of a carbon arc. Such tales as Sham- </p><p>blean, The Three Marked Pennies, The </p><p>Black God’s Kiss, all the barbaric adventures </p><p>of Conan the Cimmerian, of Jirel of Joiry, </p><p>of King Kull, and such odiers as the fasci- </p><p>nating Globe of Memories, The Last Pha- </p><p>raoh, which was one of the greatest stories </p><p>I have ever read, Red Nails, the masterful </p><p>Clicking Red Heels, The Carnal God, The </p><p>Hounds of Tindalos, all of the Northwest </p><p>Smith stories, and in the present issue, the </p><p>best of the Jules de Grandin stories,' I be- </p><p>lieve, Pledged to the Death, which impressed </p><p>me very favorably, all of these and numerous </p><p>others will live for ever in my imagination, </p><p>and I often go back and read them over to </p><p>recapture their mood. Weird fiction has lost </p><p>perhaps its two greatest masters, Howard </p><p>Phillips Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, </p><p>and with them the heroes which they created </p><p>have died. No more will Conan the bar- </p><p>barian fight from one end to the other of </p><p>those mysterious half-legendary lands, no </p><p>more will he woo and win fair maidens in </p><p>his inimitable fashion, no more will he defy </p><p>warrior and king alike, for the master pen </p><p>which created him is no more and with that </p><p>passing Conan is likewise gone for ever. I </p><p>cannot conceive of his being recreated by </p><p>anyone with the mastery of Robert E. How- </p><p>ard, and hence would radier see Conan dead </p><p>as he had lived, a fighting-man who per- </p><p>ished as he would have wished, sword in </p><p>hand, the grim smile of desperate battle on </p><p>his lips, in his ears the din of clashing blade </p><p>and shouting men who felt its cunning edge. </p><p>That world of his is gone. It would be </p><p>blasphemy to attempt the rebuilding from </p><p>dead ashes. And in closing, let me mention </p><p>one more story whidi I will long remember: </p><p>The Fire of Asshurbanipal, a thrilling story </p><p>if ever there was one. On rereading this let- </p><p>ter, I once more feel the futility of mere </p><p>words to say the things or express the </p><p>thoughts that I really feel. You have one of </p><p>the finest magazines, one of the finest staffs </p><p>of artists and authors, of any publishing</p><p>company in this country. And I do not say </p><p>this with intention of flattery. I really mean </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>763 </p><p>it and with sincerity. I would buy Weird </p><p>Tales if it were a dollar a copy, much as it </p><p>would strain my pocketbook. I have no </p><p>faults to find other than the desire that </p><p>Brundage would give us an occasional bru- </p><p>nette on the cover of the mag, and I would </p><p>personally like to see one cover in black and </p><p>white merely for the striking effect it would </p><p>give.” </p><p>Like Rare Old Wine </p><p> Natalie Rockwell, of Syracuse, New York,</p><p>writes: "How does an ungrateful little </p><p>wench like myself express her gratitude for </p><p>the really great pleasure you’ve given her in </p><p>your incomparable magazine, WT? I've </p><p>been reading your mag. for years (tho’ I’m </p><p>only 18), but I’ve never screwed up enough </p><p>courage to tell you about it. Just finished </p><p>your October issue to the accompaniment of </p><p>a luscious thunderstorm. I always try to keep </p><p>from reading it 'till I have the proper atmos- </p><p>phere. (It’s a darned hard job tho’ not to </p><p>take a little peek at the intriguing book </p><p>waiting my pleasure on the table.) The Lake </p><p>of Life and Pledged to the Dead are tops </p><p>in that issue. I’ve always liked Jules any- </p><p>way. He seems to be so human and lovable. </p><p>Now, even if this is my first letter, may I </p><p>please make one little criticism? Brundage’s </p><p>gals are really delightful in form and color- </p><p>ing, and I love to copy them to see how </p><p>nearly I can approximate her figures—but— </p><p>her expressions are so terribly monotonous. </p><p>I always know just what the faces will look </p><p>like before I see the cover. It’s the eyes that </p><p>do the dirty work. No horror, no nothing in </p><p>them. They look as tho' they were all </p><p>poured from the same mold.

I sat down at once and </p><p>wrote it out roughly, with my apartment for </p><p>setting and my wife and myself for char- </p><p>acters. It was almost morning when I wrote </p><p>'The End,’ and I laid it aside, then polished </p><p>it up the following evening. After that I </p><p>took it to Julius Schwartz, my agent. With </p><p>him was Mort Weisinger. They glanced over </p><p>the story, and their mouths fell open. 'Look </p><p>here,’ they said, both at once. ’Not five days </p><p>ago we were discussing-’ After that they </p><p>told the story Mr. Ryan tells, of how they </p><p>imagined die Necronomicon materializing </p><p>through the combined mental effort of many </p><p>readers of Lovecraft’s tales. Yet neither had </p><p>communicated with me, as both will be </p><p>ready to testify. We laughingly decided it </p><p>was a case of thought-transference—an un- </p><p>conscious mental message sent and received. </p><p>I wonder if anybody has a better explana- </p><p>tion.” </p><p>A Conte Cruel </p><p> J. Vernon Shea, Jr., of Pittsburgh, writes:</p><p>"The October number is another good issue. </p><p>I read The Shunned House with a feeling of </p><p>sadness, for the many references to Provi- </p><p>dence made it seem a post-delayed letter </p><p>from H. P. L. The story is not quite of his </p><p>best, for it has the over-slow approach and </p><p>the lingering on technicalities that marked </p><p>some of his last work; nevertheless, the cul- </p><p>mination is startling, and the artistry veri- </p><p>tably impeccable. I doubt if any of your</p><p>writers will ever quite attain the high stand- </p><p>ard of Lovecraft at his best. Tiger Cat is one </p><p>of the best things Doctor Keller has done, </p><p>but the story falls into the genre of the conte </p><p>cruel rather than of the weird tale proper. </p><p>Nowadays die conte cruel is a little passe, </p><p>for the horrors of war narrated in any news- </p><p>paper far surpass the artificial horrors. </p><p>Quinn’s tale is better than usual, almost in </p><p>the vein of his The Phantom Farmhouse; </p><p>Wellman again rings the bell with The Gol- </p><p>otba Dancers, and Habl’s The Long Arm is </p><p>ifferent. More European writers should be </p><p>represented in Weird Tales. I read with </p><p>distaste Peirce’s The Homicidal Diary, an </p><p>hysterical and cheap melodrama; to dem- </p><p>onstrate its inadequacy, compare it with Mrs. </p><p>Belloc Lownde’s brilliant handling of a simi- </p><p>lar theme, The Lodger, or with such motion </p><p>pictures as M and Night Must Fall. It oc- </p><p>curs to me that the Eyrie readers might be </p><p>interested in some statistics. For instance, </p><p>which writer has appeared most frequently </p><p>in WT? Quinn? Derleth? Howard? Why </p><p>not give a chart, listing the most printed </p><p>writers, and giving such data as number of </p><p>serials, number of novelettes, number of </p><p>short stories, number of 'short shorts,’ num- </p><p>ber of poems, number of reprints?” [We </p><p>fear that such statistical data would interest </p><p>only a select few of our readers, and would </p><p>take up space that could otherwise be used </p><p>for stories.—The Editor.] </p><p>Happy vs. Unhappy Endings </p><p> Clifton Hall, of Los Angeles, writes: "I</p><p>thought the second part of Hamilton’s new </p><p>serial, The Lake of Life, was the best story </p><p>in the Octobcr number. It reminds one a </p><p>little of a dime thriller, but makes fasci- </p><p>nating reading. Tiger Cat, by Keller, stands </p><p>second, in my estimation, although I think </p><p>it was a mistake to reveal the nature of the </p><p>cellar’s contents by means of the blurb and </p><p>the two illustrations. Third spot, I think, </p><p>should go to Quinn’s Pledged to the Deatl. </p><p>However, I have one criticism to make in </p><p>connection with die de Grandin series: if </p><p>I’d had as many dozen hair-raising experi- </p><p>ences with creatures from another world as </p><p>Trowbridge has had, I don’t diink I’d have </p><p>to be convinced during every new adventure </p><p>that ’such things are possible.’ Yet I cannot </p><p>recall a de Grandin story in which the </p><p>Frenchman has not had to argue for some </p><p>minutes with his skeptical friend before the</p><p>latter realizes that the improbable is not </p><p>necessarily die impossible. Lovecraft’s last </p><p>was okay, I guess, but I didn’t think the </p><p>climax stupendous enough to justify the </p><p>long and at times tedious building-up proc- </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>765 </p><p>ess. The Homicidal Diary I considered to </p><p>be the best of the others. The orange-haired </p><p>creature on the cover stood out brightly </p><p>against the dark background—an arresting </p><p>bit of work. But how about another Fin Jay </p><p>cover? It’s been four mondis since his last. </p><p>And now for G. M. Wilson, who says that </p><p>Weird Tales is not an interesting book be- </p><p>cause everyone knows that everything will </p><p>come out hunky-dory! I checked back over </p><p>the stories—exactly 90 of them, including </p><p>reprints—that have appeared in the ten is- </p><p>sues dated 1937, and found out a surprizing </p><p>fact. The'"' was an exact split—45-45— </p><p>between the happy and unhappy endings! </p><p>Of course, it was difficult to definitely place </p><p>many yarns in either classification, but in </p><p>the end the advantage lay on neither side. </p><p>It is improbable that in any other magazine </p><p>can you find such an amazing balance in </p><p>endings.” </p><p>The October Issue </p><p> Julius Hopkins, of Washington, D. C.,</p><p>writes: "The October WT is a real treat </p><p>for any lover of weird fiction. Two excel- </p><p>lent stories vie closely for first place, namely: </p><p>The Shunned House by H. P. Lovecraft and </p><p>The Homicidal Diary by Earl Peirce, Jr. I </p><p>am giving the slim edge to Mr. Peirce be- </p><p>cause in his story the horror is still at large </p><p>and, furthermore, is of great current interest </p><p>because actually the famous Cleveland be- </p><p>header has not been captured yet, and not </p><p>even any clues as to his identity have been </p><p>found. The Homicidal Diary is written in </p><p>plain convincing language and certainly does </p><p>make your heart beat fast, especially in that </p><p>scene where Jason Carse is rapidly becoming </p><p>over-excited and the sharp butcher knife is </p><p>close at hand. That’s a real spine-chilling </p><p>scene for you. The Shunned House is an- </p><p>other typical Lovecraft tale written as only </p><p>H. P. L. could ever have done it. The slow </p><p>summation of facts builds a solid foundation </p><p>for the surprize ending. The big horrible </p><p>surprize, though so terrible it seems unbe- </p><p>lievable, becomes a reality under the master- </p><p>ful handling of this marvelous writer who </p><p>has sadly passed on into the great beyond. </p><p>I award second place to The Shunned House, </p><p>but this time second place is really a second </p><p>first place.

C., Jr. </p><p> What a break for the Washington Weird</p><p>Tales Club! Seabury Quinn, who reads the </p><p>fashion magazines so his heroines may be </p><p>clothed stylishly, is shipping the furniture </p><p>from Brooklyn to Washington. ... As if to </p><p>compensate for the Old Marster’s absence </p><p>from die skyscraper city, Earl Peirce, Jr., and </p><p>Bruce Bryan may migrate to NYC, taking </p><p>up writing as a regular profession. . . . H. P. </p><p>Lovecraft’s Psychopompos, "a tale in rime,” </p><p>was one of his earliest efforts, dating from </p><p>1917. . . . Virgil Finlay seldom uses models, </p><p>but refers occasionally to photographs to get </p><p>the right effect in picturing various textures. </p><p>Virgil was born in Rochester, New York, </p><p>twenty-three years ago. His first attempt at </p><p>drawing occurred at the tender age of three, </p><p>when the magnificently limned equine of his </p><p>imagination was labeled "doggy” by his </p><p>mother. He attended several grammar </p><p>schools in and about Rochester; and his first </p><p>real claim to fame was established when </p><p>block-print caricatures of his teachers were </p><p>reproduced in the John Marshall High </p><p>School paper. He studied at Mechanics In- </p><p>stitute classes and the gallery in Rochester. </p><p>He has exhibited in oils, pen and ink, pencil, </p><p>and block-print, and also works in tempera, </p><p>transparent water color, charcoal, wood-cut, </p><p>stone, chalk, and clay—preferring pen and </p><p>ink to them all. Virgil is a quiet young man, </p><p>unmarried, with a serious face that often </p><p>lights up with a broad smile. Athletics in </p><p>earlier years won him a fourteen-inch bicep </p><p>and stubby, powerful fingers. He often </p><p>spends two or three days on a single draw- </p><p>ing for Weird Tales, beginning work </p><p>around noon and ceasing only when dawn </p><p>tinges the night sky. A dreamless sleep then </p><p>shuts him from the material world until noon </p><p>again, when he repeats the process. He has </p><p>a keen sense of humor. And the way he </p><p>plays practical jokes on his fellow Weird- </p><p>ists! For instance: Clifford Ball once stated </p><p>in a letter to the Eyrie, previous to publica- </p><p>tion of his first story, that the ridiculous </p><p>theme of a woman’s being captured and car- </p><p>ried off by a giant ape was passe. With this </p><p>in mind, Virgil selected that particular scene </p><p>in illustrating Ball’s Thief of Fort he! . . . </p><p>What is perhaps his most famous drawing, </p><p>the strange, dark illustration for Robert </p><p>Bloch’s The Faceless God, was the result of</p><p>a dilemma: In the story there was little ac- </p><p>tion which could be portrayed graphically, </p><p>NEXT MONTH </p><p> Hairy Ones</p><p> Shall Dance</p><p>By Gans T. Field </p><p>A strange story is this—the story of </p><p>•	a stage magician whose investiga-</p><p>tions of spirit seances precipitated him </p><p>into the midst of an astounding situa- </p><p>tion. It is a tale of terror and sudden </p><p>death, a tale of the hideous, stark hor- </p><p>ror that struck during a seance, a tale </p><p>of the frightful thing that laired in the </p><p>Devil’s Croft. </p><p>This is an unusual story indeed, </p><p>and one that will hold your inter- </p><p>est throughout by the spell of its weird </p><p>happenings.

He considers his </p><p>conception of Sterling’s vampire (in this is- </p><p>sue) about the best he has done for WT, </p><p>and is most enthusiastic over the poetry </p><p>series it introduces. He is a Shakespeare and </p><p>Milton fan. He generally does considerable </p><p>research and experimentation in preparing </p><p>for any particularly difficult piece of work. </p><p>Before painting the cover for Speer’s Sym- </p><p>phony of the Damned, he modeled the three </p><p>figures in clay and played lights on them </p><p>from below in order to get the correct light- </p><p>ing effect. . . . Paintings and other samples </p><p>of the media he employs are to be seen </p><p>everywhere in the Finlay residence. His </p><p>studio, of course, is full of them. An excel- </p><p>lent portrait of his mother adorns the upper </p><p>hallway, and still-life paintings hang down- </p><p>stairs in parlor and dining-room. The attic </p><p>shelters a whole flock of diem, while scores </p><p>of drawings rest under tables and benches in </p><p>the wood-working shop outside. The bath- </p><p>room chest-of-drawers resembles a portable </p><p>art gallery. . . . Virgil is a favorite cor- </p><p>respondent of many notables in the fantasy </p><p>field, as evidenced by the remarks they have </p><p>passed in letters to me. To them he is weird- </p><p>ly known as "Monstro Ligriv.” His high- </p><p>school nickname was, curiously, ‘'Hyphen”— </p><p>an abbreviated form of the salutation, "Hi, </p><p>Finlay!” He says his biggest thrill came </p><p>when an old Italian he knew, after seeing </p><p>some of Virgil’s drawings, turned his back </p><p>and crossed himself. </p><p>Concise Comments </p><p> Richard F. Jamison, of Valley Park, Mis-</p><p>souri, writes: "If anyone is fated to equal </p><p>Lovecraft’s genius Henry Kuttncr is that </p><p>man. His stories have that indescribable </p><p>something that every truly weird story must </p><p>have.” </p><p> Jean Van Wissink, of Chicago, writes:</p><p>"If all pages of the October issue but those </p><p>of The Dike of Life had been blank, I’d</p><p>still have had my money’s worth! Edmond </p><p>Hamilton seems especially worth hanging </p><p>on to.” </p><p> R. N. Nicholaieff, of Chicago, writes:</p><p>’'Lovecraft’s The Shunned House rates first </p><p>place in the October issue. I read this tale </p><p>three times just because I liked the way it </p><p>was written. Lovecraft was indeed a master </p><p>of weird fiction.” </p><p> Seymour Kapetansky, of Detroit, writes:</p><p>"No two writing styles could have been fur- </p><p>ther apart than those of H. P. Lovecraft and </p><p>Robert E. Howard, yet both were masters of </p><p>weird fantasy. It’s lucky we have such tal- </p><p>ented writers as Henry Kuttner and Robert </p><p>Bloch to carry on.” </p><p> A. V. Pershing, of Anderson, Indiana,</p><p>writes: "Hamilton’s The Lake of Life is </p><p>weird and extremely interesting. As fine as </p><p>he already is, lie’s getting better.” </p><p> Edward Landberg, of Brooklyn, writes:</p><p>"In 1931-32 you published two reprint nov- </p><p>els, Frankenstein by Mrs. Shelley and The </p><p>Wolf-Leader by Dumas, of which the read- </p><p>ers disapproved. You then stated that you </p><p>would cease to publish serial reprints. That </p><p>was a mistake. If you don’t mind my saying </p><p>so, it was not the idea of the serial reprints </p><p>that the readers disliked, although at first </p><p>glance it would seem so, but it was the </p><p>stories you chose. They really were not fit </p><p>for a modern reader’s consumption.” </p><p> Henry Kuttner writes from Beverly Hills,</p><p>California: “I enjoyed most of the talcs in </p><p>the September issue, and the ones I did not </p><p>shall go unnamed. Bruce Bryan makes a </p><p>highly auspicious debut, and his familiarity </p><p>with his subject lent a pleasing air of authen- </p><p>ticity to The Ho-Ho-Kam Horror. As for </p><p>School for the Unspeakable, I’ve developed </p><p>into an ardent Wellman fan since reading </p><p>such little masterpieces as this and The </p><p>Kelpie </p><p>Most Popular Story </p><p> Readers, what is your favorite story in this</p><p>issue? If you have any likes and dislikes, </p><p>we shall be glad to hear about them.

In the October issue, three stories</p><p>are exactly tied for first place as this issue </p><p>goes to press. They are Tiger Cat by David </p><p>H. Keller, Pledged to the Dead by Seabury </p><p>Quinn, and The Shunned House by the late </p><p>H. P. Lovecraft. </p><p> W. T.—8</p><p>COMING NEXT MONTH </p><p>KLAUS kicked aside the curtain ar the doorway and looked into the darkness of the </p><p>little- house. A woman crouched cross-legged on the earthen floor, her hair unbound, </p><p>. her gown ripped open to expose her breasts. On her knees, very quiet, but not sleep- </p><p>ing, lay a baby boy, and on the little breast there flowered a crimson wound. Klaus recog- </p><p>nized it—a gladiator knew the trademark of his calling!—a sword-cut. Half a hand’s-span </p><p>long, ragged at the edges, sunk so deep into the baby flesh that the glinting white of breast- </p><p>bone showed between the raw wound's gaping, bloody lips. </p><p> "Who hath done this thing?” The Northman’s eyes were hard as fjord-ice, and a grim-</p><p>ness set upon his bearded lips like that they wore when he faced a Cappadocian netman </p><p>in the circus. "Who hath done this to thee, woman?” </p><p> The young Jewess looked up from her keening. Her eyes were red and swollen with</p><p>much weeping, and the tears had cut small rivulets into the dust with which her face was </p><p>smeared, but even in her agony she showed some traces of her wonted beauty. </p><p> "The soldiers,” she replied between breath-breaking sobs. "They came and smote anil</p><p>slew; there is not a man-child left alive in all the village. Oh, my son, my little son, why </p><p>did they do this thing to thee, thou who never did them any harm? Oh, woe is me; my </p><p>firstborn, only son is slain-” </p><p> "Thou liest, woman!” Klaus’s words rang sharp as steel. "Soldiers do not do things like</p><p>this. They war with men, they make no war on babes.” </p><p> The mother rocked her body to and fro and beat her breast with small clenched fists.</p><p>"The soldiers did it,” she repeated doggedly. "They came and went from house to house, </p><p>and slew our sons-” </p><p> "Romans?” Klaus asked incredulously. Cruel the Romans were at times, but never to</p><p>his knowledge had they done a thing like this. Romans were not baby-killc-rs. </p><p> "Nay, the soldiers of the King. Romans only in the armor that they wore. They came</p><p>marching into town, and-” </p><p> "The soldiers of the King? Herod?” . . .</p><p> You cannot afford to miss this mystic story of the Yule-tide and a barbarian from the</p><p>North in the Roman army; a reverent tale of the Crucifixion, and Pontius Pilate, and a </p><p>hetaera from the house of Mary the Magdalene.
