A few burning words that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the cause of the turning point in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a hot flush of shame I turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the store, and walked rapidly home.

"He's got a wish-bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">where his back-bone ought to be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I thought over the words in deep hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliation, a sudden thought made me catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">my breath.

Did Mary secretly think that too?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after all, wasn't it true that I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"wish-bone" where my back-bone ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be? Wasn't that why I never had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"chance" to get ahead? It was true, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">too true--and it had taken this cruel blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my self-esteem to make me see it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a new determination I thumbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages of a magazine on the table, searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an advertisement that I'd seen many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times but passed up without thinking, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertisement telling of big opportunities</seg><seg type="columnLine">for trained men to succeed in the great new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio field. With the advertisement was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupon offering a big free book full of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. I sent the coupon in, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days received a handsome 64-page</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, printed in two colors, telling all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opportunities in the Radio field and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man can prepare quickly and easily at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home to take advantage of these opportuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. I read the book carefully, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished it I made my decision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT'S happened in the twelve months</seg><seg type="columnLine">since that day, as I've already told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, seems almost like a dream to me now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For ten of those twelve months, I've had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio business of my own!

It wasn't long before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting so much to do in the Radio line</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I quit my measly little clerical job, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted my full time to my Radio business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since that time I've gone right on up, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways under the watchful guidance of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends at the National Radio Institute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would have given me just as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">help, too, if I had wanted to follow some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other line of Radio besides building my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own retail business--such as broadcasting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturing, experimenting, sea operat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, or any one of the score of lines they</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare you for.

Accordingly, we made an experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment last summer and issued the Amazing Story Year</seg><seg type="columnLine">Book, wherein we featured Edgar Rice Burroughs' story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Master Mind of Mars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although this book sold at 50c, it enjoyed an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale, and we became convinced that tln*re certainly was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand for more Amazing Stories. Therefore, it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been decided that as a supplement to Amazing Stories, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will now publish an Amazing Stories Quarterly. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be published four times a year and will be on the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands on the following dates:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">January 20th	July 20th</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">April 20th	October 20th</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In make-up, it will be similar to the Annual.

Smoke had</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated above the mountain and once the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk passing near had heard subterranean noises, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explainable rumblings. A glow in the sky had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned the summit at night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When the wind blew the smoky cloud eastward</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Pleasant Garden, a lew cinders and ashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted down from it. And finally, one stormy night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale flames, reflected from the clouds above the sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit, cast upon the district below a sinister, warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In presence of these strange phenomena, it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing that the people of ,the surrounding dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict became seriously disquieted. And to the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet was joined an imperious need of knowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true condition of the mountain. The Carolina news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers had flaring headlines, "The Mystery of Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyrie." I hey asked if it was not dangerous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwell in such a region. Their articles aroused curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity and fear--curiosity among those who, being in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no danger themselves, were interested in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbance merely as a strange phenomenon of nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear in those who were likely to be the victims, if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe actually occurred. Those more immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately threatened were the citizens of Morganton, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more the, good folk of Pleasant Garden and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hamlets and farms yet closer to the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Assuredly it was regrettable that mountain climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had not previously attempted to ascend to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of the Great Eyrie. The cliffs of rock which</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded it had never been scaled. Perhaps they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might offer no path by which even the most daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">climber could penetrate to the interior. Yet, if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic eruption menaced all the western region of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Carolinas, then a complete examination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain was oecome absolutely necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now before the actual ascent of the crater, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">------ - its many serious difficul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, was attempted, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one way which offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity of recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noitering the interior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without clambering up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipices. In the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of September of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">memorable year, a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known aeronaut named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilker came to Morgan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton with his balloon.

Thus he would know if the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a volcano really opened amid the mighty rocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the principal question. I f this were settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be known whether the surrounding country</seg><seg type="columnLine">must fear an eruption at some period more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The ascension was begun according to the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram suggested. The wind was fair and steady;</seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1028</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky clear; the morning clouds were disappearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the vigorous rays of the sun. If the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Eyrie was not filled with smoke, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeronaut would be able to search with his glass its</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire extent. If the vapors were rising, he, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, could detect their source.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The balloon rose at once to a height of fifteen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet, and there rested almost motionless for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of an hour. Evidently the east wind,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which was brisk upon the surface of the earth, did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not make itself felt at that height. Then by an un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lucky chance, the balloon was caught in an adverse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">current, and began to drift toward the east. Its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distance from the mountain chain rapidly increased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Despite all the efforts of the aeronaut, the citizens</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Morganton saw the balloon disappear on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wrong horizon. Later, they learned that it ,had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">landed in the neighborhood of Raleigh, the capital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of North Carolina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This attempt having failed, it was agreed that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should be tried again under better conditions. In-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deed, fresh rumblings were heard from the moun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain, accompanied by heavy cloudy and wavering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glimmerings of light at night. Folk began to realize</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the Great Eyrie was a serious and perhaps immi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nent source of danger. Yes, the entire country lay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under the threat of some seismic or volcanic disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During the first days of April of that year, these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more or less vague apprehensions turned to actual</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panic. The newspapers gave prompt echo to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">public terror. The entire district between the moun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tains and Morganton was sure that an eruption was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The night of the fourth of April, the good folk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Pleasant Garden were awakened by a sudden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">uproar. They thought that the mountains were fall-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing upon them. They rushed from their houses,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready for instant flight, fearing to see open before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them some immense abyss, engulfing the farms and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">villages for miles around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The night was very dark. A weight of heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds pressed down upon the plain. Even had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">been day the crest of the mountains would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the midst of this impenetrable obscurity, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was no response to the cries which arose from every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side. Frightened groups of men, women, and chil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dren groped their way along the black roads in wild</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">confusion. From every quarter came the scream-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing voices: "It is an earthquake." "It is an erup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion." "Whence comes it?" "From the Great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Eyrie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Into Morganton sped the news that stones, lava,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ashes, were raining down upon the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shrewd citizens of the town, however, observed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that if there were an eruption the noise would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">continued and increased, the flames would have ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peared above the crater; or at least their lurid reflec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions would have penetrated the clouds. Now, even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these reflections were no longer seen. If there had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been an earthquake, the terrified people saw that at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">least their houses had not crumbled beneath the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shock. It was possible that the uproar had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caused by an avalanche, or by the fall of some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mighty rock from the summit of the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  An hour passed without further incident. A wind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the west sweeping over the long chain of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">P.lue Ridge, set the pines and hemlocks wailing on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the higher slopes. There seemed no new cause for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panic; and folk bfcgan to return to their houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All, however, awaited impatiently the return of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then suddenly, toward three o'clock in the morn-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing, came another alarm. Flames leaped up above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rocky wall of the Great Eyrie. Reflected from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the clouds, they illuminated the atmosphere for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great distance. A crackling, as if of many burning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trees, was heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Had a fire spontaneously broken out? And to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what cause was it due? Lightning could not have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started the conflagration, for no thunder had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard. True, there was plenty of material for fire;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at this height the chain of the Blue Ridge is well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wooded. But these flames were too sudden for any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ordinary cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "An eruption!" "An eruption!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The cry resounded from all sides. An eruption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Great Eyrie was then indeed the crater of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">volcano buried in the bowels of the mountains. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after so many years, so many ages even, had it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reawakened? Added to the flames, was a rain of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stones and ashes about to follow ? Were the lavas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going to pour down torrents of molten fire, destroy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing everything in their passage, annihilating the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">towns, the villages, the farms, all this beautiful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world of meadows, fields and forests, even as far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as Pleasant Garden and Morganton ?,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This time the panic was overwhelming; nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'could stop it. Women, crazed with terror, carrying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their infants, rushed along the eastward roads.

Two days before, the head of the federal</seg><seg type="columnLine">police had called me to his room. He was awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with some impatience. "John Strock," s^id he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"are you still the man who on so many occasions has</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven to me both his devotion and his ability?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Ward," 1 answered with a bow, "I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise success or even ability, but as to devotion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I assure 34011, it is yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do not doubt it," responded the chief. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will ask you instead this more exact question: Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you as fond of riddles as ever?

He had several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrusted to me difficult missions which I had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished successfully, and which had won me his</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence. For several months past, however, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found no occasion for my services. Therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">I awaited with impatience what he had to say. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not doubt that his questioning implied a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and important task for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doubtless you know," said he, "what has hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened down in the Blue Ridge Mountains near</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morganton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely, Mr. Ward.

I doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and believe a resolute attempt may bring success."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing is impossible, Mr. War|l: what we. face</seg><seg type="columnLine">here is merely a question of expense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must not regard expense when we are seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to reassure an entire population, or to preserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from a catastrophe. There is another suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would make to you. Perhaps this Great Eyrie is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not so inaccessible as is supposed. Perhaps a band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of malefactors have secreted themselves there, gain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing access by ways known only to themselves."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What, you suspect that robbers--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps I am wrong, Strock; and these strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sights and sounds have all had natural causes.

If some volcano in the Alleghanies</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatens North Carolina with a disaster similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of Martinique, buried beneath the outpourings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mont Pelee, then these people must leave their</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope, sir, there is no such widespread danger."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think not, Strock; it seems to me highly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable that an activc volcano exists in the Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ridge mountain chain. Our Appalachian mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">system is nowhere volcanic in its origin. But all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these events cannot be without basis. In short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strock, we have decided to make a strict inquiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the phenomena of the Great Eyrie, to gather all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the testimony, to question the people of the towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and farms. To do this, I have made choice of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent in whom we have full confidence; and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent is you, Strock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good.

There I passed the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the course of the next afternoon arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railroad station of Morganton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morganton is but a small town, built upon strata</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Jurassic period, particularly rich in coal. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">1030</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mines give it some prosperity. It also has numer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous unpleasant mineral waters, so that the season</seg><seg type="columnLine">there attracts many visitors. Around Morganton is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rich farming country, with broad fields of grain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It lies in the midst of swamps, covered with mosses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reeds. Evergreen forests rise high up the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain slopes. All that the region lacks is the wells of</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural gas, that invaluable natural source of power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and warmth, so abundant in most of the Alle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghany valleys. Villages and farms are numerous up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the very borders of the mountain forests. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were many thousands of people threatened, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Eyrie proved indeed a volcano, if the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsions of nature extended to Pleasant Garden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Morganton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mayor of Morganton, Mr. Elias Smith*, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tall man, vigorous and enterprising, forty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old or more, and of a health to defy all the doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two Americas. He was a great hunter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bears and panthers, beasts which may still be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wild gorges and mighty forests of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alleghanies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Smith was himself a rich land-owner, pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessing several farms in the neighborhood. Even his</seg><seg type="columnLine">most distant tenants received frequent visits from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Indeed, whenever his official duties did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep him in his so-called home at Morganton, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exploring the surrounding country, irresistibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn by the instincts of the hunter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went at once to the house of Mr. Smith. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was expecting me, having been warned by telegram.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He received me very frankly, without any formality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pipe in his mouth, a glass of brandy on the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A second glass was brought in by a servant, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to drink to my host before beginning our</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Ward sent you," said he to me in a jovial</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone. "Good; let us drink to Mr. Ward's health."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I clinked glasses with him, and drank in honor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief of police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now," demanded Elias Smith, "what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worrying him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this I made known to the mayor of Morganton</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause and the purpose of my mission in North</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carolina. I assured him that my chief had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me full power, and would render me every assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, financial and otherwise, to solve the riddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieve the neighborhood of its anxiety relative to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elias Smith listened to me without uttering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, but not without several times refilling his glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mine. While he puffed steadily at his pipe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">close attention which he gave me was beyond ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I saw his cheeks flush at times, and his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam under their bushy brows. Evidently the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">magistrate of Morganton was uneasy about Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyrie, and would be as eager as I to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of these phenomena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I had finished my communication, Elias</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith gazed at me for some moments in silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he said, softly, "So at Washington they wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know what the Great Eyrie hides within its</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuit ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Mr. Smith."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, also?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So do I, Mr. Strock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and I were as one in our curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will understand," added he, knocking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinders from his pipe, "that as a land-owner, I am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">much interested in these stories of the Great Eyrie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as mayor, I wish to protect my constituents."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A double reason," I commented, "to stimulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to discover the cause of these extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurrences!

For on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, I do not believe it possible that the Great Eyrie</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be a volcano; the Alleghanies are nowhere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic origin. I, myself, in our immediate district,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have never found any geological traces of scoria, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava, or any eruptive rock whatever. I do not think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, that Morganton can possibly be threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from such a source."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You really think not, Mr. Smith ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But these tremblings of the earth that have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt in the neighborhood!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, these tremblings! These tremblings!" re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated Mr. Smith, shaking his head; "but in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, is it certain that there have been tremblings?</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the moment when the flames showed most sharply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was on my farm of Wildon, less than a mile from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Eyrie. There was certainly a tumult in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, but I felt no quivering of the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But in the reports sent to Mr. Ward--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reports made under the impulse of the panic,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted the mayor of Morganton. "I said noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of any earth tremors in mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But as to the flames which rose clearly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crest ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, as to those, Mr. Strock, that is different. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them; saw them with my own eyes, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds certainly reflected them for miles around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, noises certainly came from the crater of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Eyrie, hissings, as if a great boiler were</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting off steam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have reliable testimony of this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, the evidence of my own ears."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And in the midst of this noise, Mr. Smith, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you believe that you heard that most remarkable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the phenomena, a sound like the flapping of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so, Mr. Strock; but what mighty bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">could this be, which flew away after the flames had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died down, and what wings could ever make such</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous sounds. I therefore seriously question,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if this must not have been a deception of my im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agination. The Great Eyrie a refuge for unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters of the sky! Would they not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen long since, soaring above their immense nest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone ? In short, there is in all this a mystery, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has not yet been solved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we will solve it, Mr. Smith, if you will give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me your aid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely, Mr. Strock; to-morrow we will start our</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To-morrow." And on that word the mayor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I separated. I went to a hotel, and established my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for a stay which might be indefinitely prolonged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, having dined, and written to Mr. Ward, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Mr. Smith again in the afternoon, and arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave Morganton with him at daybreak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our first purpose was to undertake the ascent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain, with the aid of two experienced guides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These men had ascended Mt.

They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never, however, attempted the Great Eyrie, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that its walls of inaccessible cliffs defended it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER OF THE WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1031</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">every side. Moreover, before the recent startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurrences, the Great Eyrie had not particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted the attention of tourists. Mr. Smith knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two guides personally as men daring, skillful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trustworthy. They would stop at no obstacle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we were resolved to follow them through every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Moreover, Mr. Smith remarked at the last that</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps it was no longer as difficult as formerly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate within the Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And why ?" asked L</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Because a huge block has recently broken away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mountainside and perhaps it has left a</seg><seg type="columnLine">practicable path or entrance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That would be a fortunate chance.

Elias Smith and I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morganton by a road which, winding along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left bank of the Catawba River, led to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village of Pleasant Garden. The guides accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied us, Harry Horn, a man of thirty, and James</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brack, aged twenty-five. They were both natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the region, and in constant demand among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tourists who climbed the peaks of the Blue Ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Cumberland Mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A light wagon with two good horses was provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry us to the foot of the range. It contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions for two or three days, beyond which our</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip surely would not be protracted. Mr. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown himself a generous provider both in</seg><seg type="columnLine">meats and in liquors. As to water, the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs would furnish it in abundance, increased by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy rains, frequent in that region during</seg><seg type="columnLine">springtime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is needless to add that the Mayor of Morgan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton in his role of hunter, had brought along his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his dog, Nisko, who gamboled joyously about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon. Nisko, however, was to remain behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the farm at Wildon, when we attempted our</seg><seg type="columnLine">asccnt. He could not possibly follow us up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Eyrie with its cliffs lo scale and its crevasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The day was beautiful, the fresh air in that cli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate is still cool of an April morning. A few fleecy</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds sped rapidly overhead, driven by a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze which swept across the long plains, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant Atlantic. The sun, peeping forth at inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals, illumined all the fresh young verdure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An entire world animated the woods through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we passed. From before our equipage fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirrels, field-mice, parroquets of brilliant colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deafening loquacity. Oppossums passed in hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried gait, bearing their young in their pouches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Myriads of birds were scattered amid the foliage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of maples, pines and masses of rhododendrons, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxuriant that their thickets were impenetrable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We arrived that evening at Pleasant Garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we were comfortably located for the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the mayor of the town, a particular friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Smith. Pleasant Garden proved little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a village; but its mayor gave us a warm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">generous reception, and we supped pleasantly in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">charming home, which stood beneath the shades of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some giant beech-trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally the conversation turned upon our at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to explore the interior of the Great Eyrie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are right," said our host, "until we all know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is hidden within there, our people will remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Has nothing new occurred," I asked, "since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last appearance of flames above the Great Eyrie?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing, Mr. Strock. From Pleasant Garden we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see the entire crest of the mountain. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious noise has come down to us. Not a spark</seg><seg type="columnLine">has risen. T f a legion of devils is in hiding there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must have finished their infernal cookery, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared away to some other haunt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Devils!" cried Mr. Smith. "Well, I hope they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not decamped without leaving some traces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their occupation, some parings of hoofs or horns</seg><seg type="columnLine">or their tails. We shall find them out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the morrow, the twenty-ninth of April, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">started again at dawn. By the end of this second</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, we expected to reach the farm of Wildon at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of the mountain. The country was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as before, except that our road led more</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeply upward. Woods and marshes alternated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the latter grew sparser, being drained by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun as we approached the higher levels. The coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try was also less populous. There were only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">little hamlets, almost lost beneath the beech trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few lonely farms, abundantly watered by the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams that rushed downward toward the Catawba</seg><seg type="columnLine">River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (he smaller birds and beasts grew yet more</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous. "I am much tempted to" take my gun,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mr. Smith, "and to go off with Nisko. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be the first time that I have passed here with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out trying my luck with the partridges and hares.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'1'he good beasts will not recognize me. But not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only have we plenty of provisions, but we have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger chase on hand to-day. The chase of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And let us hope," added I, "we do not come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed hunters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the afternoon the whole chain of the Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ridge stretched before us at a distance of only six</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles. The mountain crests were sharply outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the clear sky. Well wooded at the base, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew more bare and showed only stunted evergreens</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the summit. There the scraggly trees, gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesquely twisted, gave to the rocky heights a bleak</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bizarre appearance. Here and there the ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in sharp peaks. On our right the Black Moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, nearly seven thousand feet high, reared their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic head, sparkling at times high above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you ever climbed that mountain, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," answered he, "but I am told that it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very difficult ascent. A few mountaineers have</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed it; but they report that it has no outlook</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanding the crater of the Great Eyrie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is so," said the guide, Harry Horn. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried it myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps." suggested I. "the weather was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the contrary, Mr. Strock, it was unusually</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. But the wall of the Great Eyrie on that side</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose so high, it completely hid the interior."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Forward." cried Mr. Smith. "I shall not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">1032</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry to set foot where 110 person has ever stepped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or even looked, before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certainly on this day the Great Eyrie looked tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quil enough. As we gazed upon it, there rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its heights neither smoke nor flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward live o'clock our expedition halted at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wildon farm, where the tenants warmly welcomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their landlord. The farmer assured us that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">notable had happened about the Great Eyrie for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time. We supped at a common table with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people of the farm; and our sleep that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sound and wholly untroubled by premonitions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the morrow, before break of day, we set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ascent of the mountain. The height of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Eyrie scarce exceeds five thousand feet. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">modest altitude, often surpassed in this section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Appalachians. As we were already more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">three thousand feet above sea level, the fatigue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ascent could not be great. A few hours should</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffice to bring us to the edge of the crater. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, difficulties might present themselves, preci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pices to scale, clefts and breaks in the ridge might</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessitate painful and even dangerous detours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the unknown, the spur to our attempt. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, our guides knew no more than we upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point. What made me anxious, was, of course, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common report that the Great Eyrie was wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaccessible. But this remained unproven. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then there was the new chance that a fallen block</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left a breach in the rock wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At last," said Mr. Smith to me, after lighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first pipe of the twenty or more which he smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">each day, "we are well started. As to whether the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent will take more or less time-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In any case, Mr. Smith," interrupted I, "you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I are fully resolved to pursue our quest to the end."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fully resolved, Mr. Strock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My chief has charged me to snatch the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this demon of the Great Eyrie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will snatch it from him, willing or unwill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," vowed Mr. Smith, calling Heaven to witness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Even if we have to search the very bowels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As it may happen, then," said I, "that our ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursion will be prolonged beyond to-day, it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">well to look to our provisions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be easy, Mr. Strock; our guides have food for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days in their knapsacks, besides what we carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves. Moreover, though I left my brave Nisko</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the farm, I have my gun. Game will be plentiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woods and gorges of the lower part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain, and perhaps at the top we shall find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire to cook it, already lighted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Already lighted, Mr. Smith?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why not, Mr. Strock? These flames! These</seg><seg type="columnLine">superb flames, which have so terrified our country</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk! Is their fire absolutely cold, is no spark to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found beneath their ashes? And then, if this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly a crater, is the volcano so wholly extinct that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we cannot find there a single ember? Bah! This</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be but a poor volcano if it hasn't enough fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to cook an egg or roast a potato. Come, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeat, we shall see! We shall see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that point of the investigation I had, I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fess, no opinion formed. I had my orders to exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine the Great Eyrie. If it proved harmless, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">announce it, and people would be reassured. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">at heart, I must admit, I had the very natural desire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man possessed by the demon of curiosity. T</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be glad, both for my own sake, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">renown which would attach to my mission if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Eyrie proved the center of the most remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able phenomena--of which I would discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR ascent began in this order. The two guides</seg><seg type="columnLine">went in front to seek out the most practicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths. Elias Smith and I followed more leisurely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We mounted by a narrow and not very steep gorge</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid rocks and trees. A tiny stream trickled down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward under our feet. During the rainy season or</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a heavy shower, the water doubtless bounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">from rock to rock in tumultuous cascades. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently was fed only by the rain, for now we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely trace its course. It could not be the outlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any lake within the Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour of climbing, the slope became so</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep that we had to turn, now to the right, now to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left; and our progress was much delayed. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorge became wholly impracticable; its cliff-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides offered no sufficient foothold. We had to cling</seg><seg type="columnLine">by branches, to crawl upon our knees. At this rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top would not be reached before sundown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Faith!" cried Mr. Smith, stopping for breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I realize why the climbers of the Great Eyrie have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been few, so few, that it has never been ascended</seg><seg type="columnLine">within my knowledge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fact is," I responded, "that it would be much</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil for very little profit. And if we had not special</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons to persist in our attempt--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You never said a truer word," declared Harry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horn. "My comrade and I have scaled the Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dome several times, but we never met such obstacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">as these."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The difficulties seem almost impassable," added</seg><seg type="columnLine">James Bruck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question now was to determine to which side</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should turn for a new route; to right, as to left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose impenetrable masses of trees and bushes. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth even the scaling of cliffs would have been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy. Perhaps if we could get above this wooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope we could advance with surer foot. Now, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only go ahead blindly, and trust to the instincts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our two guides. James Bruck was especially use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. I believe that that gallant lad would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">equaled a monkey in lightness and a wild goat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">agility. Unfortunately, neither Elias Smith nor I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to climb where he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, when it is a matter of real need with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I trust I shall never be backward, being resolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">by nature and well-trained in bodily exercise. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">James Bruck went, I was determined to go, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it might cost me some uncomfortable falls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was not the same with the first magistrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Morganton, less young, less vigorous, larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stouter, and less persistent than we others. Plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made every effort, not to retard our progress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he panted like a seal, and soon I insisted on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping to rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In short, it was evident that the ascent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Eyrie would require far more time than we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had estimated. We had expected to reach the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rocky wall before eleven o'clock, but we now</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that mid-day would still find us several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet below it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward ten o'clock, after repeated attempts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover some more practicable route, after num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER OF THE WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1033</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">berless turnings and returnings, one of the guides</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the signal to halt. We found ourselves at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the upper border of the heavy wood. The trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more thinly spaced, permitted us a glimpse upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the base of the rock wall which constituted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew!" exclaimed Mr. Smith, leaning against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty pine tree, "a little respite, a little repose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even a little repast would not go badly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will rest an hour," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; after working our lungs and our legs, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will make our stomachs work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were all agreed on this point. A rest would</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly freshen us. Our only cause for inquietude</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now the appearance of the precipitous slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us. We looked up toward one of thbse bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">strips called in that region, slides. Amid tliis loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, these yielding stones, and these abrupt rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no roadway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harry Horn said to his comrade, "It will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps impossible," responded Bruck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their comments caused me secret uneasiness. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I returned without even having scaled the mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mission would be a complete failure, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking of the torture to my curiosity. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood again before Mr. Ward, shamed and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused, I should cut but a sorry figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We opened our knapsacks and lunched moderately</seg><seg type="columnLine">on bread and cold meat. Our repast finished, in less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half an hour, Mr. Smith sprang up eager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">push forward once more. James Bruck took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead; and we had only to follow him as best we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We advanced slowly. Our guides did not at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to conceal their doubt and hesitation. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horn left us and went far ahead to spy out which</seg><seg type="columnLine">road promised most chance of success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty minutes later he returned and led us</seg><seg type="columnLine">onward toward the northwest. It was on this side</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Black Dome rose at a distance of three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four miles. Our path was still difficult and painful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the sliding stones, held in place only occasion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally by wiry bushes. At length after a weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle, we gained some two hundred feet further</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward and found ourselves facing a great gash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which broke the earth at this spot. Here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scattered roots recently uptorn, branches broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, huge stones reduced to powder, as if an ava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanche had rushed down this flank of the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That must be the path taken by the huge block</seg><seg type="columnLine">which broke away from the Great Eyrie," com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented James Bruck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No doubt," answered Mr. Smith, "and I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had better follow the road that it has made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was indeed this gash that Harry Horn had</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected for our ascent. Our feet found lodgment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the firmer earth which had resisted the passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the monster rock. Our task thus became much</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier, and our progress was in a straight line up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, so that toward half past eleven we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper border of the "slide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before us, less than a hundred feet away, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering a hundred feet straight upwards in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose the rock wall, which formed the final crest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last defence of the Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From this side, the summit of the wall showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">capriciously irregular, rising in rude towers and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged needles. At one point the outline appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be an enormous eagle silhouetted against the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just ready to take flight. Upon this side, at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precipice was insurmountable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rest a minute," said Mr. Smith, "and we will .</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if it is possible to make our way around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of this cliff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At any rate," said Harry Horn, "the great block</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have fallen from this part of the cliff; and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has left no breach for entering."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were both right; we must seek entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">elsewhere. After a rest of ten minutes, we clamb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered up close to the foot of the wall, and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a circuit of its base.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Assuredly the Great Eyrie now took on to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes an aspect absolutely fantastic. Its heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed peopled by dragons and huge monsters. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimeras, griffins, and all the creations of mythology</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared to guard it, I should have been"scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With great difficulty and not without danger we</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued our tour of this circumvallation, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed that nature had worked as man does, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful regularity. Nowhere was there any break</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fortification; nowhere a fault in the strata by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which one might clamber up. Always this mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, a hundred feet in height!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour and a half of this laborious circuit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we regained our starting-place.

That was known only to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. And was the solution a matter of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance? That was beyond doubt, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety of the people of western Carolina perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet a fortnight after my return to Washington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">public attention was wholly distracted from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem by another very different in nature, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally astonishing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward the middle of that month of May the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspapers of Pennsylvania informed their readers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some strange occurrence in different parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">state. On the roads which radiated from Philadel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phia, the chief city, there circulated an extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle, of which no one could describe the form,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the nature, or even the size, so rapidly did it rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. It was an automobile; all were agreed on that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as to what motor drove it, only imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say; and when the popular imagination is</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused, what limit is there to its hypotheses?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that period the most improved automobiles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether driven by steam, gasoline, or electricity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not accomplish much more than sixty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour, a speed that the railroads, with their most</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid expresses, scarce exceed on the best lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">America and Europe. Now, this new automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was astonishing the world, traveled at more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than double this speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is needless to add that such a rate constituted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extreme danger on the highroads, as much so</seg><seg type="columnLine">for vehicles, as for pedestrians. This rushing mass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming like a thunder-bolt, preceded by a formidable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbling, caused a whirlwind, which tore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches from the trees along the road, terrified the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals browsing in adjoining fields, and scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and killed the birds, which could not resist the suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the tremendous air currents engendered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, a bizarre detail to which the newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew particular attention, the surface of the roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely even scratched by the wheels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparition, which left behind it no such ruts as are</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually made by heavy vehicles. At most there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light touch, a mere brushing of the dust. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the tremendous speed which raised behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle such whirlwinds of dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is probable." commented the Nezv York Her-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ald, "that the extreme rapidity of motion destroys</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Naturally there were protests from all sides. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible to permit the mad speed of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparition which threatened to overthrow and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroy everything in its passage, equipages and people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how could it be stopped? No one knew to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vehicle belonged, nor whence it came, nor whither</seg><seg type="columnLine">it went. It was seen but for an instant as it darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward like a bullet in its dizzy flight. How could</seg><seg type="columnLine">one seize a cannon-ball in the air, as it leaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth of the gun?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 repeat, there was no evidence as to the character</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the propelling engine. It left behind it no smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no steam, no odor of gasoline, or of any fuel oil. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed probable, therefore, that the vehicle ran by</seg><seg type="columnLine">electricity, and that its accumulators were of an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known model, using some unknown fluid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The public imagination, highly excited, readily ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted every sort of rumor about this mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile. It was said to be a supernatural car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was driven by a specter, by one of the chauffeurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hell, a goblin from another world, a monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped from some mythological menagerie, in short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil in person, who could defy all human inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention, having at his command invisible and infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satanic powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even Satan himself had no right to run at</seg><seg type="columnLine">such speed over the roads of the United States with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a special permit, without a number on his car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without a regular license. And it was certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that not a single municipality had given him per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission to go two hundred miles an hour. Public</seg><seg type="columnLine">security demanded that some means be found to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmask the secret of this terrible chauffeur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, it was not only Pennsylvania that</seg><seg type="columnLine">served as the theater of his sportive eccentricities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The police reported his appearance in other states;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Kentucky near Frankfort; in Ohio near Colum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bus; in Tennessee near Nashville; in Missouri near</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jefferson; and finally in Illinois in the neighborhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Chicago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The alarm having been given, it became the duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the authorities to take steps against this public</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. To arrest or even to halt an apparition</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving at such speed was scarcely practicable. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">better way would be to erect across the roads solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">gateways with which the flying machine must come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contact sooner or later, and be smashed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Nonsense!" declared the incredulous. "This mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would know well how to circle around such</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstructions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if necessary," added others, "the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">would leap over the barriers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And if he is indeed the devil, he has, as a former</seg><seg type="columnLine">angel, presumably preserved his wings, and so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take to flight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But this last was but the suggestion of foolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">old gossips who did not stop to study the matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For if the King of Hades possessed a pair of wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why did he obstinately persist in running around on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth at the risk of crushing his own subjects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he might more easily have hurled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space, as free as a bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Such was the situation when, in the last week of</seg><seg type="columnLine">May, a fresh event occurred, which seemed to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the United States was indeed helpless in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of some unapproachable monster.

The route laid out formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excellent track, about two hundred miles in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting from Prairie du Chien on the western fron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tier, passing by Madison and ending a little above</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milwaukee on the shore of Lake Michigan. Except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Japanese road between Nikko and Namode,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bordered by giant cypresses, there is no better track</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world than this of Wisconsin. It runs straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and level as an arrow for sometimes fifty miles at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch. Many and noted were the machines entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this great race. Every kind of motor vehicle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to compete, even motorcycles, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles. The machines were of all makes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nationalities. The sum of the different prizes reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty thousand dollars, so that the race was sure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be desperately contested. New records were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to be made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calculating on the maximum speed hitherto at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained, of perhaps eighty miles an hour, this inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national contest covering two hundred miles would</seg><seg type="columnLine">last about three hours. And, to avoid all danger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the state authorities of Wisconsin had forbidden all</seg><seg type="columnLine">other traffic between Prairie du Chien and Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waukee during three hours on the morning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirtieth of May. Thus, if there were any acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents, those who suffered would be themselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an enormous crowd; and it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed only of the people of Wisconsin. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands gathered from the neighboring states of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, and even from</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. Among the sportsmen assembled were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many foreigners, English, French, Germans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austrians, each nationality, of course, supporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chauffeurs of its land. Moreover, as this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States, the country of the greatest gamb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers of the world, bets were made of every sort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of enormous amounts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The start was to be made at eight o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning; and to avoid crowding and the accidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">which must result from it,' the automobiles were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start at two minute intervals, and race along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads whose borders were black with spectators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first ten racers, numbered by lot, were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patched between eight o'clock and twenty minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. Unless there was some disastrous accident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of these machines would surely arrive at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goal by eleven o'clock. The others would follow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour and a half had passed. There remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a single contestant at Prairie du Chien. Word</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sent back and forth by telephone every five min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes as to the order of the racers. Midway between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madison and Milwaukee, the lead was held by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine of Renault Brothers, four-cylinder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty horsepower, and with Michelin tires. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely followed by a Harvard-Watson car and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a de Dion-Bouton. Some accidents had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred, other machines were hopelessly behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not more than a dozen would contest the finish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several chauffeurs had been-injured, but not seri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. And even had they been killed, the death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men is but a detail, not considered of great impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance in that astonishing country of America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally the excitement became more intense as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one approached the finishing line near Milwaukee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were assembled the most curious, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested; and there the passions of the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unchained. By ten o'clock it was evident, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first prize, twenty thousand dollars, lay between</seg><seg type="columnLine">five machines, two American, two French, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">English. Imagine, therefore, the fury with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bets were being made under the influence of national</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. The regular book makers could scarcely meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the demands of those who wished to wajjer. Offers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and amounts were hurled from lip to lip with fever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish rapidity. "One to three on the Harvard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One to two on the de Dion-Bouton!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even money on the Renault!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These cries rang along the line of spectators at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each new announcement from the telephones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly at half-past nine by the town clock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prairie du Chien, two miles beyond that town was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a tremendous noise and rumbling which pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded from the midst of a flying cloud of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied by shrieks like those of a naval siren.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had the crowds time to draw to one side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape a destruction which would have included</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of victims. The cloud swept by like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurricane. No one could distinguish what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that passed with such speed. There was no exag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geration in saying that its rate was at least one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and fifty miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The apparition passed and disappeared in an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, leaving behind it a long train of white dust, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an express locomotive leaves behind a train of smoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently it was an automobile with a most extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary motor. If it maintained this arrow-like speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would reach the contestants in the fore-front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the race; it would pass them with this speed double</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own; it would arrive first at the goal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then from all parts arose an uproar, as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the spectators had nothing more to fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is that infernal machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; the one the police cannot stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it has not been heard of for a fortnight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was supposed to be done for, destroyed, gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a devil's car, driven by hellfire, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satan driving!" •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In truth, if he were not the devil, who could this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious chauffeur be, driving, with this unbeliev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able velocity, his no less mysterious machine?

By their esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, this amazing vehicle was going at least one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and thirty miles an hour.

The immediate purpose agreed upon was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop this projectile, to erect across its route an ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacle against which it would smash into a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces. But was there time? Would not the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear at any moment? And what need was there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the track ended on the edge of Lake Michigan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the vehicle would therefore be forced to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">there anyway, unless its supernatural driver could</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride the water as well as the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, also, as all along the route, the most extrava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gant suggestions were offered.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had passed the city, would it plunge itself to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction in the water of Lake Michigan?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate when it disappeared at a slight bend</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the road no trace was to be found of its passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the Shores of New England</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT the time when the newspapers were filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with these reports, I was again in Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">. ton. On my return I had presented myself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chief's office, but had been unable to see him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Family affairs had suddenly called him away, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">absent some weeks. Mr. Ward, however, undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly knew of the failure of my mission. The news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, especially those of North Carolina, had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">full details of our ascent of the Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, I was much annoyed by this delay which</seg><seg type="columnLine">further fretted my restless curiosity. 1 could turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to no other plans for the future. Could I give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hope of learning the secret of the Great Eyrie?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No! I would return to the attack a dozen times if</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary, and despite every failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surely, the winning of access within those walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a task beyond human power. A scaffolding</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be raised to the summit of the cliff; or a tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel might be pierced through its depth. Our engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neers met problems more difficult every day. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this case ft was necessary to consider the expense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might easily grow out of proportion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantages to be gained. A tunnel would cost many</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars, and what good would it accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plish beyond satisfying the public curiosity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My personal resources were wholly insufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the achievement. Mr. Ward, who held the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment's funds, was away. I even thought of try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to interest some millionaire. Oh, if I could but</seg><seg type="columnLine">have promised one of them some gold or silver mines</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the mountain! But such an hypothesis was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not admissible. The chain of the Appalachians is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not situated in a gold bearing region like that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pacific mountains, the Transvaal or Australia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until the fifteenth of June that Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ward returned to duty. Despite my lack of success</seg><seg type="columnLine">he received me warmly. "Here is our poor Strock!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried he, at my entrance. "Our poor Strock, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has failed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more, Mr. Ward, than if you had charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to investigate the surface of the moon," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">I.

"Both Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith, the mayor of Morganton and 4iis friend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayor of Pleasant Garden, are reliable men.

There can b"e</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt whatever of the reality of these phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomena."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Granted," declared Mr. Ward. "I admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evidence is unassailable. So the deduction to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be drawn is that the Great Eyrie has not yet given</seg><seg type="columnLine">up its secret."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we are determined to know it, Mr. Ward, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER OF THE WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1037</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">solution is only a solution of expense.

We will wait awhile and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature herself will disclose her mystery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Ward, believe me that I regret deeply that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been unable to solve the problem you entrusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense! Do not upset yourself, Strock. Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">your defeat philosophically. We cannot always be</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful, even in the police. How many criminals</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape us! I believe we should never capture one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, if they were a little more intelligent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">less imprudent, and if they did not compromise them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves so stupidly. Nothing, it seems to me, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be easier than to plan a crime, a theft or an assassi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation, and to execute it without arousing any sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picions, or leaving any traces to be followed. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, Strock, I do not want to give our crimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nals lessons; I much prefer to have them remain as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are. Nevertheless there are many whom the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police will never be able to track down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On this matter I shared absolutely the opinion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chief. It is among rascals that one finds the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most fools. For this very reason I had been much</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised that none of the authorities had been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to throw' any light upon the recent performances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "demon automobile." And when Mr. Ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up this subject, I did not conceal from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">my astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed out that the vehicle was practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpursuable; that in its earlier appearances, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently vanished from all roads even before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone message could be sent ahead. Active and</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous police agents had been spread throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country, but no one of them had encountered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delinquent. He did not move continuously from</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to place, even at his amazing speed, but seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appear only for a moment and then to vanish into</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin air. True, he had at length remained visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the entire route from Prairie du Chien to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milwaukee, and he had covered in less than an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half this track of two hundred miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But since then, there had been no news whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine. Arrived at the end of the route,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven onward by its own impetus, unable to stop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it indeed been engulfed within the water of Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michigan? Must we conclude that the machine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its driver had both perished, that there was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">any danger to be feared from either? The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority of the public refused to accept this con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion." They fully expected the machine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Ward frankly admitted that the whole matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him most extraordinary; and I shared his</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. Assuredly if this infernal chauffeur did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">return, his apparition would have to be placed among</seg><seg type="columnLine">those superhuman mysteries which it is not given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had fully discussed this affair, the chief and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I; and I thought that our interview was at an end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, after pacing the room for a few moments, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said abruptly, "Yes, what happened there at Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waukee was very strange. But here is something</seg><seg type="columnLine">no less so!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this he handed me a report which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">received from Boston, on a subject of which the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning papers had just begun to apprise their readers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">While I read it, Mr. Ward was summoned from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. I seated myself by the window and studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with extreme attention the matter of the report.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some days the waters along the coast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maine, Massachusetts and Connecticut had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of an appearance which no one could exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe. A moving body would appear amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters, some two or three miles off shore, and go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through rapid evolutions. It would flash for a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth among the waves and then dart out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The body moved with such lightning speed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best telescopes could hardly follow it. Its length</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to exceed thirty feet. Its cigar-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and greenish color, made it difficult to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguish against the background of the ocean. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been most frequently observed along the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Cape Cod and Nova Scotia. From Provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, from Boston, from Portsmouth, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portland motor boats and steam launches had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly attempted to approach this moving body</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even to give it chase. They could not get any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where near it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pursuit seemed useless. It darted like an arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the range of view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Naturally, widely differing opinions were held as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the nature of this object. But no hypothesis</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on any secure basis. Seamen were as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a loss as others. At first sailors thought it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be some great fish, like a whale. But it is well</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that all these animals come to the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a certain regularity to breathe, and spout up</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns of mingled air and water. Now, this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal, if it was an animal, had never "blown" as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whalers say; nor, had it ever made any noises</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breathing. Yet if it were not one of these huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine mammals, how was this unknown monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be classed? Did it belong among the legendary</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellers in the deep, the krakens, the octopuses, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leviathans, the famous sea-serpents?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At any rate, since this monster, whatever it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared along the New England shores, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fishing-smacks and pleasure boats dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture forth. Wherever it appeared.the boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled to the nearest harbor, as was but prudent. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animal was of a ferocious character, none cared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to await its attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As to the large ships and coast steamers, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to fear from any monster, whale or other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. Several of them had seen this creature at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of some miles. But when they attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to approach, it fled rapidly4 away. One day, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fast United States gun boat went out from Boston,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not to pursue the monster, at least to send after</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a few cannon shot. Almost instantly the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared, and the attempt was vain. As yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, the monster had shown no intention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacking either boats or people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment Mr. Ward returned and I inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted my reading to say, "There seems as yet no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to complain of this sea-serpent. It flees</seg><seg type="columnLine">before big ships. It does not pursue little ones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feeling and intelligence are not very strong in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yet their emotions' exist, Strock, and if strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused-•"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But. Mr. Ward, the beast seems not at all dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous. One of two things will happen. Either it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will presently quit these coasts, or finally it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">1038</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">captured and we shall be able to study it at our leisure</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in the museum of Washington."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''And if it is not a marine animal?" asked Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What else can it be?" I protested in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Finish your reading," said Mr. Ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I did so; and found that in the second part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">report, my chief had underlined some passages in</seg><seg type="columnLine">red pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For some time no one had doubted that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an animal; and that, i f it were vigorously pursued, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would at last be driven from our shores. But a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of opinion had come about. People began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask if, instead of a fish, this were not some new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remarkable kind of boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Certainly in that case its engine must be one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing power. Perhaps the inventor befor^ selling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of his invention, sought to attract public</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention and to astound the maritime world. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">surety in the movements of his boat, grace in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">every evolution, such ease in defying pursuit by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow-like speed, surely, these were enough to arouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">world-wide curiosity!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At that time great progress had been made in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacture of marine engines. Huge transatlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamers completed the ocean passage in five days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the engineers had not yet spoken their last word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither were the navies of the world behindhand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cruisers, the torpedo boats, the torpedo-destroy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, could match the swiftest steamers of the Atlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pacific, or of the Indian trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If, however, this were a boat of some new design,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had as yet been no opportunity to observe its</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. As to the engines which drove it, they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. of a power far beyond the most efficient known.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By what force they worked, was equally a problem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since the boat had no sails, it was not driven by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind; and since it had no smoke-stack, it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven by steam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At- this point in the report, I again paused in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading and considered the comment I wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What are you puzzling over, Strock?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is this, Mr. Ward; the motive power of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called boat must be as tremendous and as un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as that of the remarkable automobile which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has so amazed us all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So that is your idea, is it, Strock?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Mr. Ward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was but one conclusion to be drawn. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious chauffeur had disappeared, if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">perished with his machine in Lake Michigan, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally important now to win the secret of this no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less mysterious navigator. And it must be won</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he in his turn plunged into the abyss of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean. Was it not the interest of the inventor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclose his invention? Would not the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">government or any other give him any price he chose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet unfortunately, since the inventor of the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial apparition had persisted in preserving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">incognito, was it not to be feared that the inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the marine apparition would equally preserve his?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if the first machine still existed, it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer heard from; and would not the second, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way, after having disclosed its powers, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear in its turn, without a single trace?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What gaye weight to this probability was, that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">since the arrival of this report at Washington twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours before, the presence of the extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat had not been announced from anywhere along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore. Neither had it been seen on any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast. Though, of course, the assertion that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not reappear at all, would have been hazard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, to say the least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I noted another interesting and possibly impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant point. It was a singular coincidence which in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed Mr. Ward suggested to me, at the same moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was considering it. This was that only after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disappearance of the wonderful automobile had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the no less wonderful boat come into view. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, their engines both possessed a most dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of locomotion. If both should go rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time over the face of the world, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same danger would threaten mankind everywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in boats, in vehicles, and on foot. Therefore it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely necessary that the police should in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner interfere to protect the public ways of travel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That is what Mr. Ward pointed out to me; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our duty was obvious. But how could we accomplish</seg><seg type="columnLine">this task? _We discussed the matter for some time;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was just about to leave when Mr. Ward made</seg><seg type="columnLine">one last suggestion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Have you not observed, Strock," said he, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a sort of fantastic resemblance between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the general appearance of this boat and this auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There is. something of the sort, Mr. Ward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, is it not possible that the two are one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         The First Letter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER leaving Mr. Ward I returned to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">home in Long Street. There I had plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">. of time to consider this strange case unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted by either wife or children. My household</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted solely of an ancient servant, who having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been formerly in the service of my mother, had now</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued for fifteen years in mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Two months before I had obtained a leave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence. It had still two weeks to run, unless indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some unforeseen circumstance interrupted it, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission which could not be delayed. This leave, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have shown, had already been interrupted for four</seg><seg type="columnLine">days by my exploration of the Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. And now was it not my duty to abandon my vaca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and endeavor to throw light upon the remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able events of which the road to Milwaukee and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore of New England had been in turn the scene?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have given much to solve the twin mysteries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but how was it possible'to follow the track of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile or this boat?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ Seated in my easy chair after breakfast, with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe lighted, I opened my newspaper. To what</seg><seg type="columnLine">should I turn? Politics interested me but little, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its eternal strife between the Republicans and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Democrats. Neither did I care for the news of</seg><seg type="columnLine">society, nor for the sporting page. You will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised, then, that my first idea was to see if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was any news from North Carolina about the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyrie. There was little hope of this, however, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Smith had promised to telegraph me at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">if anything occurred. I felt quite sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayor of Morganton was as eager for information</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as watchful as I could have been myself. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER OF THE WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">paper told me nothing- new. It dropped idly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand; and I remained deep in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What most frequently recurred to me was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of Mr. Ward that perhaps the automo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bile and the boat which had attracted our attention</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were in reality one and the same. Very probably,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at least, the two machines had been built by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same hand. And beyond doubt, these were similar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engines, which generated this remarkable speed, more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than doubling the previous records of earth and sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The same inventor!" repeated I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Evidently this hypothesis had strong grounds. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fact that the two machines had not yet appeared at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the same time added weight to the idea. I mur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mured to myself, "After the mystery of Great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Eyrie, comes that of Milwaukee and Boston. Will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this new problem be as difficult to solve afc was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other?"	\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I noted idly that this new affair had a general</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resemblance to the other, since both menaced the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">security of the general public. To be sure, only the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants of the Blue Ridge region had been in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">danger from an eruption or possible earthquake at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Great Eyrie. While now, on every road of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">United States, or along every league of its coasts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and harbors, every inhabitant was in danger from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this vehicle or this boat, with its sudden appearance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and insane speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I found that, as was to be expected, the news-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">papers not only suggested, but enlarged upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dangers of the case. Timid people everywhere were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much alarmed. My old servant, naturally credulous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and superstitious, was particularly upset. That same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day after dinner, as she was clearing away the things,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she stopped before me, a water bottle in one hand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the napkin in the other, and asked anxiously, "Is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there no news, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "None," I answered, knowing well to what she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">referred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The automobile has not come back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Nor the boat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Nor the boat.

When that happens, there will be some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chance of catching him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He will never be arrested, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Because he is the devil himself, and you can't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arrest the devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Decidedly, thought I, the devil has many uses;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and if he did not exist we would have to invent him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to give people some way of explaining the inexplic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able. It was he who lit the flames of the Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was he who smashed the record in the Wisconsin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">race. It is he who is scurrying along the shores</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Connecticut and Massachusetts. But putting tc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one side this evil spirit, who is so necessary for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">convenience of the ignorant, there was no doubt that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1039</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we were facing a most bewildering problem. Had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">both of these machines disappeared forever? They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had passed like a meteor, like a star shooting through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space; and in a hundred years the adventure would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">become a legend, much to the taste of the gossips of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the next century.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For several days the newspapers of America and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even those of Europe continued to discuss these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">events. Editorials crowded upon editorials. Rumors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were added to rumors. Story tellers of every kind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowded to the front. The public of two continents</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was interested. In some parts of Europe there was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even jealousy that America should have been chosen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as the field of such an experience. If these marvelous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inventors were American, then their country, their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">army and navy, would have a great advantage over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">others. The United States might acquire an incon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">testible superiority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Under the date of the tenth of June, a New York</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paper published a carefully studied article on this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phase of the subject. Comparing the speed of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swiftest known vessels with the "smallest minimum</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of speed which could possibly be assigned to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">new boat, the article demonstrated that if the United</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">States secured this secret, Europe would be but three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days away from her, while she would still be five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days from Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   If our own police had searched diligently to dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cover the mystery of the Great Eyrie, the secret serv-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ice of every country in the world was now interested</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in these new problems.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Ward referred to the matter each time I saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. Our chat would begin by his rallying me about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my ill-success in Carolina, and I would respond by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reminding him that success there was only a ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of expense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Never mind, my good Strock," said he, "there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will come a chance for our clever inspector to regain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his laurels.

I looked at the address. I did not know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the handwriting.

"Ohs!" and "Ahs!" slipped from my open</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mouth.

Reflection inclined me yet more strongly to be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lieve that it was the work of a practical joker. My</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">adventure was well known. The newspapers had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">given it in full detail. Some satirist, such as exists</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even in America, must have written this threatening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">letter to mock me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    To assume, on the other hand, that the Eyrie really</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">served as the refuge of a band of criminals, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">absurd. If they feared that the police would dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover their retreat, surely they would not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so foolish as thus to force attention upon themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their chief security would lie in keeping their pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence there unknown. They must have realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a challenge from them would only arouse the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police to renewed activity. Dynamite or melinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon open an entrance to their fortress. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, how could these men have, themselves, gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance into the Eyrie--unless there existed a pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage which we had failed to discover? Assuredly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter came from a jester or a madman; and I need</seg><seg type="columnLine">not worry over it, nor even consider it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hence, though for an instant I had thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing this letter to Mr. Ward, I decided not to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. Surely he would attach no importance to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I did not destroy it, but locked it in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk for safekeeping. If more letters came of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same kind, and with the same initials, I would attach</seg><seg type="columnLine">as little weight to them as to this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Several, days passed quietly. There was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lead me to expect that I would soon quit Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington ; though in my line of duty one is never cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of the morrow. At any moment I might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding from Oregon to Florida, from Maine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas. And--this unpleasant thought haunted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently--if my next mission were no more suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful than that to the Great Eyrie, I might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">give up and hand in my resignation from the force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of the mysterious chauffeur or chauffeurs, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more was heard. I knew that our own government</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents, as well as foreign ones, were keeping keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch over all the roads and rivers, all the lakes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coasts of America. Of course, the size of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country made any close supervision impossible; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">these twin inventors had not before chosen secluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unfrequented spots in which to appear. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">main highway of Wisconsin on a great race day, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harbor of Boston, incessantly crossed by thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of boats, these were hardly what would be called hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing places! If the daring driver had not perished--</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which there was always strong probability; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must have left America. Perhaps he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the Old World, or else resting in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat known only to himself, and in that case--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ah!" I repeated to myself, many times, "for such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a retreat, as secret as inaccessible, this fantastic per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonage could not find one better than the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyrie!" But, of course, a boat could not get there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more than an automobile. Only high-flying birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of prey, eagles or condors, could find refuge there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The nineteenth of June I was going to the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">bureau, when, on leaving my house, I noticed two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who looked at me with a certain keenness. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing them, I took no notice; and if my attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">was drawn to the matter, it was because my servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of it when I returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For some days, she said, she had noticed that two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men seemed to be spying upon me in the street. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood constantly, perhaps a hundred steps from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">house; and she suspected that they followed me each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I Avent up the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You are sure?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, sir, and no longer ago than yesterday, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you came into the house, these men came slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">along in your footsteps, and then went away as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the door was shut behind you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You must be mistaken?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER OF THE WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1041</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But I tell you I am not mistaken, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And if you met these two men, you would know</seg><seg type="columnLine">them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I would."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good," I cried, laughing, "I see you have the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of a detective.

But I have still two good</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and I don't need spectacles to recognize people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Someone is spying on you, that's certain; and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should put some of your men to track them, in turn."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right; I promise to do so," I said, to satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "And when my men get after them, we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon know what these mysterious fellows want of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In truth, I did not take the good soul's excited an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncement very seriously.

"If I see them again," she added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I will warn you before you set foot out of doors."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Agreed!" And I broke off the conversation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing well that if I allowed her to run on, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would end by being sure that Beelzebub himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his chief attendants were at my heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The two following days, there was certainly no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one spying on me, either at my exits or entrances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I concluded that my old servant had made much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nothing, as usual. But on the morning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-second of June, after rushing upstairs as</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly as her age would permit, the devoted old soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst into my room and in a half whisper gasped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sir!

I queried, my mind on anything but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">web she had been spinning about me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The two spies!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ah, those wonderful spies!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Themselves !--In the street!--Right in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our windows!--Watching the house, waiting for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I went to the window and raising just an edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shade, so as not to give any warning, I saw two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on the pavement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were rather fine-looking men, broad-shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered and vigorous, aged somewhat under forty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in the ordinary fashion of the day, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">slouched hats, heavy woolen suits, stout walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes and sticks in hand. Undoubtedly, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring persistently at my apparently unwatchful</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Then, having exchanged a few words, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled off a little way, and returned again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Are you sure these are the same men you saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Evidently, I could no longer dismiss her warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an hallucination; and I promised myself to clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the matter. As to following the men myself, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was presumably too well known to them. To address</seg><seg type="columnLine">them directly would probably be of no use. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that very day, one of our best men should be put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on watch, and if the spies returned on the morrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should be tracked in their turn, and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">until their identity was established.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the moment, they were waiting to follow me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to police headquarters. For it was there that I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bound, as usual. If they accompanied me I might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to offer them a hospitality for which they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce thank me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took my hat; and while the housekeeper re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained peeping from the window, I went down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs, opened the door, and stepped into the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men were no longer there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite all my watchfulness, that day I saw no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of them a's I passed along the streets. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time on, indeed, neither my old servant nor I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them again before the house, nor did I encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter them elsewhere. Their appearance, however, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped upon my memory, I would not forget them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps, after all, admitting that I had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of their espionage, they had been mistaken in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my identity. Having obtained a good look at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they now followed me no more. So in the end, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to regard this matter as of no more importance</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the letter with the initials M. o. W.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, on the twenty-fourth of June, there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new event, to further stimulate both my interest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the general public in the previous mysteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the automobile and the boat. The Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evening Star published the following account, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was next morning copied by every paper in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lake Kirdall in Kansas, forty miles west of To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peka, is little known. It deserves wider knowledge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and doubtless will have it hereafter, for attention is</seg><seg type="columnLine">now drawn to it in a very remarkable way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This lake, dee]) among the mountains, appears to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no outlet. What it loses in evaporation, it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gains from the little neighboring streamlets and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy rains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lake Kirdall covers about seventy-five square</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, and its level is but slightly below that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights which surround it. Shut in among the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, it can be reached only by narrow and rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorges. Several villages, however, have sprung up</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its banks. It is full of fish, and fishing-boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover its waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lake Kirdall is in many places fifty feet deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to shore. Sharp, pointed rocks form the edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this huge basin. Its surges, roused by high-winds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat upon its banks with fury, and the houses near</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand are often deluged with spray as if with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">downpour of a hurricane. The lake, already deep at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge, becomes yet deeper toward the center,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in some places soundings show over three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fishing industry supports a population of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several thousands, and there are several hundred fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing boats in addition to the dozen or so of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamers which serve the traffic of the lake. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle of the mountains lie the railroads which</seg><seg type="columnLine">transport the products of the fishing industry</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout Kansas and the neighboring states.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This account of Lake Kirdall is necessary for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding of the remarkable facts which we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to report."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this is what the Evening Star then reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its startling article. "For some time past, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishermen have noticed a strange upheaval in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the lake. Sometimes it rises as if a wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged up from its depths. Even in perfectly calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather, when there is no wind whatever, this up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaval sometimes arises in a mass of foam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tossed about by violent waves of unaccountable</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents/ boats have been swept beyond all control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1042</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes they have been dashed one against an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and serious damage has resulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This confusion of the waters evidently has its</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin somewhere in the depths of the lake; and vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous explanations have been offered to account for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first, it was suggested that the trouble was due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seismic forces, to some volcanic action beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fake; but this hypothesis had to be rejected when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was recognized that the disturbance was not confined</seg><seg type="columnLine">lo one locality, but spread itself over the entire sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the lake, either at one part or another, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center or along the edges, traveling along almost in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular line and in a way to exclude entirely all idea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earthquake or volcanic action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">; "Another hypothesis suggested that it was a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rine monster who thus upheaved the waters.

Lake Kirdall, however, has no con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection with any other waters. If this lake were</seg><seg type="columnLine">situated near any of the oceans, there might be sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terranean canals; but in the center of America, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the height of some thousands of feet above sca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jevel, this is not possible. In short, here is another</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddle not easy to solve, and it is much easier to point</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the impossibility of false explanations, than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover the true ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is it possible that the submarine boat is being</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimented with beneath the lake? Such boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no longer impossible today. Some years ago, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridgeport, Connecticut, there was launched a boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Protector, which could go on the water, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, and also upon land. Built by an inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Lake, supplied with two motors, an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of seventy-five horsepower, and a gasoline one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two hundred and fifty horsepower, it was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided with wheels a yard in diameter, which en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abled it to roll over the roads, as well as swim the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But even then, granting that the turmoil of Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirdall might be produced by a submarine, brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a high degree of perfection, there remains as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the question how could it have reached Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirdall ? The lake, shut in on all sides by a circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, is no more accessible to a submarine than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sea-monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In whatever way this last puzzling question may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be solved, the nature of this strange appearance can</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer be disputed since the twentieth of June.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On that day, in the afternoon, the schooner Market,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while speeding with all sails set, came into violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision with something just below the water level.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no shoal nor rock near; for the lake in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this part is eighty or ninety feet deep. The schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both her bow and her side badly broken, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great danger of sinking. She managed, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the shore before her decks were completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">submerged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the Mark el had been pumped out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled up on shore, an examination showed that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had received a blow near the bow, as if from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful ram.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "From this it seems evident that there is actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">a submarine boat which darts about beneath the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of Lake Kirdall with most remarkable rapidity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The thing is difficult to explain. Not only is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a question as to how did the submarine get</seg><seg type="columnLine">there? But why is it there? Why does it never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the surface? What reason has its owner for</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining unknown? Are other disasters to be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected from its reckless course?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The article in the Evening Star closed with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly striking suggestion: "After the mysterious au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomobile, came the mysterious boat. Now comes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious submarine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Must we conclude that the three engines are due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the genius of the same inventor, and that the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicles are in truth but one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          CHAPTER VTII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          At Any Cost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE suggestion of the Star came like a revela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It was accepted everywhere. Not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">were these three vehicles the work of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor; they were the same machine!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was not easy to see how the remarkable trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation could be practically accomplished from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one means of locomotion to the other. How could</seg><seg type="columnLine">an automobile become a boat, and yet more, a suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine? All the machine seemed to lack was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of flying through the air. Nevertheless, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that was known of the three different machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to their size, their shape, their lack of odor or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, and above all, their remarkable speed, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to imply their identity. The public, grown blase with</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many excitements, found in this new marvel a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulus to reawaken their curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newspapers dwelt now chiefly on the impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of the invention. This new engine, whether in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one vehicle or three, had given proofs of its power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What amazing proofs! The invention must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought at any-price. The United States government</seg><seg type="columnLine">must purchase it at once for the use of the nation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assuredly, the great European powers would stop at</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to be beforehand with America, and gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of an engine so invaluable for military</seg><seg type="columnLine">and naval use. What incalculable advantages would</seg><seg type="columnLine">it give to any nation, both on land and sea! Its de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive powers could not even be estimated, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">its qualities and limitations were better known. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of money would be too great ta pay for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret; America could not put her millions to better</seg><seg type="columnLine">use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But to buy the machine, it was necessary to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inventor; and there the chief difficulty seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. In vain was Lake Kirdall searched from end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. Even its depths were explored with a sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-line without results. Must it be concluded that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the submarine no longer lurked beneath its waters?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in that case, how had the boat gotten away? For</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matter, how had it come? An insoluble</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The submarine was heard from no more, neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Lake Kirdall nor elsewhere. It had disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the automobile from the roads, and like the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shores of America. Several times in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">interviews with Mr. Ward, we discussed this matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which still filled his mind. Our men continued every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where on the lookout, but as unsuccessfully as other</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the morning of the twenty-seventh of June, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was summoned into the presence of Mr. Ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, Strock," said he, "here is a splendid chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to get your revenge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Revenge for the Great Eyrie disappointment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER OF THE WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1043</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What chance?" asked I, not knowing if he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously, or in jest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, here/' he answered. "Would not you like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover the inventor of this three-fold machine?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I certainly should, Mr. Ward. Give me the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take charge of the matter, and I will accomplish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impossible, in order to succeed. It is true, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve it will be difficult."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Undoubtedly, Strock. Perhaps even more diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult than to penetrate into the Great Eyrie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was evident that Mr. Ward was intent on rally-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me about my unsuccess. He would not do that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt assured, out of mere unkindness. Perhaps then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he meant to rouse my resolution. He knew me well;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and realized that I would have given anything in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to recoup my defeat. I waited quietly for new</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions.	v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Ward dropped his jesting and said to me very</seg><seg type="columnLine">generously, "I know, Strock, that you accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that depended on human powers; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no blame attaches to you. But we face now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter very different from that of the Great Eyrie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The day the government decides to force that sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ret, everything is ready. We have only to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">some thousands of dollars, and the road will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">open."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is what I would urge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But at present," said Mr. Ward, shaking his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it is much more important to place our hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fantastic inventor, who so constantly escapes us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is work for a detective, indeed; a master de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has not been heard from again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; and though there is every reason to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he has been, and still continues, beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of Lake Kirdall, it has been impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find any trace of him anywhere around there. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">would almost fancy he had the power of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself invisible, this Proteus of a mechanic!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems likely," said I, "that he will never be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen until he wishes to be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, Strock. And to my mind there is only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of dealing with him, and that is to offer him</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an enormous price that he cannot refuse to sell</seg><seg type="columnLine">his invention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Ward was right. Indeed, the government had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already made the effort to secure speech with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero of the day, and surely no human being has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">better merited the title. The press had widely spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news, and this extraordinary individual must as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suredly know what the government desired of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how completely he could name the terms he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely," added Mr. Ward, "this invention can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no personal use to the man, that he should hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from the rest of us. There is every reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should sell it. Can this unknown be already some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous criminal who, thanks to his machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes to defy all pursuit?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My chief then went on to explain that it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to employ other means jn search of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor. It was possible, after all, that he had per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished with his machine in some dangerous maneuver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If so, the ruined vehicle might prove almost as valu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able and instructive to the mechanical world as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man himself. But since the accident to the schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markel on Lake Kirdall, no news of him whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On this point, Mr. Ward did not attempt to hide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his disappointment and his anxiety. Anxiety, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was manifestly becoming more and more diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult for him to fulfill his duty of protecting the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic. How could we arrest criminals, if they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">flee from justice at such speed over both land and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea? How could we pursue them under the oceans?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when dirigible balloons should also have reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">their full perfection, we would even have to chase</seg><seg type="columnLine">men through the air! I asked myself if my col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues and I would not find ourselves some day re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced to utter helplessness? if police officials, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a useless incumbrance, would be definitely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carded by society ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here, there recurred to me the jesting letter I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">received a fortnight before, the letter which threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened my liberty and even my life. I recalled, also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the singular espionage of which I had been the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject. I asked myself if I had better mention these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to Mr. Ward. But they seemed to have abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely no relation to the matter now in hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Eyrie affair had been definitely put aside by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government, since an eruption was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening. And they now wished to employ me</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon this newer matter. I waited, then, to mention</seg><seg type="columnLine">this letter to my chief at some future time, when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be not so sore a joke to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Ward again took up our conversation. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are resolved by some means to establish communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation with this inventor. He has disappeared, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true; but he may reappear at any moment, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any part of the country. I have chosen you, Strock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow him the instant he appears. You must hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself ready to leave Washington on the moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do not quit your house, except to come here to head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters each day; notify me, each time by tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone, when you start from home, and report to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">personally the moment you arrive here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will follow orders exactly, Mr. Ward," I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "But permit me one question. Ought I to</seg><seg type="columnLine">act alone, or will it not be better to join with me--?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is what I intend," said the chief, interrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me. "You are to choose two of our men whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think the best fitted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will do so, Mr. Ward.

I could not have had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several days passed, without news, either of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile, the boat, or the submarine. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumors in plenty; but the police knew them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">false. As to the reckless stories that appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newspapers, they had most of them, no founda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion whatever.

The first asserted that he had been seen on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads of Arkansas, near Little Rock. The second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was in the very middle of Lake Superior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unfortunately, these two notices were absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreconcilable; for while the first gave the afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of June twenty-sixth, as the time of appearance, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second set it for the evening of the same day. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two points of the United States territory are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not less than eight hundred miles apart. Even grant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the automobile this unthinkable speed, greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any it had yet shown, how could it have crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the intervening country unseen? How could it</seg><seg type="columnLine">traverse the States of Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wisconsin, from end to end, without any one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents giving us warning, without any interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">person rushing to a telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After these two momentary appearances, if ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearances they were, the machine again dropped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of knowledge.

The following</seg><seg type="columnLine">official notice was published in every newspaper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States, under July 3d. It was couched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most formal terms:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "During the month of April, of the present year,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an automobile traversed the roads of Pennsylvania,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kentucky, of Ohio, of Tennessee, of Missouri, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Illinois; and, on the twenty-seventh of May, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the race held by the American Automobile Club, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the course in Wisconsin.

Then it disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the second fortnight of the same month, a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine boat was run beneath the waters of Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirdall, in Kansas. Then it disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything points to the belief that the same in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor must have built these three machines, or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps that they are the same machine, constructed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to travel both on land and water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A proposition is therefore addressed to the said</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor, whoever he be, with the aim of acquiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the said machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is requested to make himself known and to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">name the terms upon which he will treat with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States government. He is also requested to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer as promptly as possible to the Department of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Federal Police, Washington, D. C., United States of</seg><seg type="columnLine">America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the notice printed in large type on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front page of every newspaper. Surely it could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail to reach the eye of him for whom it was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended, wherever he might be. He would read it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could scarce fail to answer it in some manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And why should he refuse such an unlimited offer?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had only to await his reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One can easily imagine how high the public curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity rose. From morning till night, an eager and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy crowd pressed about the bureau of police,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting the arrival of a letter or a telegram. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">best reporters were on the spot. What honor, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit would come to the paper which was first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">publish the famous news! To know at last the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">and place of the undiscoverable unknown! And to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know if he would agree to some bargain with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government! It goes without saying that America</seg><seg type="columnLine">does things on a magnificent scale. Millions would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be lacking for the inventor. If necessary, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the millionaires in the country would open their in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustible purses!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day passed. To how many excited and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient people it seemed to contain more than twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours! And each hour held far more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty minutes! There came no answer, no letter, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegram! The night following, there was still no</seg><seg type="columnLine">news. And it was the same the next day--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came, however, another result, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fully foreseen. The cables informed Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what the United States government had done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The different Powers of the Old World hoped also</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtain possession of the wonderful invention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why should they not struggle for an advantage so</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous? Why should they not enter the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test with their millions ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In brief, every great power took part in the affair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">France, England, Russia, Italy, Austria, Germany.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the states of the second order refrained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering with their smaller resources, upon a useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. The European press published notices identi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal with that of the United States. The extraordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary "chauffeur" had only to speak, to become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival to the Vanderbilts, the Astors, the Goulds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morgans, and the Rothschilds of every country of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, when the mysterious inventor made no sign,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what attractive* offers were held forth to tempt him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discard the secrecy in which he was enwrapped!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole world became a public market, an auction</seg><seg type="columnLine">house whence arose the most amazing bids. Twice a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day the newspapers would add up the amounts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">these kept rising from millions to millions. The end</seg><seg type="columnLine">came when the United States Congress, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">memorable session, voted to offer the sum of twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">million dollars. And there was not a citizen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">States of whatever rank, who objected to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount, so much importance was attached to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of this prodigious engine of locomotion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As for me, I said emphatically to my old house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper : "The machine is worth even more than that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently the other nations of the world did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think so, for their bids remained below the final sum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how useless was this mighty struggle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER OF THE WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1045</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great rivals! The inventor did not appear! He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exist! He had never existed! It was all a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous pretense of the American newspapers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, at least, became the announced view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old World.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And so the time passed. There was no further</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of our man, there was no response from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He appeared no more. For my part, not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to think, I commenced to lose all hope of reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing any solution to the strange affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then on the morning of the fifteenth of July, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter without postmark was found in the mailbox</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the police bureau. After the authorities had</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied it, it was given out to the Washington jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nals, which published it in facsimile, in special num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers.

From</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset to sunrise, there had always been people busy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious, or curious, passing before our door. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, however, that even then, the bearer of the let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter might easily have slipped by unseen and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter in the box. The night had been so dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could scarcely see from one side of the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I have said that this letter appeared in facsimile in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	all the newspapers to which the government com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municated it. Perhaps one would naturally imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the first comment of the public would be, "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the work of some practical joker." It was in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that I had accepted my letter from the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyrie, five weeks before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But this was not the general attitude toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present letter, neither in Washington, nor in the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of America. To the few who would have maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the document should not be taken seriously, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense majority would have responded: "This let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter has not the style nor the spirit of a jester. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man could have written it; and that is the inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor of this unapproachable machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To most people this conclusion seemed indisput-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, owing to a curious state of mind easily explain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. For all the strange facts of which the key had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitherto been lacking, this letter furnished an expla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation. The theory now almost universally accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as follows: The inventor had hidden himself for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, only in order to reappear more startlingly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some new light. Instead of having perished in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident, he had concealed himself in some retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the police were unable to discover him. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assert positively his attitude toward all govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments he had written this letter. But instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping it in the post in any one locality, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have resulted in its being traced to him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to Washington and deposited it himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very spot suggested by the government's official</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice, the Bureau of Police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Well! If this remarkable personage had reckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this new proof of his existence would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">some noise in two worlds, he certainly figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightly. That day, the millions of good folk who</seg><seg type="columnLine">read and re-read their daily paper could--to employ</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well-known phrase--scarcely believe their eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As for myself, I studied carefully every phase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defiant document. The handwriting was black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heavy. An expert at chirography would doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less have distinguished in the lines traces of a violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperament, of a character stern and unsocial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, a cry escaped me--a cry that fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">my housekeeper did not hear. Why had I not no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed sooner the resemblance of the handwriting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lhat of the letter I had received from Morganton?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Moreover, a yet more significant coincidence, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">initials with which my letter had been signed, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">they not stand for the words "Master of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And whence came the second letter? "On Board</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'Terror.' " Doubtless this name was that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triple machine commanded by the mysterious cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. The initials in my letter were his own signa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture; and it was he who had threatened me, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared to renew my attempt on the Great Eyrie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I rose and took from my desk the letter of June</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirteenth.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were both in the same peculiar handwriting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My mind worked eagerly. I sought to trace the</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable deductions from this striking fact, known</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to myself.

I asked myself if our</seg><seg type="columnLine">search could not now be prosecuted under less vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions.

Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Mr. Ward himself dwell upon the extravagant</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypothesis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the two letters and compared them</seg><seg type="columnLine">afresh. He examined them under a microscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially the signatures, and established their per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect identity. Not only the same hand, but the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen had written them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After some moments of further reflection, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ward said, "I will keep your letter, Strock. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidedly, I think, that you are fated to play an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant part in this strange affair--or rather in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two affairs.

It was felt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both at the White House and at the Capitol, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">public opinion absolutely demanded some action. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, it was difficult to do anything. Where could</seg><seg type="columnLine">one find this Master of the World? And even if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were discovered, how could he be captured? He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his disposal not only the powers he had displayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but apparently still greater resources as yet unknown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How had he been able to reach Lake Kirdall over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks; and how had he escaped from it? Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had indeed appeared on Lake Superior, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he covered all the intervening territory unseen ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a bewildering affair it was altogether! This,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, made it all the more important to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of it. Since the millions of dollars had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been refused, force must be employed.- The inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his invention were not to be bought. And in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what haughty and menacing terms he had couched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his refusal! So lie it! He must be treated as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy of society, against whom all means became</seg><seg type="columnLine">justified, that he might be deprived of his power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">injure others. The idea that he had perished was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now entirely discarded. He was alive, very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive; and his existence constituted a perpetual pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic danger!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Influenced by these ideas, the government issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following proclamation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since the commander of the 'Terror' has refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make public his invention, at any price whatever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the use which he makes of his machine con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitutes a public menace, against which it is impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to guard, the said commander of the 'Terror' is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hereby placed beyond the protection of the law.

All was left to the hazard of fortune. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the outlaw re-appeared he would be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and signaled, and when the chance came he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrested. This could not be accomplished when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his automobile on land or in his boat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.

But the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not arrive, for the very good reason that the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom it concerned remained undiscovered. The lend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of July approached. The newspapers continued 'the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. They published repeated rumors. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">clues were constantly being announced. But all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mere idle talk.

The enormous rewards</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">offered could not help but lead to accusations, errors,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and blunders, made, many of them, in good faith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One time it would be a cloud of dust, which must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have contained the automobile.

No one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">realized the tremendous depth of the chasm between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the two groups of the Genus Homo till the national</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">law was passed forbidding the use of all highways to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pedestrians. At once, all over the United States,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the revolt of the Walkers began. Although Bunker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hill was hundreds of years away, the spirit of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bunker Hill survived, and the prohibition of walking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the roads only increased the desire to do so. More</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pedestrians than ever were accidentally killed. Their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">families retaliated by using every effort to make auto-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mobiling unpleasant and dangerous--nails, tacks,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glass, logs, barbed wire, huge rocks were used as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weapons. In the Ozarks, backwoodsmen took de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light in breaking windshields and puncturing tires</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with well-directed rifle shots. Others walked the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">roads and defied the automobilists. Had the odds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been equal, a condition of anarchy would have re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sulted, being unequal, the pedestrians were simply a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nuisance. Class-consciousness reached its acme when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Senator Glass of New York rose in the Senate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Chambers and said in part:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A race that ceases to develop must die out. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">centuries mankind has been on wheels, and thus has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">advanced towards a state of mechanical perfection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The pedestrian, careless of his inherent right to ride,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has persisted not only in walking, but even has gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so far as to claim equal rights with the higher type</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of automobilists. Patience has ceased to be a virtue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nothing more can be done for these miserable de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">generates of our race. The kindest thing to do now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is to inaugurate a process of extermination. Only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thus can we prevent a continuation of the disorders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which have marked the otherwise uniform peaceful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">history of our fair land. There is, therefore, nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for me to do save to urge the passage of the 'Pedes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trian Extermination Act.' This as you know pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vides for the instant death of all pedestrians where-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever and whenever they are found by the Constabu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lary of each State. The last census shows there are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only about ten thousand left and these are mostly in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a few of the mid-western states. I am proud to state</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that my own constituency, which up to yesterday had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only one pedestrian, an old man over 90 years of age,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has now a clear record. A telegram just received</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">states that fortunately he tottered on a public road</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a senile effort to visit his wife's grave and was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instantly killed by an automobilist. But though New</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'tork has at present none of these vile degenerates,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we are anxious to aid our less fortunate states."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 he law was instantly passed, being opposed only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the Senators from Kentucky, Tennessee and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Arkansas. I o promote interest, a bounty was placed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on each pedestrian killed. A silver star was given to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each county reporting complete success. A gold star</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to each state containing only autoists. The pedes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trian, like the carrier pigeon, was doomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I T is not to be expected that the extermination was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">immediate or complete. There was some unex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pected resistance. It had been in effect one year</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the pedestrian child swore vengeance on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mechanical means of destroying humanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sunday afternoon a hundred years later, the Acad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">emy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia was filled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the usual throng of pleasure seekers, each in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his own auto-car. Noiselessly, on rubber-tired</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wheels, they journeyed down the long aisles, pausing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now and then before this exhibit or that which at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tracted their individual attention. A father was tak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing his little boy through and each was greatly in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terested: the boy in the new world of wonders, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">father in the boy's intelligent questions and observa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions. Finally the boy stopped his auto-car in front</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a glass case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "W hat is that, Father ? They look as we do, only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what peculiar shapes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That, my son, is a family of pedestrians. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long ago it all happened and I know of it only be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause my mother told me about them. This family</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was shot in the Ozark Mountains. It is believed they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were the last in the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am sorry," said the boy, slowly. "If there were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more, I would like you to get a little one for me to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">play with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There are no more," said the father. "They are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The man thought he was telling the truth to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son. In fact, he prided himself on always being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">truthful to children. Yet he was wrong. For a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pedestrians remained, and their leader, in fact, their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very brains, was the great-grandson of the little boy,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who had stood up on the hill with hatred in his heart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Irrespective of climatic conditions, environment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and all varieties of enemies, man has always been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able to exist. With the race of Pedestrians it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in very truth the survival of the fittest. Only the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most agile, intelligent and sturdy were able to sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vive the systematic attempt made to exterminate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them. Though reduced in numbers they survived;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though deprived of all the so-called benefits of mod-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ern civilization, they existed. Forced to defend not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only their individual existence, but also the very life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of their race, they gained the cunning of their back-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woodsmen ancestors and kept alive. They lived,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hunted, loved, and died and for two generations the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE REVOLT OF THE PEDESTRIANS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1051</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">civilized world was unaware of their very existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They had their political organization, their courts of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">law. Justice, based on Blackstone and the Constitu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, ruled. Always a Miller ruled: first the little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boy with hatred in his heart, grown to manhood;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then his son, trained from childhood to the sole task</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of hatred of all things mechanical; then the grand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son, wise, cunning, a dream-builder; and finally the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great-grandson, Abraham Miller, prepared by three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">generations for the ultimate revenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abraham Miller was the hereditary president of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Colony of Pedestrians hidden in the Ozark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountains. They were isolated, but not ignorant;</seg><seg type="columnLine">few in number but adaptive. The first fugitives had</seg><seg type="columnLine">many brilliant men: inventors, college professors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">patriots and even a learned jurist. These men kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">their knowledge and transmitted it. They dug In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fields, hunted in the woods, fished in the streams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and builded in their laboratories. They even had</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles, and now and then, with limbs tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to their bodies, would travel as spies into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of the enemy. Certain of the children were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained from childhood to act in this capacity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is even evidence that for some years one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these spies lived in St. Louis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a colony with a single ambition--a union</seg><seg type="columnLine">of individuals for one purpose only; the children</seg><seg type="columnLine">lisped it, the school children spoke it daily; the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks whispered it to each other in the moonlight;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratories it was carved on every wall; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senile gathered their children around and swore them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it; every action of the colony was bent toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will go back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were paranoiac in their hatred. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception, all of their ancestors had been hunted like</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild beasts, exterminated without mercy--like ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">min. It was not revenge they desired, but liberty--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right to live as they wished, to go and come as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they pleased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For three generations the colony had preserved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of their existence. Year by year as a unit</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had lived, worked and died for a single ambi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Now the time had come for the execution</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	of their plans, the fulfillment of their desires. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the world of automobilists lived on, material-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istic, mechanical, selfish. • Socialism had provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort for the masses but had singularly failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">provide happiness. All lived, everyone had an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, no one but was provided with a home, food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes. But the homes were of concrete; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform, poured out by the million; the furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concrete, poured with the houses. The cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was paper, water-proofed: it was all in one de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign and was furnished--four suits a year to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">person. The food was sold in bricks, each brick</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing all the elements necessary for the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuation of life; on every brick was stamped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of calories. For centuries, inventors had</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented till finally life became uniform and work a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of push buttons. Yet the world of the auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists was an unhappy one, for no one worked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles. In summer time it was, of course, neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to perspire, but for generations no one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweated. The words "toil," "labor," "work" were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked obsolete in the dictionaries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet no one was happy because it was found to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mechanical impossibility to invent an automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would travel over one hundred and twenty miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour and stay on the ordinary country road. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobilists could not go as fast as they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. Space could not be annihilated; time could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, everyone was toxic. The air was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dangerous vapors generated by the combus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of millions of gallons of gasoline and its sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitutes, even though many machines were electri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied. The greatest factor contributing to this toxe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mia, however, was the greatly reduced excretion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">toxins through the skin and the almost negative pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duction of energy through muscular contraction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The automobilists had ceased to work, using the term</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its purely archaic form, and having ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, they had ceased to sweat. A few hours a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day on a chair in a factory or at a desk was suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient to earn the necessaries of life. The automo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilist never being tired, nature demanded a lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of hours spent in sleep. The remaining hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spent in automobiles, going somewhere; it mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered not where they went so long as they went fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Babies were raised in machines; in fact, all life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in them. The American Home had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared--it was replaced by the automobile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The automobilists were going somewhere but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sure where. The pedestrians were confident of</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Society in its modern sense was socialistic. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">implied that all classes were comfortable. Crime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as such, had ceased to exist some generations pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious, following the putting into force of Bryant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory that all crime was due to 2 per cent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">population and that if these were segregated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sterilized, crime would cease in one generation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Bryant first promulgated his thesis, it was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived with some scepticism, but its practical appli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation was hailed with delight by everyone who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not directly affected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YET even in this apparently perfect society there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were defects. Though everyone had all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessities of life, it was not true of luxuries. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words, there were still rich men and poor men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wealthy still dominated the government and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the laws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the rich there were none more exclusive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aristocratic and dominant than the Heislers. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate on the Hudson was enclosed by thirty miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve-foot iron fence. Few could boast of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited there, of having week-ended in the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace surrounded by a forest of pine, beach and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemlock. They were so powerful that none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family had ever held a public office. They made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presidents, but never cared to have one in the family.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their enemies said that their wealth came from for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate marriages with the Ford and Rockefeller fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilies but, no doubt, this was a falsehood based on</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealousy. The Heislers had banks and real estate;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they owned factories and office buildings. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely stated that they owned the President of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States and the Judges of the Supreme Court.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of their possessions was rarely spoken of, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned in the newspapers. The only child of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruling branch of the family walked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> William Henry Heisler was an unusual millionaire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When told that his wife had presented him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter he promised his Gods (though he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain who they were) that he would spend at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour a day with this child supervising her care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1052</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some months nothing unusual was noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this little girl baby, though at once all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurses commented on her ugly legs. Her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply considered that probably all baby legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the age of one year, the baby tried to stand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a step. Even this was passed over, as the ped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estricians were united in the opinion that all chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren tried to use their legs for a few months, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a bad habit usually easily broken up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb-sucking. They gave the usual advice to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurses which would have been followed had it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for her father who merely stated, "Every child</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a personality. Let her alone, see what she will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do." And in order to insure obedience, he selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his private secretaries, who was to bevin con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant attendance and make daily written reports.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The child grew. There came the time when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer called "baby" but dignified by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of "Margaretta." As she grew, her legs grew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The more she walked, the stronger they became.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no one to help her, for none of the adults</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever walked, nor had they seen anyone walk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She not only walked but she objected in her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby way to mechanical locomotion. She screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a baby wild cat at her first introduction to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile and never could become reconciled even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the auto cars for house use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When it was too late, her father consulted every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who could possibly know anything about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation and its remedy. Heisler wanted his child</seg><seg type="columnLine">to develop her own personality, but he did not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to be odd. He therefore gathered in consulta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, neurologists, anatomists, educators, phycholo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gists, students of child behavior and obtained no</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction from them. All agreed that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiful case of atavism, a throwback. As for a cure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a thousand suggestions from psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">analysis to the brutal splinting and bandaging of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little girl's lower extremeties. Finally, in disgust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heisler paid them all for their trouble and bribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all for their silence and told them sharply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to Hell. He had no idea where this place was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or just what he meant, but found some relief in say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ They all left promptly except one who, in addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to his other vocations, followed geneaolgy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an avocation. He was an old man and they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interesting contrast as they sat facing each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their autocars. Heisler was middle aged, .vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, real leader of men, gigantic save for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunken legs. The other man was old, gray haired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">withered, a dreamer. They were alone in the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save for the child who played happily in the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine of the large bay windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I thought I told you to go to Hell with the rest,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled the leader of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ "How can I ?" was the mild reply. "Those others</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not obey you. They simply autoed out of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. I am waiting for you to tell me how to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Where is this Hell you order us to? Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarines have explored the ocean bed five miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">below sea level. Our aeroplanes have gone some</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles toward the stars. Mount Everest has been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quered. I read all these journeyings, but nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">do I read of a Hell. Some centuries ago theologians</seg><seg type="columnLine">said it was a place that sinners went to when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">died, but there has been no sin since Bryant's two</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent were identified and sterilized. You with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">your millions and limitless power are as near Hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you will ever be, when you look at your abnormal</seg><seg type="columnLine">child."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But she is bright mentally, Professor," protested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heisler; "only seven years old but tested ten years</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Simon Binet Scale.

His mother was captured and killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Indians. They were pedestrians of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced strain; of course, every one was a pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">destrian in those days. The Millers and the Heislers</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermarried. That was some hundred years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your Great Grandfather Heisler, had a sister who</seg><seg type="columnLine">married a Miller. She is spoken of here on page</seg><seg type="columnLine">330. Let me read it to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Margaretta Heisler was the only sister of Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liam Heisler. Independent and odd in many ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she committed the folly of marrying a farmer by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of Abraham Miller, who was one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted leaders in the pedestrian riots in Pennsylvania.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Following his death, his widow and only child, a boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight years old, disappeared and no doubt were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed in the general process of pedestrian exter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination. An old letter written by her to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, prior to her marriage, contained the boast</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she never had ridden in an automobile and never</seg><seg type="columnLine">would; that God had given her legs and she intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use them and that she was fortunate in finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding a man who also had legs and the desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live on them, as God had planned men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There is the secret of this child of yours. She is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reversal to the sister of your great grandfather.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That lady died a hundred years ago rather than fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the fashion. You say yourself that this little</seg><seg type="columnLine">one nearly died from convulsions when the attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE REVOLT OF THE PEDESTRIANS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1053</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was made to put her in an automobile. It is a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of heredity. If you try to break the child of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the habit, you will probably kill her. The only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do is to leave her alone. Let her develop as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes. She is your daughter. Her will is your</seg><seg type="columnLine">will. The probability is that neither can change</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. Let her use her legs. She probably will</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb trees, run, swim, wander where she will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that is the way of it," sighed Heisler. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">means the end of our family. No one would want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry a monkey no matter how intelligent she is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So you think she will some day climb a tree? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a Hell, this is mine, as you suggest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But she is happy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, if laughter is an index. But will she be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she grows older? She will be different. How can</seg><seg type="columnLine">she have associates? Of course they won't afpply</seg><seg type="columnLine">that extermination law in her case; my position will</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent that. I could even have it repealed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she will be lonely--so lonely!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps she will learn to read--then she won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lonely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They both looked at the child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is she doing now?" demanded Heisler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You seem to know more than anyone I ever met</seg><seg type="columnLine">about such things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, she is hopping. Is not that remarkable?</seg><seg type="columnLine">She never saw anyone hop and yet she is doing it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never saw a child do it and yet I can identify it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and give it a name. In Kate Greenaway's illustra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, I have seen pictures of children hopping."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Confound the Millers anyway!" growled Heisler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that conversation, Heisler engaged the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, whose sole duty was to investigate the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pedestrian children and find how they played and</seg><seg type="columnLine">used their legs. Having investigated this, he was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruct the little girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The entire matter of her exercise was left to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus from that day on a curious spectator from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplane might have seen an old man sitting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn showing a golden-haired child pictures from</seg><seg type="columnLine">very old books and talking together about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures. Then the child would do things that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">child had done for a hundred years--bounce a ball,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skip rope, dance folk dances and jump over a bam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boo stick supported by two upright bars. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours were spent in reading and always the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would begin by saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now this is the way they used to do."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Occasionally a party would be given for her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other little girls from the neighboring rich would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and spend the day. They were polite--so was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaretta Heisler--but the parties were not a suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. The company could not move except in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">autocars, and they looked on their hostess with curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity and scorn. They had nothing in common with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curious walking child, and these parties always</seg><seg type="columnLine">left Margaretta in tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why can't I be like other girls?" she demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her father. "Is it always going to be this way?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you know that girls laugh at me because I walk?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heisler was a good father. He hekl to his vow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">devote one hour a day to his daughter, and during</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time gave of his intelligence as eagerly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly as he did to his business in the other hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often he talked to Margaretta as though she were</seg><seg type="columnLine">his equal, an adult with full mental development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have your own personality," he would say</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her. "The mere fact that you are different from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other people does not of necessity mean that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are right and you are wrong. Perhaps you are both</seg><seg type="columnLine">right--at least you are both following out your nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ural proclivities. You are different in desires and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physique from the rest of us, but perhaps you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">more normal than we are. The professor shows us</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures of ancient peoples and they all had legs de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped like yours. How can I tell whether man has</seg><seg type="columnLine">degenerated or improved. At times when I see you</seg><seg type="columnLine">run and jump, I envy you. I and all of us are tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to earth--dependent on a machine for every</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of our daily life. You can go where you please.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can do this and all you need is food and sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In some ways this is an advantage. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, the professor tells me that you can only go</seg><seg type="columnLine">about four miles an hour while I can go over one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why should I want to go so fast when I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not want to go anywhere?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is just the astonishing thing. Why don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to go? It seems that not only your body</seg><seg type="columnLine">but also your mind, your personality, your desires</seg><seg type="columnLine">are old-fashioned, hundreds of years old-fashioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 try to be here in the house or garden every day--</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least an hour--with you, but during the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking hours I want to go. You do the strangest</seg><seg type="columnLine">';hings. The professor tells me about it all. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is your bow and arrow, for instance. I bought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finest firearms and you never use them, but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a bow and arrow from some museum and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed in killing a duck, and the professor said you</seg><seg type="columnLine">built a fire out of wood and roasted it and ate it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You even made him eat some."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it was good, father--much better than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthetic food. Even the professor said the juice</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him feel younger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heisler laughed, "You are a savage--nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a savage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I can read and write!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I admit that.

Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">associates had been mainly elderly men: only occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally would she see the ladies of the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. She tolerated the servants, the maids and</seg><seg type="columnLine">housekeeper. The love she gave her father she also</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave to the old professor, but he had taught her all</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew and the years had made him senile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came to her finally the urge to travel. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to see New York with its twenty million auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobilists; its hundred story office buildings; its</seg><seg type="columnLine">smokeless factories; its standardized houses. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were difficulties in the way of such a trip, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knew these better than her father. The roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">were impossible and all of New York was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">either streets or houses. There being no pedestrians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no need of sidewalks. Besides, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heisler s wealth would not be able to prevent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot sure to result from the presence in a large city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such a curiosity as a pedestrian. Heisler was</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful, but he dreaded the result of allowing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter the freedom of New York. Furthermore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to this time, her deformity was known only to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few. Once she was in New York, the city papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would publish his disgrace to the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SEVERAL of the office buildings in New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">City were one hundred stories high. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no stairways but as a safety precaution circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral ramps had been built in each structure for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of autocars in case the elevators failed to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, however, never happened, and few of the ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants ever knew of their existence. They were used</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night by the scrub women busily autocarring from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one floor to another cleaning up. The higher the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor the purer was the air and the more costly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yearly rental. Below, in the canyon and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, an ozone machine was necessary every few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to purify the air and make unnecessary the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gas masks. On the upper floors, however, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pure breezes from off the Atlantic. Noticeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the absence of flies and mosquitoes; pigeons</seg><seg type="columnLine">built their nests in the crevices, and on the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof a pair of American eagles nested year after</seg><seg type="columnLine">year in haughty defiance of the mechanical auto, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in the newest building in New York and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very highest floor that a new office was opened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the door was the customary gilded sign, "New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York Electrical Co." Boxes had been left there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorators had embellished the largest room, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final result being that it was simply a standardized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">office. A stenographer had been installed and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a noiseless machine, answering, if need be, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this roomy suite one day in June came, by in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitation, a dozen of the leaders of industry. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, each thinking he was the only one invited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conference. Surprise as well as suspicion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marked feature of the meeting. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men there who were secretly and independently</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to undermine Heisler and tear him from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial throne. Heisler himself was there, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently quiet, but inwardly a seething flame of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed electricity. The stenographer seated them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they arrived, in order around a long table. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained in their autocars. No one used chairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One or two of the men joked with each other. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded to Heisler, but none spoke to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The furniture, surroundings, stenographer were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all part of the standard office in the business section.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only one small portion of the room aroused their</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity. At the head of the table was an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. None of the men around the table had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">used a chair; none had seen one save in the Metro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">politan Museum. The autocar had replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair even as the automobile had replaced the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chimes in the tower nearly rang out the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock message. All of the twelve looked at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">watches. One man frowned. His watch was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes late. In another minute all were frowning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had a two-o'clock appointment with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger and he had not kept it. To them, time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a door opened and the man walked in. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first astonishing thing--and then they mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veled at the size and shape of him. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something uncanny about it--peculiar, weird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the man sat down--in the chair. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem much larger now than the the other men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was younger than any of them, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brown complexion which contrasted peculiarly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead gray-white pallor of the others. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravely, almost mechanically, with clear distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">enunciation, he began to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see, gentlemen, that you have all honored me</seg><seg type="columnLine">by accepting my invitation to be present this after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon. You will pardon my not informing any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that the others were also invited. Had I done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, several of you would have refused to come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any one of you the meeting would not be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful as I intended it to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The name of this company is the 'New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electrical Co.'

In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am their president and my name is Abraham Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler. Four generations ago, as, no doubt, you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Congress passed the Pedestrian Extermination Act.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Following that, those who continued to walk were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted like wild animals, slaughtered without mercy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My great-grandfather, Abraham Miller, was killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Pennsylvania; his wife was run down on the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic highway in Ohio as she was attempting to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other pedestrians in the Ozarks. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles, there was no conflict. At that time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only ten thousand pedestrians in all the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States.

A dozen questions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled at him. One man swore at him. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well!" questioned Miller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give us time--a week in which to discuss it--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertain public opinion," urged one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Heisler, "let us give our answer now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, of course," sneered one of his bitter op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponents. "Your reason for giving a decision is plain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it has never been in the newspapers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"For that," said Heisler, "I am going to get you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">You are a cur and you know it or you would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag my family into this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, H--! Heisler--you can't bluff me any more 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller hit the table with his list--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's your answer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men held up his hand for an audience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We all know the history of Pedestrianism: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two groups represented here cannot live together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are two hundred million of us and two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred of them. Let them stay in their valley. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is what I think. If this man is their leader, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge what the colony is like. They are ignorant</seg><seg type="columnLine">anarchists. There is no telling what they would de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand if we listened to them. I think we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have this man arrested. He is a menace to society."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That broke the ice. One after another they spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when they finished, it was plain that all save</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heisler were hostile, antagonistic and merciless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller turned to him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is your verdict?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to keep quiet. These men know it all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have heard them. They are a unit. What I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would say can make no difference. In fact, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care. For some time I have ceased to care about</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller turned in his swivel chair and looked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the city. In some ways it was a pretty city, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">one liked such a place. Under him, in the city streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bee-hives, over twenty million automobilists</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent their lives on wheels. Not one in a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a desire beyond the city limits; the roads con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necting the metropolis with other cities were but</seg><seg type="columnLine">urban arteries wherein the automobiles passed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpuscles, the auto-trucks proceeded like plasma.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller feared the city, but he pitied the legless pig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies inhabiting it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned again and asked for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I Wanted to make a peaceful adjustment. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire no more bloodshed, no more internecine strife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You who lead public sentiment have by your recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk shown me that the pedestrian can expect no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy at the hands of the present Government. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know and I know that this is no longer a nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the people rule. You rule. You .elect whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">you please for senators, for presidents; you snap</seg><seg type="columnLine">your whip and they dance. That is why I came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you men, instead of making a direct appeal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government. Feeling confident what your action</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be, I have prepared this short paper which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will ask you to sign. It contains a single state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'The Pedestrians cannot return.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you have all signed this, I will explain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you just what we will do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why sign it?" said the first man, the one seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right of Miller. "Now my idea is this!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crumpled the paper to a tight ball and threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the table. His conduct was at once followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by applause. Only Heisler sat still. Miller looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the window till all was quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN ALLY he spoke again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"In our colony we have perfected a new elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tro-dynamic principle. Released, it at once separates</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atomic energy which makes possible all move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, save muscle movement. We have tested this</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with smaller machines in limited space and know</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly what we can do. We do not know how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">1056</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STOKIEb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">restore the energy in any territory where we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">once destroyed it. Our electricians are waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my signal transmitted by radio. In fact, they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been listening to all this conversation, and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">now give them the signal to throw the switch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal is our motto,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'We will come back.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that is the signal?" sneered one of the men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing much," replied Heisler, "at least I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difference. What was supposed to happen, Abra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham Miller?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing much," said Miller, "only the destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of all mankind except the pedestrians. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to imagine what would happen when our elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricians threw the switch and released this new prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple, but even our sociologists could not fully imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine what would be the result. We do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether you can live or die--whether any of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can survive. No doubt the city dwellers will die</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily in their artificial bee-hives. Some in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country may survive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, hello!" exclaimed a multi-millionaire, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel no different. You are a dreamer of dreams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am leaving and will report you at once to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police. Open your damn door and let us out!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller opened the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the men pressed their starting button</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took hold of the steering rod. Not a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved. The others startled, tried to leave. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">auto cars were dead. Then one, with a hysterical</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse, raised an automatic at Miller and pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger. There was a click--and nothing more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller pulled out his watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is now 2:40 P. M. The automobilists are be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to die. They do not know it yet. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do, there will be a panic. We cannot give any</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief. There are only a few hundred of us and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot feed and care for hundreds of millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cripples. Fortunately there is a circular inclined</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane or ramp in this building and your autocars are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all equipped with brakes. I will push you one at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to the plane, if you will steer your cars. Ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously you do not care to remain here and equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously the elevators are not running. I will call</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my stenographer to help me. Perhaps you sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected before that he was a pedestrian trained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyhood to take female parts. He is one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">most efficient spies. And now we will say good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bye. A century ago you knowingly and willingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to exterminate us. We survived. We do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to exterminate you, but I fear for your future."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thereupon he went behind one of the autocars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started pushing it towards the doorway. The steno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapher, who had reappeared as a pedestrian, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers, took hold of another car. Soon only</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heisler was left. He held up his hand in protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Would you mind pushing me over to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">window ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller did so. The automobilist looked out curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are no aeroplanes in the sky. There should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hundreds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No doubt," replied Miller, "they have all planed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to earth. You see they have no power."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then everything has stopped ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Almost. There is still muscle power. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still power produced by the bending of wood as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bow and arrow--also that produced by a metal coil</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like the main spring in a watch. You notice your</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch is still running. Of course, domestic animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">can still produce power--that is just a form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle power. In our valley we have grist mills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw mills running by water power. We can see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why they should not keep on; all other power</seg><seg type="columnLine">is destroyed. Do you realize it? There is no elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity, no steam, no explosions of any kind. All those</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines are dead." Heisler pulled out a handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, slowly, automatically and wiped the sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his face as he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can hear a murmur from the city. It rises up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this window like distant surf beating rhythmically</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a sandy shore. I can hear no other noise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only this murmur. It recalls to my mind the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a swarm of bees leaving their old hive and flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">compactly through the air with their queen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center, trying to find a new home. There is a same-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to the noise like a distant waterfall. What does</seg><seg type="columnLine">it mean? I think I know, but I cannot bear to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with words."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means," said Miller, "that below us and around</seg><seg type="columnLine">us twenty million people are beginning to die in of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice buildings, stores and homes; in subways, ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vators and trains; in tubes and ferry boats; on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, and in the restaurant twenty million people</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly realize that they cannot move. No one can</seg><seg type="columnLine">help them. Some have left their cars and are trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull themselves along on their hands, their with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered legs helplessly trailing behind them. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling to each other for help, but' even now they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot know the full extent of the disaster. By to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow each man will be a primitive animal. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days there will be no food, no water. I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will die quickly--before they eat each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The nation will die and no one will know about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there will be no newspapers, no telephones, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless. I will communicate with my people by</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrier pigeons. It will be months before I can re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">join them. Meanwhile I can live. I can go from</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to place. The sound you hear from the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the cry of a soul in despair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEISLER grabbed Miller's hand convulsively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But if you made it stop, you can make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">start ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--we stopped it with electricity. There is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more electricity. I presume our own machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at once put out of power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So we are going to die?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe so. Perhaps your scientists can invent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remedy. We did a hundred years ago. We lived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your nation tried by every known scientific art to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy us, but we lived. Perhaps you can. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">can I tell? We wanted to arbitrate. All we asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for was equality. You saw how those other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted and how they thought. If they had had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, they would instantly have destroyed my little</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony. What we did was simply done in self-pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heisler tried to light his cigar. The electric lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not work, so he held it dry in his mouth, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one corner, chewing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say your name is Abraham Miller? I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve we are cousins of some sort. I have a book</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tells about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know all about that. Your great-grandfather</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my great-grandmother were brother and sister."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I believe that is what the professor said, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE REVOLT OF THE PEDESTRIANS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1057</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that at that time we did not know about you. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to talk about, however, is my daughter.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men talked on and on. The murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to mount from the city, unceasing, inces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sant, full of notes new to the present generation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet at the distance--from the earth below to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundredth story above, it was all one sound. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of millions of variants, it blended into</seg><seg type="columnLine">unity. Miller finally began walking up and down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one office wall to the window and back again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought no one more free from nerves than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was. My whole life has been schooled in prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for this moment. We had right, justice, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">our forgotten God on our side. I still can see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way, no other way, but this makes me sick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heisler; it nauseates me. When I was a boy I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mouse caught in a barn door, almost torn in two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to help it and the tortured animal bit my</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger so I simply had to break its neck. It couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">live--and when I tried to help it, it bit me, so, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to kill it. Do you understand? I had to, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I was justified, I grew deadly sick; I vomited</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the barn floor. Something like that is going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">below there. Twenty million deformed bodies all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us are beginning to die. They might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been men and women like those we have in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony but they became obsessed with the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical devices of all kinds. If I tried to help--</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the street now--they would kill, me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't keep them off me--I couldn't kill them fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. We were justified--man--we were justi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, but it makes me sick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Tt does not affect me that way," replied Heisler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am accustomed to crushing out my opponents. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to, or they would crush me. I look on all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a wonderful experiment. For years I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought about our civilization--on account of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter. I have lost interest. In many ways I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lost my fighting spirit. I don't seem to care</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happens, but I would like to follow that cur</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the circular spiral plane and wrap my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his neck. I don't want him to die of hunger."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. You stay here. I want you to write a</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of it all--just how it happened. We want</seg><seg type="columnLine">an accurate record to justify our action. You stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and work with my stenographer. I am going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find your daughter. We cannot let a pedestrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer. We will take you back with us. With suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able apparatus you could learn to ride a horse."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You want me to live?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but not for yourself. There are a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons. For the next twenty years you can lecture</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our young people. You can tell them what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened when the world ceased to work, to sweat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they deliberately exchanged the home for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile and toil and labor for machinery. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell them that and they will believe you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonderful!" exclaimed Heisler. "I have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presidents and now I become a legless example for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will attain fame. You will be the last auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobilist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's start," urged Heisler. "Call your stenog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapher !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stenographer had been in New York one</seg><seg type="columnLine">month prior to the meeting of Miller and the repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentatives of the automobilists. During that time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks to his early training in mimicry as a spy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been absolutely successful in deceiving all he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came in contact with. In his autocar, dressed as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenographer, his face perfumed and painted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings on his fingers, he passed unnoticed amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other thousands of similar Women. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their restaurants and to their theatres. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited them in their homes. He was the perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy; but he was a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He had been trained to the work of a spy. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years he had been imbued with loyalty to an en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm for his republic of pedestrians. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sworn to the oath--that the republic should come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first. Abraham Miller had selected him because he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could trust him. The spy was young, with hardly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a down on his cheeks. He was celibate. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">patriotic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">T)UT for the first time in his life, he was in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">big city. The firm on the floor below employed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a stenographer. She was a very efficient worker in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more ways than one and there was that about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">new stenographer that excited her interest. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">met and arranged to meet again. They talked about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">love, the new love between women. The spy did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not understand this, having never heard of such a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passion, but he did understand eventually, the caresses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and kisses. She proposed that they room together,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but he naturally found objections. However, they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had spent much of their spare time together. 'More</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than once the pedestrian had been 011 the point of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">confiding to her, not only concerning the impending</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">calamity, but also his real sex and his true love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In such cases where a man falls in love with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman the explanation is hard to find. It is al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ways hard to find. Here there was something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twisted, a pathological perversion. It was a mons-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trous thing that he should fall in love with a legless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman when he might by waiting, have married a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman with columns of ivory and knees of ala-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">baster. Instead, he loved and desired a woman who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lived in a machine. It was equally pathological that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she should love a woman. Each was sick--soul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sick, and each to continue the intimacy deceived the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other. Now with the city dying beneath him, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stenographer felt a deep desire to save this legless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman. I-Ie felt that a way could be found, some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how, to persuade Abraham Miller to let him marry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this stenographer--at least let him save her from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">debacle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So in soft shirt and knee trousers he cast a glance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at Miller and Heisler engaged in earnest conversa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion and then tiptoed out the door and down the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inclined plane to the floor below. Here all was con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fusion. Boldly striding into the room where the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stenographer had her desk, he leaned over her and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started to talk. He told her that he was a man, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pedestrian. Rapidly came the story of what it all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">■meant, the cries from below, the motionless auto-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cars, the useless elevators, the silent telephones. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">told her that the world of automobilists would die</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">because of this and that, but that she would live</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">because of his love for her. All he. asked was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">legal right to care for her, to protect her. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would go somewhere and live, out in the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He would roll her around the meadows. She could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have geese, baby geese that would come to her chair</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when she cried, "Weete, weete."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The legless woman listened. What pallor there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might be in her cheeks was skillfully covered with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rouge. She listened and looked at him, a man, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">1058</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man with legs, walking. He said he loved her, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the person she had loved was a woman; a woman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with dangling, shrunken, beautiful legs like her own,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not muscular monstrosities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed hysterically, said she would marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, go wherever he wanted her to go, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she clasped him to her and kissed him full on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, and then kissed his neck over the jugular</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins, and he died, bleeding into her mouth, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood mingled with rouge made her face a vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">carmine. She died some days later from hunger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller never knew where his stenographer died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he time he might have hunted for him, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to share Heisler's anxiety about the pedes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trian girl isolated and alone amid a world of dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobilists. To the father she was a daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only child, the remaining and sole branaji of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">family. To Miller, however, she was a symbol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was a sign of nature's revolt, an indication of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her last spasmodic effort to restore mankind to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former place in the world. Her father wanted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved because she was his daughter, the pedestrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she was one of them, one of the race of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestrians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On that hundredth floor kegs of water, stores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food had been provided. Every provision had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to sustain life in the midst of death. Heisler</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shown all these. He was made comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Miller, with some provisions, a canteen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, a road map, and a stout club in his grasp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">left that place of peace and quiet and started down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spiral stairway. At the best it was simply diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult walking, the spirals being wide enough to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent dizziness. What Miller feared was the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of the entire passage at some point by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled mass of autocars, but evidently all cars which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had managed to reach the plane had been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend. He paused now and then at this floor or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, shuddered at the cries he heard and then went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, down, down into the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here it was even worse than he expected. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second the electro-dynamic energy had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased from the Ozark valley--on that very second</seg><seg type="columnLine">all machinery had ceased. In New York City twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">million people were in automobiles or autocars at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that particular second. Some were working at desks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shops; some were eating in restaurants, loafing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their clubs; others were going somewhere. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly everyone was forced to stay where he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no cqmmunication save within the limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each one's voice; the phone, radio, newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were useless. Every autocar stopped; every auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile ceased to move. Each man and woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependent on his own body for existence; no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could help the other, no one could help himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Transportation died and no one knew it had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened save in his own circle, as far as the eye could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see or the ear could hear, because communication</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died with the death of transportation. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobilist stayed where he happened to be at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN slowly as the thought came to them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement was impossible, there came fear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear, panic. But it was a new kind of panic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All previous panics consisted in the sudden move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of large numbers of people in the same direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, fleeing from a real or an imaginary fear. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic was motionless and for a day the average</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Yorker, while gripped with fear, crying with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright, remained within his car. Then came mass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement but not the movement of previous panics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the slow tortuous movement of crippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals dragging legless bodies forward by arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">unused to muscular exercise. It was not the rapid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-like movement of the frenzied panic stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob, but a slow, convulsive, worm-like panic. Word</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passed from one to another in hoarse whisper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings that the city was a place of death, would be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a morgue, that in a few days there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no food. While no one knew what had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone knew that the city could not live long un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less food came regularly from the country, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country suddenly became more than long cement</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads between sign-boards. It was a place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">food could be procured and water. The city had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become dry. The mammoth pump throwing mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of gallons of water to a careless population had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to pump. There was no more water save in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rivers encircling the city and these were filth}',</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-polluted. In the country there must be water</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, on the second day began the flight from New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York--a flight of cripples, not of eagles; a passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of humanity shaped like war-maimed soldiers. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed was not uniform, but the fastest could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl less than a mile an hour. Philosophers would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stayed where they were and died. Animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus tortured, would quietly wait the end, but these</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobilists were neither philosophers nor animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they had to move. All their life they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving. The bridges were the first spaces to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">congestion. On all of them were some automobiles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but traffic is not heavy at 2 in the afternoon. Gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, by noon of the second day, these river highways</seg><seg type="columnLine">were black with people crawling to get away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. There came congestion, and with conges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, stasis, and with stasis, simply a writhing with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out progression. Then on top of this stationary</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer of humanity crawled another layer which in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its turn reached congestion, and on top of the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond layer a third layer. A dozen streets led to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge but each bridge was only as wide as a street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gradually the outer rows of the upper layer began</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling into the river beneath. Ultimately many</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought this termination. From the bridges came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimately, a roar like surf beating against a rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound shore. In it was the beginnings of desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness. Men died quickly on the bridges, but be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they died they started to bite each other. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city certain places showed the same congestion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Restaurants and cafes became filled with bodies al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to the ceiling. There was food here but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could reach it save those next to it and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were crushed to death before they could profit by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their good fortune, and dying, blocked with bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who remained alive and able to eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within twenty-four hours mankind had lost its</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion, its humanity, its high ideals. Every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to keep himself alive even though by doing so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he brought death sooner to others. Yet in isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">instances, individuals rose to heights of heroism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the hospitals an occasional nurse remained with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her patients, giving them food till she with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">died of hunger. In one of the maternity wards a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother gave birth to a child. Deserted by every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one she placed the child to her breast and kept it</seg><seg type="columnLine">there till hunger pulled down her lifeless arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE REVOLT OF THE PEDESTRIANS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1059</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was into this world of horror that Miller walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he emerged from the office building. He had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided himself with a stout club but hardly any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling automobilists noticed him. So he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly over to Fifth Avenue and then headed north,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he walked he prayed, though on that first day</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw but little of what he was to see later on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On and on he went till he came to water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he swam and then again he went on and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">night he was out in the country where he ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pray continuously. Here he met an occasional auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist, who was simply annoyed at his machine break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down. No one in the country realized at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had really happened; no one ever fully realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he died in his farm house, just what it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant. It was only the city dwellers that knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they did not understand.	\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day Miller rose early from the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started again, after carefully consulting the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">map. He avoided the towns, circling them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned the desire, constant, incessant, inescap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, to share his provisions with those starving crip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ples, and he had to keep his strength and save food</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her, that pedestrian girl, alone among helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants, within an iron fence thirty miles long. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was near the close of the second day of his walk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For some miles he had seen 110 one. The sun low</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the forest of oaks threw fantastic shadows over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the concrete road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the road, ever nearing him came a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan. There were three horses tied to each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the backs of two were bundles and jugs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water fastened stoutly but clumsily. On the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse an old man rested in a chair-like saddle and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time he slept, his chin resting on his chest, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clutching, even in sleep, the sides of the chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leading the first horse walked a woman, tall, strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely in her strength, striding with easy pace along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cement road. On her back was slung a bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quiver of arrows and in her right hand she</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a heavy cane. She walked on fearlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidently; she seemed filled with power, confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller paused in the middle of the road. The cara-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">van came near him. Then it stopped in front of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said the woman, and her voice blended</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously with the sunlit shadows and the flickering</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well! Who are you and why do you block our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I am Abraham Miller and you are Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garctta Heisler.

He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the young man and woman, standing, talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, already forgetting that there was anything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, that is the way it was in the old days,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">mused the professor to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a Sunday afternoon some hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. A father and his little son were sightseeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Museum of Natural Sciences in the recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed city of New York. The whole city was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now simply a vast museum. Folks went there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it but no one wanted to live there. In fact, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one wanted to live in such a place as a city when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could live on a farm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a part of every child's education to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day or more in an automobilist's city, so on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday afternoon the father and his little son walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly through the large buildings. They saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mastodon, the bison, the pterodactyl. They paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time before a glass case containing a wig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wam of the American Indian with a typical Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">family. Finally they came to a large wagon, on four</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber wheels, but there was no shaft and no way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that horses or oxen could be harnessed to it. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon on seats were men, women and little children.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy looked at them curiously and pulled at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, daddy. What are that wagon and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny people without legs. What does it mean?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That my son is a family of automobilists," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and then he paused and gave his son the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk that all pedestrian fathers are required by law</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give to their children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE END</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Metal Emperor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A.

This fact was described at length in "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">London Scientific Gazette of 1900." (See Vol. XX,</seg><seg type="columnLine">No. 19, page 39.) It attracted much attention at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, but it was declared commercially impractical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the reason that, it was argued, it was not neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to build a giant wireless station at a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">expense in order to talk clear around the globe, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to one's own voice; one could talk to one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">self without the expensive radio?

I based my invention upon this great</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shaft of the cage was connected to a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo, which was operated at high speed as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the mouse or rat started the cage revolving. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo, in turn, was connected to a little wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">set and this in turn was connected to an aerial wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">system on the roof of the house. The wireless set</seg><seg type="columnLine">was constructed in such a manner that when oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated, it would send out a call similar to a Western</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union call box. In each locality we had a wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">"central" with operators. As soon as one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operators received a call, he would look up his call</seg><seg type="columnLine">book and see where the call originated. Tffis took</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few seconds. A man would then be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patched immediately to the house in question, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie would brain the mouse or rat single handed, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot, by means of a club. He would next reset</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trap and return to headquarters, giving a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">itemized report of the case. To the inexperienced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my system of killing the rodents might appear rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-winded and expensive, but this is just where</seg><seg type="columnLine">my insight into human nature came to the fore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me famous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not everybody likes to kill rats and mice.

Thus I could set the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prepare you for the story--getting you under</seg><seg type="columnLine">tension, as the editor calls it technically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a plain matter of fact, however, the aerial wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">were full of sleet and therefore could not "sing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Furthermore I was glad that they didn't come down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that would have caused hardly pleasant music.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the log fire, too, could not very well have cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic shadows, or any other shadows for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, because the log fire happened to be a radiator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of casting fantastic shadows, however, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast about a lot of rank noise and every now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then made me jump clean out of my chair. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the cat have purred very readily on the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">because to begin with it wasn't a cat at all, but a dog;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could not have purred even if he had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessons at $5 an hour. There were good reasons for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this, too. Firstly, it was not a he; it was a she.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secondly, she had been dead for two years and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she was stuffed so nicely did I keep her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thirdly, she could positively not have sat on a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">near by, simply because there was only one chair in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place and 1 was on it. Fourthly, dogs, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead dogs, are not known to dream about appetizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">canary birds. Then, too, no windows could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattled in the storm, for my radio station is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar and that cellar has no windows whatsoever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As for the trees moaning plaintively, or otherwise, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained above that my people were engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cactus farming. There are no trees on such-a farm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cactus positively does not moan in a storm. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW' that you understand the situation fully, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will proceed. It was after 12 o'clock midnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a cold winter night. My new, loud-talking tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone receivers were on my head and I had just lit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh pipe. I had been flirting with my vario-selec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive coupling-balance which was adjusted to a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long wavelength--96,000 meters, if my memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">serves me right--and I was just in the act of tuning</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the wave length of FL.--that's the Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eiffel Tower Station. Suddenly, a very faint, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceedingly high pitched screaming sound, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my receivers, becoming louder and louder</seg><seg type="columnLine">each second. While I was still wondering what this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly sound could be, I heard, in a faint but</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alier, Yankton, Mpss.--80,000 meters." This</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence was repeated several times. I lost no time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting my 200 Kilowatt generator, tuned up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">^0,000 meters, and yelled into the transmitter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ship ahoy!

So I took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin lying nearby and shoved it into my thigh. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew then that I was really awake. I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, but I had to laugh outright. Why, the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was preposterous! Some practical radio amateur</seg><seg type="columnLine">joker, no doubt, who tried to get me on the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then afterward make me the laughing stock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good stunt!

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock nearby started to strike 1 o'clock. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still vibrating in the air when I witnessed a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable phenomenon. The dark portion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon was suddenly faintly illuminated with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet phosphorescence which I had seen only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds earlier around my receivers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to me as if there were a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight stationed on the bright side of the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing a colossal shaft of that scarlet light over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the dark side. This shaft of light was not sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary; it swept rapidly back and forward over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark face of the moon, illuminating the moon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">craters in a wonderful fashion. The phosphorescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">light shaft was so long that it actually went clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the face of the moon and swept out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space beyond for a considerable distance. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most magnificent, inspiring spectacle I had ever wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed in my life. Suddenly, the light vanished for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short period, just as the mysterious person had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would. 1 counted to 10. Just as suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping light shaft reappeared, brushing the moon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark face backward and forward several times, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. The light disappeared again; I counted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">10 and it reappeared, going through the identical mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions for the third and last time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few seconds I stood fascinated, probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my mouth wide open. Like one in a trance, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down to the radio and I still remember that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my teeth chattered violently and that I had a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill, which shook me from head to foot, while I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justed the 'phones over my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> T had scarcely finished, when the high pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming sound was heard again, and in a few sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds the voice with the graveyard tone spoke once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I trust, my boy, that you will not again doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baron Munchhausen's word," Here I could dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguish a low chuckle. "But tell me, how did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like my little exhibition ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, your excellency." I stammered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter before me, "I really had no idea of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">offending you before, the whole thing seemed so im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to me that you can hardly blame me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubting you. However, after seeing your wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful lunar fireworks, I stand ready to believe anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everything that you may say. I assure you, 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">will swear by it. But would you be so kind as to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer the burning question which is uppermost in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind just now? Am I not correct in my assumption</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your excellency was born in Hanover, Germany,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1720 and was buried in 1/97 in the same locality?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most assuredly, my boy, you have stated the facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly. As you say, I was buried in 1797, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were to open the coffin to-day, you would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the bones of Baron Munchhausen. For political</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons, it was very desirable for me to 'die' in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1797. If I had not 'died' just then, I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hanged, no doubt. So I had a wax replica of</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself made, which resembled me so closely, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">even deceived my trusted valet, Fritz, who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">within an ace of placing me in the coffin, while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping peacefully, but soundly, in a secret room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attic. If I had not sneezed in my sleep, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly they would have buried me, and let my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wax replica shift for itself in an unfriendly world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While this might have been a regrettable accident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would hardly have affected me much, for I am im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal, as you no doubt know!" A chuckle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">discerned by me at this pun; the Baron, no doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked his own little joke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, in the absence of Fritz, that blunderer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosskopf, the embalmer, entered the house very,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much under the influence of schnapps and by pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance found the secret room. He saw me sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundly and thought, of course, that I was dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either because he was too lazy or else too drunk, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never knew which, he did not cut me open and em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balm me in the usual manner; luckily for me. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead he used a hollow needle and injected the em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balming fluid into my veins. I am a sound sleeper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very sound sleeper, so I did not wake for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. As time goes, a very long time indeed. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">be accurate, I did not wake up for 110 years. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">embalming fluid that Rosskopf used on me was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently a good brand, for it did not- wear out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 years, i. e., till A.

It seems that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">embalming fluid made my body rigid and stiff as</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, and to all intents and purposes, unknown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I was as dead as my wax replica, which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried the same afternoon. However, it seems my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart continued to beat faintly through all these years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the prolonged rest, instead of aging my body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">really made me younger.

He feted and dined me and insisted that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of Hanover should give a fitting celebration in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my honor. This, however, I declined modestly. Dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the course of the dinner, he told me that, due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all good traditions of German official red tape, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and estate were still in the process of liquida-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, as I had neglected to leave a will. I filed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">will that very day and my lawyers assured me that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could prove my identity without doubt, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to inherit my own estate within at least 25</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. They further assured me that I need have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no misgivings as to my political offenses which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed 110 years ago; they argued that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">offenses had been outlawed. That took a big load off</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. Well, I guess we've chatted long enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for to-day, besides my power is getting low. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Your Excellency," I shouted back into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter breathlessly, "won't you please explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">how you come to be on such an outlandish place as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon, and if you are there, how you can exist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there is certainly no atmosphere on the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the temperature is below zero. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I would gladly tell you all this now, but it takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to explain these things," the sound came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">very weak and distant, "but as I said before, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">power is getting low, so if you will be at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">'phones to-morrow night at 11 p. m., terrestrial time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will gladly satisfy your curiosity.

How Muenchhausen and the Allies Took Berlin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I CONFESS that I put in a bad night after my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first radio telephone talk with the Baron on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">memorable December night. My dreams were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild and fearsome and I awoke at frequent inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals, bathed in perspiration. The whole thing was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny, so preposterous, that when I finally opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes the next morning I began to wonder if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing had not been a wild, extravagant dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As yet I had not told anyone about Munchhausen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of inevitable ridicule, so by noontime I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become thoroughly convinced that I had dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing from beginning to end. But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat down to lunch and my elder brother asked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I had knocked him down on the stairs on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">return from the lodge the night before, I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the episode was not a dream after all. So I told my</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of my experience and recited my conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with Mr. Munchhausen. They did not wax en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiastic as the story proceeded. Instead, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, my father took a deep breath, gave me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer look and tapped his forehead with his index</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger. That was the extent of his comment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">then gave vent to a disgusted snort and started with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My younger brother sang to the tune of "Apple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blossom time in Normandy":</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the Nuts are getting ripe in 'Squirreltown!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">My older brother remarked casually that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">read not so long ago about an eminent Eastern doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor who found that strong radio waves had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar property of producing little explosions in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the brain. A coherer action, as it were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, he said, produced what the doctor termed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"wireless brainstorm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A rather dangerous disease, closely resembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrophobia," my brother remarked, before attacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest of my family all made similar intelligent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">comments, and as the case proved hopeless, I kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet and said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening, however, shortly before 11 o'clock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I summoned the yawning obstreperous members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my family to the radio room and fitted everyone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a radio telephone headset; these headsets were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected to my own trusty receivers. I then told my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little audience to watch the clock and be prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to the most remarkable discourse ever held</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two humans. Nor did I disappoint my</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience. The clock had hardly finished striking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleventh hour, when the (to me) familiar high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched screaming' sound was heard again, and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds later Munchhausen's voice vibrated power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully into our receivers:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good evening, my son," he said in his sepulchral</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, "I trust you have had pleasant dreams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that last night's experience has not disturbed you too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hastened to reply that I was doing nicely, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I found it difficult to persuade my doubting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomases that his Excellency had really come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to life. At this Munchhausen laughed heartily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that he had expected as much. He added that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if further proofs were wanted, he would be happy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give another lunar exhibition. He volunteered, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition to sweep the moon's dark quarter this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">night with any color we desired, in order to convince</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the most skeptical that his return was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoax. I could tell by the faces of my hearers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were beginning to become impressed. A vote</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the audience, held right then and there, deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined the color to be green. I transmitted this in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence to the Baron at once, whereupon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to light up the invisible dark quarter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon in a green phosphorescence for the duration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 20 seconds, beginning at 11.30 p. m. He added</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARON MUNCHHAUSEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In less than one second over 500 men were baled together tighter than a bale of compressed cotton-and as helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that our conversation was to be resumed after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"performance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We thereupon repaired to the roof of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody keyed to the highest excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I will not go into lengthy details; suffice it to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, true to his word, at exactly 11.30 p. m. Miinch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausen swept the dark part of the moon's surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an immense shaft of a green phosphorescence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to the exhibition he had given fdr me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before. If anything, the light shaft was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful; this, however, might have been due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's atmosphere being clearer than on the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 need not go to the trouble of explaining that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one of my family was thoroughly convinced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All were silent and awe-struck, and all were as ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I was to believe anything that Miinchhausen might</seg><seg type="columnLine">say; and I assure you I was thoroughly convinced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the exhibition, we resumed our seats in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio room, and I suggested that my brother take</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenographic notes of the conversation--he was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert stenographer and had been a reporter on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York Times for five years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I may add, therefore, that all conversations be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween Baron Miinchhausen and myself, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall publish hereafter, are exactly as stated, taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my brother's stenographic reports.

What? Let it be known, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Baron Miinchhausen is, as usual, ready for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergencies.

There were about ten brass</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands in front of my house, and I estimate that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least three-quarters of the population were assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the bands, waiting to see me. I dressed hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly and stepped out on the balcony, greeted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafening 'Hochs,' 'Vivat Muenchhausen' and 'Lang</seg><seg type="columnLine">soli er leben.' Then someone yelled for a speech, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I responded, delivering an appropriate address</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the occasion. I had hardly finished, when two</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladders were leaned against my balcony and two en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thused 'Corps Studenteri had carried me bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into a gala automobile, bedecked gaily with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunting. One of the students, in full dress, took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat at the steering wheel, while ten others, also in</seg><seg type="columnLine">full dress, started to pull the automobile in a tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphant entry through the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was indeed a strange cortege, and you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a full report of it in the German daily press of</seg><seg type="columnLine">September the 30th, 1907.

The next few days were crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hundreds of interviews with reporters and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">private individuals, while attention and kindness were</seg><seg type="columnLine">showered over me unendingly.

When history is finally written</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will find that it was I who made the difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">work possible. I personally conducted the invasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was, indeed, a brilliant success. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">clash with the Germans was spectacular. We rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them in the early morning, but instead of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">artillery using the ordinary explosive shells we used</seg><seg type="columnLine">my compressed laughing gas cylinders. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed in such a way that they would open upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking the ground. The soldiers of the rank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">file were equipped with a similar device, and. instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shooting bullets, they shot compressed laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas cylinders. These cylinders were shot from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle at a rather close range and were not supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate the bodies of the enomy. Instead, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders had a short rubber nose which, upon strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, actuated a trigger, and this in turn opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward end of the cylinder, releasing the gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our first attack proved as great an astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us as to the enemy.

The rock salt, when shot from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rifle or gun, had not enough piercing power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate the bodies of the enemy, but it went easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean through the soldiers' uniforms and then buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself under their skins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you have ever had a salty solution applied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open wound you will appreciate what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I began pumping rock salt into the Imperial</seg><seg type="columnLine">German army.

It will not touch the gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulator unless you push it down on it by applying</seg><seg type="columnLine">an external force.

Pollock had an ____</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">irritating persuasion of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">having made an absolute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fool of himself; he felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bitter, savage, at the turn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">things had taken. At the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same time, he would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to tell Waterhouse -- the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moral, exemplary, cautious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Waterhouse -- who would	1	--^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Inevitably take the matter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seriously. Pollock cursed bitterly at his luck, at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Waterhouse, and especially at the West Coast of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Africa. He felt consummately sick of the expedi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion. And in the back of his mind all the time was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speculative doubt where precisely within the visible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horizon the Porroh man might be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is perhaps rather shocking, but he was not at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all upset by the murder that had just happened. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had seen so much brutality during the last three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">months, so many dead women, burnt huts, drying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">skeletons, up the Kittam River in the wake of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sofa cavalry, that his senses were blunted. What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">T-TF-RE is an extraordimry story by Mr. Wells, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">■* -1 deals with the occult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Many are the tales brought back from tropical sections</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of our earth, where the aborigines have often been re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">corded as being able to cast certain spells over their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">victims, hypnotic or otherwise. Mr. Wells has exploited</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this phase to a marked degree'. This story, frankly, gives</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on.° the creeps, yet, holds one's interest to the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1073</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disturbed him was the persuasion that this business</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was only beginning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He swore savagely at the black, who ventured</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to ask a question, and went on into the tent under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orange-trees where Waterhouse was lying, feeling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exasperatingly like a boy going into the head master's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Waterhouse was still sleeping off the effects of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">last dose of chlorodyne, and Pollock sat down on a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">packing-case beside him, and lighting his pipe,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waited for him to awake. About him were scat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tered the pots and weapons Waterhouse had col-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lected from the Mendi people, and which he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been repacking for the canoe voyage to Sulyma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Presently Waterhouse woke up, and after judicial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stretching, decided he was all right again. Pollock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">got him some tea. Over the tea the incidents of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon were described by Pollock, after some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">preliminary beating about the bush. Waterhouse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">took the matter even more seriously than Pollock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had anticipated. He did not simply disapprove, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scolded, he insulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "You're one of those infernal fools who think a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black man isn't a human being," he said. "I can't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be ill a day without you must get into some dirty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scrape or other. This is the third time in a month</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that you have come crossways-on with a native, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this time you're in for it with a vengeance. Porroh,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too! _ They're down upon you enough as it is, about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that idol you wrote your silly name on. And they're</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the most vindictive devils on earth! You make a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man ashamed of civilization. To think you come of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a decent family! If ever I cumber myself up with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a vicious, stupid young lout like you again--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Steady on, now," snarled Pollock, in the tone that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">always exasperated Waterhouse; "steady on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   At that Waterhouse became speechless. He jumped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Look here, Pollock," he said, after a struggle to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">control his breath. "You must go home. I won't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have you any longer. I'm ill enough as it is through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Keep your hair on," said Pollock, staring in front</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of him. "I'm ready enough to go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Waterhouse became calmer again. He sat down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the camp-stool. "Very well," he said. "I don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">want a row, Pollock, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know, but it's confound-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">edly annoying to have one's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plans put out by this kind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of thing. I'll come to Sul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yma with you, and see you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safe aboard--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "You needn't," said Pol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lock. "I can go alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ _ From here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                          "Not far," said Water-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   , .	house. "You don't under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stand this Porroh business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How should / know she belonged to a Porroh</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man ?" said Pollock bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, she did," said Waterhouse; "and you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">undo the thing. Go alone, indeed! I wonder what</seg><seg type="columnLine">theyd do to you. You don't seem to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this Porroh hokey-pokey rules this country, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">its law, religion, constitution, medicine, magic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They appoint the chiefs. The Inquisition, at its best</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn t hold a candle to these chaps. He will prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably set Awajale, the chief here, on to us.

And, of course, you must go and miss</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He thought, and his thoughts seemed disagree-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able. Presently he stood up and took his rifle. I d</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">keep close for a bit, if I were you," he said, over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder, as he went out "I'm going out to see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what I can find out about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pollock remained sitting in the tent, meditating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I was meant for a civilizcd life,' he said to him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self, regretfully, as he filled his pipe. "The sooner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I get back to London or Paris the better for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His eye fell on the sealed case in which Water-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house had put the featherless poisoned arrows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they had bought in the Mendi country. "I wish I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had hit the beggar somewhere vital," saic^ Pollock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">viciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Waterhouse came back after a long interval. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not communicative, though Pollock asked him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">questions enough. The Porroh man, it seems, was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a prominent member of that mystical society. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">village was interested, but not threatening. No</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doubt the witch-doctor had gone into the bush. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a great witch-doctor. "Of course, he s up to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something," said Waterhouse, and became silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But what can he do?" asked Pollock, unheeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I must get you out of this. There's something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brewing, or things would not be so quiet, said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Waterhouse, after a gap of silence. Pollock wanted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to know what the brew might be. "Dancing m a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">circle of skulls," said Waterhouse; "brewing a stink</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a copper pot." Pollock wanted particulars. Watei-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house was vague, Pollock pressing. At last W ater-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house lost his temper. "How the devil should I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know ?" he said to Pollock's twentieth inquiry what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Porroh man would do. "He tried to kill you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off-hand in the hut. Now, I fancy he will try some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing more elaborate. But you'll see fast enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I don't want to help unnerve you. It's probably all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nonsense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That night, as they were sitting at their hre,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock again tried to draw Waterhouse out on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">subject of Porroh methods. "Better get to sleep,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said Waterhouse, when Pollock's bent became ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">parent; "we start early to-morrow. You may want</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all your nerve about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But what line will he take?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Can't say. They're versatile people. They know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a lot of rum dodges. You'd better get that copper-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">devil, Shakespear, to talk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a flash and a heavy bang out of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">darkness behind the huts, and a clay bullet came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whistling close to Pollock's head. This, at least, was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crude enough. The blacks and half-breeds sitting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and yarning round their own fire jumped up, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">someone fired into the dark.	., ,,r ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Better go into one of the huts, said W aterhouse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quietly, still sitting unmoved.	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pollock stood up by the fire and drew his revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fighting, at least, he was not afraid of. But a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the dark is in the best of armor. Realizing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wisdom of Waterhouse's advice, Pollock went into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tent and lay down there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WHAT little sleep he had was disturbed by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreams, variegated dreams, but chiefly of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Porroh man's face, upside down, as he went out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the hut, and looked up under his arm. It was odd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that this transitory impression should have stuck so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">firmly in Pollock's memory. Moreover, he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">troubled by queer pains in his. limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the white haze of tha early morning, as they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were loading the canoes, a barbed arrow suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appeared quivering in the ground close to Pollock's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foot. The boys made a perfunctory effort to clear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out the thicket, but it led to no capture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After these two occurrences, there was a disposi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion on the part of the expedition to leave Pollock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to himself, and Pollock became, for the first time in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his life, anxious to mingle with blacks. Waterhouse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">took one canoe, and Pollock, in spite of a friendly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">desire to chat with Waterhouse, had to take the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other. He was left all alone in the front part of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the canoe, and he had the greatest trouble to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the men--who did not love him--keep to the middle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the river, a clear hundred yards or more from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">either shore. However, he made Shakespear, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Freetown half-breed, come up to his own end of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">canoe and tell him about Porroh, which Shakespear,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">failing in his attempts to leave Pollock alone, pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ently did with considerable freedom and gusto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The day passed. The canoe glided swiftly along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ribbon of lagoon water, between the drift of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">water-figs, fallen trees, papyrus, and palm-wine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">palms, and with the dark mangrove swamp to the left,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through which one could hear now and then the roar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Atlantic surf. Shakespear told in his soft,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blurred English of how the Porroh could cast spells;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how men withered up under their malice; how they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could send dreams and devils; how they tormented</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and killed the sons of Ijibu; how they kidnapped a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white trader from Sulyma who had maltreated one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the sect, and how his body looked when it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found. And Pollock, after each narrative, cursed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under his breath at the want of -missionary enter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prise that allowed such things to be, and at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inert British Government that ruled over this dark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heathendom of Sierra Leone. In the evening they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came to the ICasi Lake, and sent a score of crocodiles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lumbering off the island on which the expedition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">camped for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next day they reached Sulyma, and smelt the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sea breeze, but Pollock had to put up there for five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days before he could get on to Freetown. Water-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house, considering him to be comparatively safe here,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and within the pale of Freetown influence, left him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and went back with the expedition to Gbemma, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock became very friendly with Perera, the only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resident white trader at Sulyma--so friendly, in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deed, that he went about with him everywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Perera was a little Portuguese Jew, who had lived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in England, and he appreciated the Englishmans</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">friendliness as a great compliment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For two days nothing happened out of the or-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dinary ; for the' most part Pollock and Perera played</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nap--the only game they had in common--and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock got into debt. Then, on the second evening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock had a disagreeable intimation of the arrival</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Porroh man in Sulyma by getting a flesh-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wound in the shoulder from a lump of filed iron. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a long shot, and the missile had nearly spent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its force when it hit him. Still, it conveyed its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">message plainly enough. Pollock sat up in his ham-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mock, revolver in. hand, all that night, and next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">morning confided, to some extent, in the Anglo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Perera took the matter seriously. He knew the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  local customs pretty thoroughly. "It is a personal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  question, you must know. It is revenge. And, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">POLLOCK AND THE PORROH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course, he is hurried by your leaving de country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">None of de natives or half-breeds will interfere wid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him very much--unless you make it wort deir while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If you come upon him suddenly, you might shoot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him. But den he might shoot you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">„ "Den dere's dis--infernal magic," said Perera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, I don't believe in it--superstition--but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still it's not nice to tink dat wherever you are, dere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a black man, who spends a moonlight night now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and den a-dancing about a fire to send you bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreams. . . . Had any bad dreams ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Rather," said Pollock. "I keep on seeing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beggar's head upside down grinning at me and show-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing all his teeth as he did in the hut, and coming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">close up to me, and then going ever so far off, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coming back. It's nothing to be afraid of, but some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how it simply paralyzes me with terror in my sle&lt;ip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Queer things--dreams. I know it's a dreain all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time, and I can't wake up from it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's probably only fancy," said Perera. "Den</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my niggers say Porroh men can send snakes. Seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any snakes lately?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Only one. I killed him this morning, on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floor near my hammock. Almost trod on him as I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">got up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ah!" said Perera, and then, reassuringly, "Of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course it is a--coincidence. Still, I would keep my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes open. Den dere's pains in de bones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I thought they were due to miasma," said Pollock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Probably dey are. When did dey begin ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Pollock remembered that lie first noticed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them the night after the fight in the hut. "It's my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opinion he don't want to kill you," said Perera--"at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">least not yet. I've heard deir idea is to scare and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worry a man wid deir spells, and narrow misses, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rheumatic pains, and bad dreams, and all dat, until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he's sick of life. Of course, it's all talk, you know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You mustn't worry about it. . . . But I wonder what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he'll be up to next."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I shall have to be up to something first," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock, staring gloomily at the greasy cards that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Perera was putting on the table. "It don't suit my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dignity to be followed about, and shot at, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blighted in this way. I wonder if Porroh hokey-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pokey upsets your luck at cards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He looked at Perera suspiciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Very likely it does," said Perera warmly, shuf-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fling. "Dey are wonderful people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That afternoon Pollock killed two snakes in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hammock, and there was also an extraordinary in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crease in the number of red ants that swarmed over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the place; and these annoyances put him in a fit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">temper to talk over business with a certain Mendi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rough lie had interviewed before. The Mendi rough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showed Pollock a little iron dagger, and demon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strated where one struck in the neck, in a way that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made Pollock shiver, and in return for certain con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">siderations Pollock promised him a double-barrelled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gun with an ornamental lock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the evening, as Pollock and Perera were play-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing cards, the Mendi rough came in through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doorway carrying something jn a blood-soaked piece</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of native cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not here!" said Pollock very hurriedly. "Not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But he was not quick enough to prevent the man,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who was anxious to get to Pollock's side of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bargain, from opening the cloth and throwing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head o f the Porroh man upon the table. It bounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from there on to the floor, leaving a red trail on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1075</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cards, and rolled into a corner, where it came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to rest upside down, but glaring hard at Pollock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Perera jumped up as the thing fell among the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cards, and began in his excitement to gabble in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese. The Mendi was bowing, with the red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cloth in his hand. "De gun!" he said.' Pollock stared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back at the head in the corner. It bore exactly the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expression it had in his dreams. Something seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to snap in his own brain as he looked at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Perera found his English again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "You got him killed?" he said. "You did not kill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Why should I ?" said Pollock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "But he will not be able to take it off now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Take what off?" said Pollock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "And all dese cards are spoiled!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  'What do you mean by taking off?" said Pollock,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'tou must send me a new pack from Freetown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You can buy dem dere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But--'take it off?"'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It is only superstition. I forgot. De niggers say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dat if de witches--he was a witch-- But it is rubbish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. . . You must make de Porroh man take it off, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kill him yourself. ... It is very silly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Pollock swore under his breath, still staring hard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the head in the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I can't stand that glare," he said. Then sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">denly he rushed at the thing and kicked it. It rolled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some yards or so, and came to rest in the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">position as before, upside down, and looking at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He is ugly," said the Anglo-Portuguese. "Very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ugly. Dey do it on deir faces with little knives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock would have kicked the head again, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Mendi man touched him on the arm. "De gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he said, looking nervously at the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Two--if you will take that beastly thing away,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said Pollock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I he Mendi shook his head, and intimated that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he only wanted one gun now due to him, and for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he would be obliged. Pollock found neither</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cajolery nor bullying any good with him. Perera</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a gun to sell (at a profit of three hundred per</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cent), and with that the man presently departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then Pollock's eyes, against his will, were "recalled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the thing 011 the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is funny dat his head keeps upside down,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said Perera. with an Uneasy laugh. "His brains must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be heavy, like de weight in de little images one sees</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dat keep always upright wid lead in dem. You will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">take him wiv you when you go presently. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might take him now. De cards are all spoilt. Dere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a man sell dem in Freetown. De room is in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">filthy mess as it is. You should have killed him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">POLLOCK pulled himself together, and went and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the head. He would hang it up by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp-hook in the middle of the ceiling of his room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dig a grave for it at once. He was under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression that he hung it up by the hair, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been wrong, for when he returned for it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was hanging by-the neck upside down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He buried it before sunset on the north side of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the shed he occupied, so that he should not have to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pass the grave after dark when he was returning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from Perera's. He killed two snakes before he went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to sleep. In the darkest part of the night he awoke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a start, and heard a pattering sound and some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing scraping on the floor. He sat up noiselessly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and felt under his pillow for his revolver. A mum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1076	AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bling growl followed, and Pollock fired at the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a yelp, and something dark passed for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a moment across the hazy blue of the doorway. "A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dog!" said Pollock, lying down again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the early dawn he awoke again with a peculiar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sense of unrest. The vague pain in his bones had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">returned. For some time he lay watching the red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants that were swarming over the ceiling, and then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as the light grew brighter, he looked over the edge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his hammock and saw something dark on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floor. He gave such a violent start that the ham-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mock overset and flung him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1-Ie found himself lying, perhaps, a yard away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the head of the Porroh man. It had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disinterred by the dog, and the nose was grievously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">battered. Ants and flies swarmed over it. By an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">odd coincidence, it was still upside down, aftd with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the same diabolical expression in the inverted eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pollock sat paralyzed, and stared at the horror for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some time. Then he got up and walked round it---</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">giving it a wide berth--and out of the shed. 1 he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clear light of the sunrise, the living stir of vegeta-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion before the breath of the dying land-breeze, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the empty grave with the marks of the dog's paws,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lightened the weight upon his mind a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He told Perera of the business as though it was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jest--a jest to be told with white lips. "You should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not have frighten de dog," said Perera, with poorly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">simulated hilarity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next two days, until the steamer came, were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spent by Pollock in making a more effectual disposi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of his possession. Overcoming his aversion to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">handling the thing, he went down to the river mouth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and threw it into the sea-water, but by some miracle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it escaped the crocodiles, and was cast up by the tide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on tlie mud a little way up the river, to be found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by an intelligent Arab half-breed, and offered for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sale to Pollock and Perera as a curiosity, just on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">edge of night. The native hung about in the brief</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twilight, making lower and lower offers, and at last,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">getting scared in some way by the evident dread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these wise white men had for the thing, went off,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and, passing Pollock's shed, threw his burden in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there for Pollock to discover in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At this Pollock got into a kind of frenzy. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would burn the thing. He went out straightway</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the dawn, and had constructed a big pyre of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brushwood before the heat of the day. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interrupted by the hooter of the little paddle steamer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from Monrovia to Bathurst, which was coming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the gap in the bar. "Thank heaven!" said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock, with infinite piety, when the meaning of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sound dawned upon him. With trembling hands he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lit his pile of wood hastily, threw the head upon it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and went away to pack his portmanteau and make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his adieus to Perera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That afternoon, with a sense of infinite relief,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock watched the flat swampy foreshore of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sulyma grow small in the distance. The gap in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the long line of white surge became narrower and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">narrower. It seemed to be closing in and cutting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him off from his trouble. The feeling of dread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and worry began to slip from him bit by bit. At</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sulyma belief in Porroh malignity and Porroh magic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been in the air, his sense of Porroh had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vast, pervading, threatening, dreadful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now manifestly the domain of Porroh was only a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little place, a little black band between the sea and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blue cloudy Mendi uplands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-bye, Porroh!" said Pollock. "Good-bye--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">certainly not an revoir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain of the steamer came and leant over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rail beside him, and wished him good-evening,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and spat at the froth of the wake in token of friendly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I picked up a rummy curio on the beach this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go," said the captain. "It's a thing I never saw done</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this side of Indy before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What might that be?" said Pollock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Pickled 'ed," said the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" said Pollock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Ed--smoked. 'Ed of one of these Porroh</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaps, all ornamented with knife-cuts. Why!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's up? Nothing? I shouldn't have took you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a nervous chap. Green in the face. By gosh!</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're a bad sailor. All right, eh? Lord, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny you went! . . . Well, this 'ed I was telling you</seg><seg type="columnLine">of is a bit rum in a way. I've got it, along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some snakes, in a jar of spirit in my cabin what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeps for such curios, and I'm hanged if it don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">float upsy down. Hallo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pollock had given an incoherent cry, and had his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands in his'hair. He ran towards the paddle-boxes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a half-formed idea of jumping into the sea, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then he realized his position and turned back towards</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here!" said the captain. "Jack Philips, just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">keep him off me! Stand off! No nearer, mister!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What's the matter with you? Are you mad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pollock put his hand to his head. It was no good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">explaining. "I believe I am pretty nearly mad at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">times," he said. "It's a pain I have here. Comes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. You'll excuse me, I hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was white and in a perspiration. He saw sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">denly very clearly all the danger he ran of having</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his sanity doubted. He forced himself to restore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the captain's confidence, by answering his sympa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thetic inquiries, noting his suggestions, even trying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a spoonful of neat brandy in his cheek, and, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">matter settled, asking a number of questions about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the captain's private trade in curiosities. The cap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain described the head in detail. All the while Pol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lock was struggling to keep under a preposterous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">persuasion that the ship was as transparent as glass,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and that he could distinctly see the inverted face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looking at him from the cabin beneath his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pollock had a worse time almost on the steamer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than he had at Sulyma. All day he had to control</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself, in spite of his intense perception of the im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minent presence of that horrible head that was over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shadowing his mind. At night his old nightmare</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">returned, until, with a violent effort, he would force</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself awake, rigid with the horror of it, and with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ghost of a hoarse scream in his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left the actual head behind at Bathurst, where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he changed ship for Teneriffe, but not his dreams</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nor the dull ache in his bones. At Teneriffe, Pol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lock transferred to a Cape liner, but the head fol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lowed him. He gambled, he tried chess,_ he even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">read books, but he knew the danger of drink. Y et</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whenever a round black shadow, a round black ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ject came into his range, there he looked for the head,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and--saw it. He knew clearly enough that his im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">agination was growing traitor to him, and yet at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">times it seemed the ship he sailed in, his fellow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passengers, the sailors, the wide sea, was all part of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a filmy phantasmagoria that hung, scarcely veiling it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">between him and a horrible real world. Then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Porroh man, thrusting his diabolical face through</seg><seg type="columnLine">POLLOCK AND THE PORROH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1077</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that curtain, was the one real and undeniable thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At that he would get up and touch things, taste some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing, gnaw something, burn his hand with a match,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or run a needle into himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO, struggling grimly and silently with his excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination, Pollock reached England. He landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Southampton, and went on straight from Water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loo* to his banker's in Cornhill in a cab. There he</seg><seg type="columnLine">transacted some business with the manager in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private room, and all the while the head hung like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ornament under the black marble mantel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripped upon the fender. He could hear the drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall, and see the red on the fender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A pretty fern," said the manager, following his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "But it makes the fender rusty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very," said Pollock; "a very pretty fern' And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reminds me. Can you recommend me a physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cian for mind troubles? I've got a little--what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it ?--hallucination."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The head laughed savagely, wildly. Pollock was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised the manager did not notice it. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager only stared at his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the address of a doctor, Pollock presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged in Cornhill. There was no cab in sight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he went on down, to the western end of the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and essayed the crossing opposite the Mansion</seg><seg type="columnLine">House. The crossing is hardly easy even for the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pert Londoner; cabs, vans, carriages, mail-carts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">omnibuses go by in one incessant stream; to any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh from the malarious solitudes of Sierra Leone</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a boiling, maddening confusion. But when an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inverted head suddenly comes bouncing, like an india</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber ball, between your legs, leaving distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">smears of blood every time it touches the ground, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can scarcely hope to avoid an accident. Pollock</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his feet convulsively to avoid it, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked at the thing furiously. Then something hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">him violently in the back, and a hot pain ran up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been hit by the pole of an omnibus, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three fingers of his left hand were smashed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoof of one of the horses--the very fingers, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, that he shot from the Porroh man. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled him out from between the horses' legs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the address of the physician in his crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a couple of days Pollock's sensations were full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sweet, pungent smell of chloroform, of painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations that caused him no pain, of lying still and</seg><seg type="columnLine">being given food and drink. Then he had a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever, and was very thirsty, and his old nightmare</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back. It was only when it returned, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed it had left him for a day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If my skull had been smashed instead of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers, it might have gone altogether," said Pollock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring thoughtfully at the dark cushion that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on for the time the shape of the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pollock at the first opportunity told the physician</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mind trouble. He knew clearly that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go mad unless something should intervene to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He explained that he had witnessed a decapi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation in Dahomey, and was haunted by one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. Naturally, he did not care to state the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts. The physician looked grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he spoke hesitatingly. "As a child, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get very much religious training?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Very little," said Pollock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> * One of the great London railroad termini.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A shade passed over the physician's face. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know if you have heard of the miraculous cures--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be, of course, they are not miraculous--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lourdes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Faith-healing will hardly suit me, I am afraid,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Pollock, with his eye on the dark cushion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The head distorted its scarred features in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abominable grimace. The physician went upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new track. "It's all imagination," he said, speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sudden briskness.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning Professor Banning came into the workshop</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a common wooden bucket tilted at a rakish</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle on his venerable head. He looked so comical</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was with the greatest difficulty that I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed an inclination to giggle. But the high respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had always felt toward him forced me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep my face straight. I fancied I saw him casting</seg><seg type="columnLine">surreptitious glances in my direction, as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to catch me grinning, but not a flicker of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile did I dare venture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he spoke. "I suppose you want to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I'm wearing this bucket. Maybe you think I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy; but 'if this be madness, there's method in't'</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our mutual inspiration, the Bard of Avon, puts it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hardest thing I have to encounter in working</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the -formulas for these hecatonicosiahedragons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other polyhedragons is that I have to carry so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many figures and symbols in my head. That, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, would be easy enough if it were not for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other figures and symbols which do not belong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which come into my head from outside,--thus mix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up my formulas. 1 recently discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these extraneous figures cannot penetrate wood. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I have to do is keep this bucket over my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the figures outside cannot get in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of these days I'll have to borrow your</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket," I jested. "Not to keep the outside figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">from coming in, however. For, when I finally man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age to get one of your formulas inside my noodle, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel as if I need a bucket or something thicker,--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent the symbols that are inside from getting out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if, as you say, the figures can't get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood, perhaps I'm already protected."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed to tickle the Professor. He was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">constrained to pay me a compliment--something ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely rare for him. He put his hand on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and said, "My boy, there's nothing radically</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong with your head. At any rate, it isn't swelled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that's something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see how anyone could get swell-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his thinking capacity when he's working with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real thinker like you," I came back at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, my boy: but I'm afraid my mind isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">working so well today. This old carcass is pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well worn out. Those pains have been bothering me</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. I think I'll knock off for today. Can you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">along without me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">1084</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I told him that, so far as his part was concerned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hyper-Forceps was practically finished. It only</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked certain finishing touches which were purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical' in character and which I felt certain I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could work out alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that day, Professor Banning failed rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in health. It was as if the excitement of striving for</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement, which, like a powerful electric current</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept him going through months of gruelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain, was suddenly snapped off--leaving only his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble old body to fight the ravages of age and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing the necessity for speed, I worked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">merciless haste, carrying my labors far into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning hours and grudgingly taking but an hour or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two each day for sleep and a bite of food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the Hyper-Forceps was finished. *Jn gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral outlines it was not unlike an ordinary medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">forceps, except that it had a rough appearance, due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the thousands of small solids with which it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded. For instance, the portions that one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to be cylindrical in shape were made up of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small spheres which I have previously described, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surfaces resembled those of a raspberry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The really distinctive feature of the Hyper-For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceps was that it had four finger-holes or handles like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of a pair of scissors. There was only one pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jaws, however, and they could be operated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">either set of handles, working independently or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison. When the two sets of handles were kept to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, the device worked exactly like an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">three dimensional forceps. But when the right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of handles was separated from the left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair, it operated a unique mechanism by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the jaws were made to move at right angles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the three dimensions of ordinary space--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words, through the fourth dimension. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been all figured out theoretically with such pains-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking care that I felt absolutely certain it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">work--though I, myself, during all my work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimentation, had never attempted the crucial</seg><seg type="columnLine">test.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had been agreed between us that Doctor Mayer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be the first one to operate the Hyper-Forceps</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the fourth dimension, and I was perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">content to concede that honor to him. Though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as strong and rigid as a similar article occupy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only three dimensions, I handled the Hyper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forceps as carefully as if it were a beaker of thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass filled to the brim with nitro-glycerine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took it immediately to Professor Banning's room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told the nurse to notify Doctor Mayer "that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four dimensional forceps was finished. He had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed an important operation and he still wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surgeon's cap and frock when he entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor's room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was decided to put the Hyper-Forceps to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">test right then and there. An inanimate object was</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected for the first trial. Doctor Mayer picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a medicine bottle from the table by the bed, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the cork and poured the contents into the wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">basin. He then took from his pocket a lead pencil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked off the small rubber eraser, dropped it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottle and replaced the stopper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall attempt to take that rubber from inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottle without removing the cork," he explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He placed the bottle on the table and reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hyper-Forceps, which I handed him. Inserting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tips of his right thumb and forefinger in one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of handles, and those of his left hand in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other pair, he slowly manipulated the unique mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism which we had devised for converting motion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">three dimensional space into a corresponding move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at right angles to each of the three dimensions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PREPARED as I was for something preposterous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to happen, I was dumfounded to see the Hyper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forceps, part by part, melt into nothingness and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear from sight until only the handles were visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guiding the instrument entirely by guess work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doctor moved it until he estimated that the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible jaws ought to be somewhere inside the bottle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he brought the two sets of handles together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As if by some weird magic the jaws of the forceps</seg><seg type="columnLine">became visible within the bottle, but. they seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be suspended in space, with 110 apparent connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them and the handles. It was a simple mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter to work the handles until the jaws grasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eraser. By separating the two sets of handles again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doctor caused the rubber to disappear com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely, after which he pulled the handles away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottle and once more brought the handles to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. Within a few seconds, the eraser had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted right through the solid walls of the bottle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been dropped on the table!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It works! It works! It works!" the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept repeating in a shrill tone of voice. He arose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started jumping up and down on the bed, cutting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very grotesque figure in his outing flannel night shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Mayer, too, was abnormally excited. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped his hands together and cried, "Oh boy!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a kid who has just received his first air rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until afterward that I gave any thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the incongruity of their behavior in comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my own. I, a callow youth, forty years younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the Professor and fully twenty-five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger than the Doctor was as cool and calm as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Eskimo, while these two dignified and mature</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were cavorting around like a couple of first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you operate on me right away?" was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor's first thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why ? Are you in very great pain ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. In fact, the pain seems to have left me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I just can't wait for you to try out the Hyper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forceps on me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless it's a matter of life and death, I'd rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it through some more tests, and incidentally get</seg><seg type="columnLine">more practice in using it before I attempt to operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">on you," was the Doctor's sensible suggestion. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next thing I'd like to try is removing some object I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't see, like the inside of a nut."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would a peanut do ?" I asked. Perhaps I ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain that I have a weakness for "goobers" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a few in my pocket, left over from a bag I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">purchased that noon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just the thing!" exclaimed the Doctor, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed one of the nuts to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the Hyper-Forceps was brought into play.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took a little longer to accomplish the purpose this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, as it was necessary for Doctor Mayer to grope</seg><seg type="columnLine">around until he felt the kernel within the grip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws. But he finally got hold of each of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">kernels in turn and dropped them on the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like "doubting Thomas" of the Scriptures, I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite satisfied until I had made a personal investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, lifted the shell, still perfectly intact, and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">it near my ear. Not a ghost of a rattle could I hear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUR DIMENSIONAL SURGERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1085</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lightness of the nut was further proof that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amazing feat of removing the kernels without</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking the shell had been accomplished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now for a trial on a living creature," cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor. "Let's go to my private laboratory. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I have a good subject to experiment on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Banning donned his bathrobe and slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers, and the three of us went to the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Mayer's "subject" turned out to be "Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">helm," a Toggenberg goat, which he had procured</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a subject for some medical experiments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's an opportunity to see whether the popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">jokes about the alleged cosmopolitan character of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goat's diet are founded on fact," he jested. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, I think I'll use my X-ray goggles. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them, of course?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We both shook our heads.	v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's not much to them. Same principle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluorescent screens, but made in the form of goggles</seg><seg type="columnLine">for convenience. I use them in connection with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">specially designed operating table. You see, it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Roentgen tube arranged in such a way that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">throws the X-rays right through the body of anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on the table."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted Wilhelm to the table and strapped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. Then he threw the switch that operated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-ray apparatus and adjusted the goggles to his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In order that we might get the full benefit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment, he provided each of us with fluorescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">goggles.	_	. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That the goat had some foreign substances in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach was instantly apparent. Doctor Mayer</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the Hyper-Forceps and worked the han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dles. Again the instrument, except for the handles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded from sight. This time, Doctor Mayer seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have considerable difficulty in placing the jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he wanted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Odd!" he exclaimed. "Most peculiar feeling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like pushing something against some yielding sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance or against a strong current of air or water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See, in this direction it moves easily; but I have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use all my strength to make it move in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction." So absorbed were we in the experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself that we made no attempt to explain this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable phenomenon just at that time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By exercising the utmost care, accompanied by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenditure of considerable elbow grease, the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally succeeded in forcing the Hyper-Forceps into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the position he desired. Then he brought the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sets of handles together, making the jaws of the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceps appear inside the goat's stomach. Then, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one, he removed the following objects: An iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt, three shingle nails, a tire valve cap, a boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble and two safety pins. Through it all, Wilhelm</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept up an incessant, "Ma-a-ah! Ma-a-ah! Ma-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ah!" but did not seem in the least bit distressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the moments when the four dimensional for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceps was exploring his internal workings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that ought to be proof enough that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">works," Professor Banning remarked. "The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that remains now is to try it on my gall-stones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I move that we do it right, now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Mayer seemed equally anxious to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final test. "All right," he assented, "but first let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">send for my brother. Though I don't expect any</seg><seg type="columnLine">complications it may be best to have another surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">present."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Julius Mayer responded promptly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, of course, heard all about the four dimensional</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forceps from his brother, and it took but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments to explain the device to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't be necessary to make any special prep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arations, will it?" asked the patient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't see the need of it, except that I shall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course sterilize the Hyper-Forceps. You might get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a can of ether handy, Julius, to use in case some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing unforeseen happens. But, judging from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that goat behaved, I'm sure we won't have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cl.AD just as he was, in nightgown and bathrobe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Banning stretched himself out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating table. Doctor Paul Mayer turned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-ray and adjusted the fluorescent goggles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he started to manipulate the Hyper-Forceps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he again remarked about the difficulty he experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in forcing it to move in certain directions and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease with which it moved in other directions. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, he finally succeeded in introducing the jaws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forceps into the patient's body, where we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly see them with the aid of our X-ray goggles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After several trials, he placed the jaws of the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment inside the gall bladder, where the offending</seg><seg type="columnLine">gall stones could be dimly discerned. All this time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor was fully conscious of what was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feel any pain?" the surgeon asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not a bit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any unusual or peculiar sensation?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet. Ouch! I did that time! It didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt very much, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I just pinched your liver a trifle," the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then, a horrifying thing happened. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Professor Banning's body, made faintly visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble by means of the X-ray, seemed suddenly to melt</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. A few seconds later his ribs faded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. At the same instant, Doctor Paul Mayer gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterance to an agonizing cry, "My God! There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">something pulling against me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I jerked off the goggles and dashed to his side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaiming, "Can't I help you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. Better keep away! Good heavens! Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my arms!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My blood almost congealed at the unspeakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight! His arms seemed cut off at the elbows! His</seg><seg type="columnLine">forearms and hands had disappeared completely, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so had the handles of the Hyper-Forceps!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took another horrified glance at Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banning's body just in time to see it fade completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from view!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time, all of Doctor Mayer's arms and part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his chest had "melted" from sight. His brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed to him and grasped him around the waist as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to draw him back to safety. He might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried to hold a wisp of smoke. The last words</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard from Paul Mayer were, "For God's sake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me go!" With a moan of despair, his brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">released his hold. A moment later, not a vestige of</seg><seg type="columnLine">either Doctor Paul Mayer, Professor Banning or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hyper-Forceps remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Julius Mayer and I stood looking at each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of us transfixed with horror. In his face, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw reflected all those emotions and sensations which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were racking my own body and brain:--grief, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity, awe, and--overshadowing all else--a ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness of stark fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1086</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was the first to speak: "My God, what shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps we'd better notify the police," I stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Heavens!

At the end of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, we had to admit our helplessness. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand the feelings of a naval officer who knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many fathoms beneath the keel of his ship there</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc thirty gallant men slowly dying horrible deaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the belly of a disabled submarine and yet is utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerless to do anything to help them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hopeless in his despair, Julius Mayer finally said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose there is nothing to do now but notify the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police. I'm afraid that we are going to have a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">time explaining how my brother and Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banning disappeared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if I'm to be put through the third degree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose 1 may as well change my clothes." I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still wearing the overalls and work shirt which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my customary apparel while laboring at my mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical tasks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving Julius Mayer to take care of the form-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ality of notifying the authorities, I went to the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop, where my street clothes were hanging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I entered the room where Professor Banning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had worked together for so many eventful</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, I had a strangely weird feeling of dread--</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as a superstitious person might experience on</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming unexpectedly into a graveyard. I expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rienced a mysterous consciousness that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody present who could not be seen or heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then my attention was arrested by a most as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounding phenomenon. A drop light, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been installed to enable us to work at night, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">behaving in an amazing manner. The cord was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn to one side until it was almost horizontal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the globe and shade apparently supported in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space in utter defiance of the law of gravitation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My eye, searching for an explanation of this mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acle, suddenly encountered something which I recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized instantly as the jaws of the Hyper-Forceps!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I was scared before, I was thoroughly terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken now. I could feel the goose flesh rising all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my body and my hair began to bristle, "like</seg><seg type="columnLine">quills upon the fretful porcupine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first impulse was a cowardly one--undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly prompted by the universal but sometimes das-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tardly instinct of self-preservation. I wanted to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">run away--to call help--to let someone else take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk of rescuing those two men whom I now knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be hanging out there in hyper-space with nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but two flimsy strands of electric wire holding them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just what made me stay, I am not sure, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it must have been the genuine love with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had learned to regard Professor Banning. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">many ways he had treated me as a father would</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat his son, and to me, who had never enjoyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefits of a parent's care, this had meant a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That quick action was imperative, and that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no time to go for help, was immediately appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent. The cord was manifestly under a greater strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">than'it could be expected to bear very long, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard an ominous crack which told me that one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screws holding the fixture to the ceiling had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come loosened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one who never made any claims to strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">or courage, it took a heap of nerve to do what I did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could easily imagine just how Lindbergh felt when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped into the cockpit of the "Spirit of Saint</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis" and hopped off across the storm-tossed sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not knowing whether he would ever come out alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How was I to know what frightful fate might take</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of me the moment I grasped the jaws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hyper-Forceps? Would it be possible for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw these two men back to earth, or would my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own body be sucked into eternity, just as the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Doctor Mayer had been pulled away before my</seg><seg type="columnLine">very eyes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever was to be the outcome, there seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be nothing else to do, so I leaped on the work bench,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Was just high enough to enable me to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaws of the Hyper-Forceps. I had presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind enough to brace myself by a tight grip with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand on the framework of a large machine drill</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I reached w^ith my other hand for the Hyper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forceps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as I grasped it, the last of the screws holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light fixture gave way, and with a jerk that al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most pulled my arm out of its socket, the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain was shifted to my body. I managed to hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, however, and in a little while the stress was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what relieved. It felt like holding the string of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big kite in a strong wind--just a steady, powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">but yielding tug. 1 found that by exerting myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was able to pull against the force that was resisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Gradually, more and more of the Hyper-For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceps came into view until it was entirely visible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though I had fully anticipated what was to happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">next, it seemed almost too preposterous to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I perceived a detached human hand clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the handle of the Hyper-Forceps and apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended in midair. As I slowly drew it toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, first the right arm, then the torso and legs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally the head of Doctor Mayer loomed into view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His left arm, except for a small part close to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, was still invisible, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time, Doctor Mayer was able to help him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self by hooking one foot in a vise which was fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bench, and with this extra bracing added to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tugging on the Hyper-Forceps, we quickly suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in drawing into the room the body of Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Banning whom the doctor had been holding by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You can easily imagine the relief which they felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">at being snatched from a horrible fate, and you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUR DIMENSIONAL SURGERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1087</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">also picture the joy with which I welcomed back these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two travelers into the mystic realms of hyper-space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a typical youngster, I plied Professor Banning</seg><seg type="columnLine">with questions, which he undertook to answer some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what as follows: "As nearly as I can figure out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of the Hyper-Forceps which extended into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth dimension must have been caught in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">current of cosmic force which was strong enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw the entire instrument out of three dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, pulling Doctor Mayer and myself with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally, it will take me some time to work out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a truly scientific explanation, but there were certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">indications which led me to believe that as soon as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared from your sight we began to lose our</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational attraction for the earth. I put it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way because, as you doubtless know, every object on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe attracts the earth itself just as trulyvas the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth attracts it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Being projected into the fourth dimension had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of relieving us from some of the gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional attraction of the earth, but our bodies still</seg><seg type="columnLine">had momentum enough to carry us along with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Of course we did not lose all our gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional attraction for the earth, but only a portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Had we lost all, we would have been shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space by centrifugal force, like rocks shot from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sling. Perhaps our position might be likened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a piece of iron which is moved from in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a magnet to one side of it, so that the lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">force extended at a changed angle and with a dimin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After a few moments we noticed that we seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be slowly drifting away from the place where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">originally left three dimensional space. I account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this by the assumption that our momentum was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being slightly decreased while 'the motion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth was continuing at the same rate of speed. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies passed easily right through the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital building. Though everything was plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible to us as we floared along, we found that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts to grasp or hold any three dimensional objects</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were fruitless. They melted in our fingers like so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much vapor. Our bodies also seemed almost trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent and I found that I could easily stick my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">right through my own chest without any discomfort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time, I found that when I grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Mayer's hand, in order to prevent us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being separated, I was able to hold it and to stay close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him without being able to feel any sensation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact. With his other hand, Doctor Mayer still</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to the Hyper-Forceps. It was a good thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did hang to it, because without its help we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have been able to get back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a little while we found ourselves floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the workshop. I quickly realized that if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to drift in this manner we would soon be</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hanging in space with the earth hurtling away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us at a terrific speed. It was then that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of using the Hyper-Forceps as a means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting back. Acting on my instructions, Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayer grasped with the Hyper-Forceps the first ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject he could reach. It happened to be that light-cord.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was lucky you came in when you did, because it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed impossible for as to pull ourselves back</seg><seg type="columnLine">without help. Please bear in mind that this explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is purely superficial and there may be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaws in it which I shall have to correct later when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have had an opportunity to go more deeply into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientific aspects of the subject.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exact nature of this invention was as yet in doubt,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but it was much discussed, and everyone had his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ideas on the matter. It may seem strange to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reader that the professor himself was not asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about his invention, but he was a very grouchy in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dividual who was hated by the students, whom in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turn he cordially disliked. At this time I was tak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing a course in physics which was required for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">completion of my course. It was a subject that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">always interested me, and as I showed ascertain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aptitude for this branch of science, the prbfessor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave me the benefit of his special attention. I do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not mean to imply by this that he was fond of me;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he simply seemed to like me more than he did the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In spite of the fact that I was his favorite, it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a great surprise when Professor Wild called me up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at my home during the following vacation, and asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me to come over to his house immediately, as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a matter of great importance to communicate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Instantly, I scrambled into my coat and made a rush</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for his residence, which was only a short distance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away. I arrived in a few minutes, out of breath and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">keyed up to the highest pitch of excitement. I rang</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bell and the professor opened the door. I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">surprised to see that his countenance, which habitu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ally wore a sullen expression, fairly beamed with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">triumphant smiles. However, I was left little time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for contemplation, for he led me upstairs to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laboratory at once and showed me the great secret</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he had hitherto so jealously guarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What I saw was a very large and elongated X-ray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tube attached to a mercury exhaust pump. It stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upright and at the bottom was a small iron crucible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">containing a silvery liquid which I supposed was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mercury. Connected with the apparatus was a cable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which led to a box at an end of the table on which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tube rested. On one side of the box was a dial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which gave it the general</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appearance of a radio set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Having seen this much, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned to the professor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for an explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware," he began, "that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my recent work at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">college has had to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure of the atom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">All my labors tended</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a goal. This goal was the disintegration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atom. My ambition is realized in the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you see here. The disintegration is accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the action of a stream of electrons vibrating at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exceedingly high frequency. Before I go any</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, it might be just as well to review your</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the structure of the atom so that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may better understand my invention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "An atom, as you should know, is composed of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two essential parts. First, a nucleus' which is prin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cipally a positive charge of electricity, called a proton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Second, a certain number of negative charges, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">electrons, most of which revolve around the proton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at a high rate of speed. Now the imoortant fact for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you to bear in mind is that one atom differs from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another only in the number of electrons it contains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When an atom has many electrons, it has a high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">atomic weight; when there are few electrons, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">atomic weight is low. Now the interesting thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about it is, that when all of the elements are ar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ranged in- the order of their increasing atomic'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weights, each element has one more electron in one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of its atoms than the one before it. This number</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of electrons is called the atomic number. For in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stance, silver has an atom of forty-seven electrons,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so it has an atomic number of forty-seven. From</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all this we see that the nature of an element rests</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">solely on the number of electrons in any of its atoms,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so that if in any way we can alter this number, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can change its identity. After a great deal of ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perimenting, I found that this could be accomplished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by subjecting the substance in question to the action</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of my high frequency ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I thought by this time that the lecture must be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over, but it was nothing to that which followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Having taken a course in physics," he continued,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"you should be familiar with radioactivity and alpha,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">delta, and gamma rays. Of these the alpha ray is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the weakest and least penetrating, while the gamma</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ray is strongest and will penetrate one foot of iron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Also, these rays differ from each other in their com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">positions. The alpha ray is a stream of positively</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">charged helium ions, the beta rays are simply a flow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of electrons moving at a high velocity, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gamma rays are waves in ether. The X-ray is simi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lar to the gamma ray, but is not nearly so pene-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trating. Now to explain my machine: First of all,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had an X-ray tube of special construction made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for this experiment. In this tube I produce an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">X-ray of an infinitely greater frequency than the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ordinary one. If you look carefully, you will see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two extra electrodes sealed into the glass. A current</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with high voltage is made to go across the gap be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tween them. This results in an electrical discharge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like the one in a Geissler tube, as they both consist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a high frequency discharge in a vacuum. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">discharge, or stream of electrons, goes before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">X-ray. The electrons are swept from their path by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ray and movd along with it, and at the same time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a high vibratory rate is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imparted to them, so what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we have now is a sort of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">super beta ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I asked, "I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under the impression that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an X-ray tube did have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two electrodes across which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed a high tension cur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rent under high potential."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well," he answered, "it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has but this ray is known as the cathode ray. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">X-ray is caused by the impact of this cathode ray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on some substance in its path called an anticathode.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The X-ray is famous for its ability to penetrate some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">organic substances, but my ray will penetrate any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">substance, organic or inorganic, and more than that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it is of so high a frequency that it will penetrate an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">atom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The professor having made this amazing declara-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, drew himself up to his full height and regarded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me triumphantly. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What do you think of it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's great! But I fail to see what relation it bears</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the structure of the atom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">TJjfERE is a short story of the atom, which will be of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">J- -* more than passing interest to you. Science teaches</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us that all materials, no matter what they are, are essen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tially of the same substances, with the exception, that a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">piece of metal, for instance, has more electrons than the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gas hydrogen; otherwise, the two substances arc the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This fact has inspired The Disintegrating Ray, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gives you a good deal of instruction in a palatable manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1090	AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You see," said the professor, "that my ray, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from now on I will refer to as the epsilon ray, is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">composed of a stream of electrons vibrating at'a high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">frequency. When this ray is directed toward a sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stance, it penetrates each atom. The electrons^ of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ray meet the electrons in the atom and there is a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">collision, which results in the atom losing some of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its electrons. This loss changes the identity of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">substance. After several months of experimenting,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I found that the strength of the epsilon ray depends</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entirely on the voltage of the secondary discharge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now I have it regulated so that the ray will remove</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just one electron per second. I have also discovered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another interesting fact, namely, that iron is not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">affected by my ray. I am not sure just why this is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so, but I think it is due to the fact that the magnetic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flux set up within the metal counteracts the a,ction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the epsilon ray. Consequently, I can tak&lt;* the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heaviest element known to exist on the earth, urani-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">um, and reduce it to iron. Then I can take the ele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment with an atomic number just below that of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">iron, the metal manganese, and reduce it to hydro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gen, but I cannot reduce uranium directly to hydro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gen. In a way, this is an advantage, for I can make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the apparatus that will be exposed to the ray out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">iron; almost any other substance would be disin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tegrated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What,".I asked, "is the purpose of the pump?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That," he explained, "is to extract the air, other-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wise it would disintegrate when I turned on the ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You said that the epsilon ray was of an excep-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tionally high frequency?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, yes! Extremely so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How is this accomplished?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, that is a little invention of my own. I use</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a radio tube specially connected with a coil system in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which there is a set of coils, each of a higher induct-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ance than the one before it. I cannot give you the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">details now, as it is not yet perfected. The whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is kept in that box with the dial. That dial, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rather the switch that it controls, is another inven-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of mine made for the machine. It is really a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sort of time switch which controls the length of time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the machine is in action. As I said before, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ray will take off one electron per second. If you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will notice, the dial is numbered. The numbers re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fer to seconds and when I wish to reduce a sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stance to another element of a lower atomic weight,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I calculate the atomic numbers between them and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turn the dial to that number. At the center of the dial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a small button which starts the machine. When the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dial has been turned to the correct number, I press</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the button and the ray acts for the required time. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soon as it is over and the transmutation has pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceeded sufficiently, the instrument automatically stops</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ray and the action ceases. Now perhaps you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would like to see my machine in action ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I replied in the affirmative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Professor Wild walked over to the tube and made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some preliminary adjustments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now what shall I turn the mercury into?" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asked, turning to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Try gold," I suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right," agreed the professor, "the atomic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">number of gold is seventy-nine and that of mercury</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is eighty, so they are only separated by the differ-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ence of one electron; consequently, I turn the dial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the number one." The professor's hand went over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the switch, and with a loudly beating heart, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watched him close the circuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instantly the silvery liquid hardened and turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. Professor Wild disconnected the epsilon ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube from the pump, took out the gold and handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to me. As he did so, one of his peculiar smiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">overspread his face. I took the gold and examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It seemed to be pure, for it was very soft, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, in fact, that I could easily scratch with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger nail. When I took it, I noticed that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather warm, so I asked the professor the reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "When these electrons were put together, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done at the expense of a great deal of heat and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy. Now that I tear them apart, this heat is liber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated and leaves the element so it becomes cold. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the collision between the electrons that results when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turn on the ray causes a vast amount of heat which</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than equals the cold. Or, in other words, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">endothermic reaction in which heat is taken in or</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed from the collision, counteracts the exo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermic reaction in which heat is given off due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disintegration." For a few minutes I stood still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the contemplation of the wonderful machine*</seg><seg type="columnLine">when suddenly I had an idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Couldn't you prepare the undiscovered elements</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, but that idea occurred to me before, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done so already." He went to a nearby cabinet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned with a few bottles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You see," said the professor, "that they are only</seg><seg type="columnLine">some more metals of the rare earths, all of which are</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much alike." He submitted the bottles to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection and I saw that each contained a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitish metal that resembled aluminum. He again</seg><seg type="columnLine">went over to his cabinet and this time brought back</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lead casket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The contents of this box would have been worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">six or seven million dollars. Now it is worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately fifty dollars." He must have read my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, "Yes it is radium which I can now make at</seg><seg type="columnLine">will from uranium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "By the way, professor," I broke in, "is there any</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical use to which you can put this machine?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean could you possibly make it do anything and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be subject to your control?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Theoretically, it is possible, but the main diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty lies in the fact that once the sudden disintegra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is started, it will spread and the whole world</seg><seg type="columnLine">will cease to exist. So that you may better under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, let me liken the case to an immense pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunpowder. If you apply a spark to any point, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole will go off. But if some is separated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest and then is lit, it will not affect the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pile. Now, I cannot separate the substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I use from the rest of the world, but I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulate it in an iron sphere, which metal, as I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you, is not affected by the epsilon ray. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, there is another puzzle that confronts me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no way of knowing how much power I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">get from the particular substance I may use to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrate, so there is the danger of the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing up and wrecking the laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't see why there should be an explosion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To do so, you must first understand the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple of the thing. In the process of releasing atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, the atom is subjected to a powerful dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge, which instead of merely taking off a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons, completely blasts the atom to pieces so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all of the electrons are left flying around. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives rise to great pressure which can be used for</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DISINTEGRATING RAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">many things. It is this pressure that may cause the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion. Of course this is not the ideal way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting atomic energy, for this would cause a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of waste. The best thing to do would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy the atom in such a way that all of the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that originally went into its making would be avail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. However, that is only a dream at the best.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other is the only practical one that I can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now.

The probability that our supplies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anthracite coal and oil will only last for about one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years and fourteen years respectively, is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of grave concern, but with the key to atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy discovered, all of these fears will be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled.

So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to call on him, hoping in that way, to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of his methods. I expected to come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with a well trained mind. I was disappointed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next morning, when I found him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without asking me my errand, or even ascertain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my identity, Mrs. Kingston, a florid, pleasant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced woman of middle age, in a state of acute anxiety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to tell me that her husband had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come in from his laboratory at the usual hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous evening, and that she thought he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably taken a run down town for some neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary article and had been unavoidably delayed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He seldom goes out without me, but you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he gets submerged in one of his old in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventions he sometimes seems to forget he l?as me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said with a half whimsical smile. She had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sleepless night, after several trips to the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vain hope that he had left some note or clue</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to his whereabouts. During the night she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephoned the police in the city of which this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suburb, and had called up all the emergency hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitals, but to no purpose. Mr. Kingston's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother was already on his way by motor from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighboring town, and she was momentarily expect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the arrival of her mother, who was bringing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">police investigator from town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I offered my services, and asked where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory was located. She led me to the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the house past a group of outbuildings to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow of a very steep hill, overlooking a wide boule-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vard, and beyond, a recently staked allotment. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has it here to get the sun," she remarked, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended the steep declivity by a few primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">field-stone steps and entered the laboratory. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very roughly built, the roof being partly of glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no'floor. As we entered, we stepped into quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielding sand. I remember that it struck me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather singular that such a very steep hill could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of such unresisting sand. But immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately other things claimed my attention, and I per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that the place was fitted up very much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the research department in a modern factory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the foreground was an upright piece of appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus about the size of the usual dentist's X-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, but apparently containing quite a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hoppers, mixers and agitators. As I stopped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to regard this, my hostess turned about say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, "I am just going to take another look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidehill. It is so slippery this wet weather, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just possible that he-" I was left to finish the sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence for myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was alone, before this strange device. I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentary feeling that I was standing in a presence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On a rack before the machine stood a small alumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">num vat, full of r. translucent shimmering fluid, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of which floated some dozen or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">small discs, about the size of a lady's watch. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were prevented from coming in contact with the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vat by slender spines of chalk-like substance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">projecting from all the walls. I noticed that each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the discs had a large number printed on its broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. And with my mind more than half engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the speculation as to the whereabouts of Mr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingston, I took up one of the discs. It was rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">spongy, and surprisingly heavy; in color it resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very green apple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HARDLY had I lifted it from its insulating bath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I realized the danger and impropriety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a rash act, and essayed to lay it down again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even as I did so, I felt a spasmodic contraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the muscles of my fingers, and involuntarily I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped the disc in a crushing grasp. I looked wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for help. Whether I cried out or not, I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know. Then the objects in the room appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be rising up and growing taller, till with an indescrib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able sense of horror I perceived that I was shrinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in height and size. Then my sight commenced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blur, and I had a sensation as of descending in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">express elevator. I remember thinking, "This must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the sinking sensation which precedes death." Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">did this sensation prevail only under an anesthetic?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I thought "How could it be known what one</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences in dying, since none come back to tell ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually my mind ceased to function, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only conscious of a rapid falling motion, at times</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat retarded and at other times greatly ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celerated. This continued for what seenied a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I brought up with a mild jerk, and as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptions reasserted themselves, found myself sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended in the crotch of a low tree, with my feet just</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing the ground. As I was struggling to free</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, I saw a little man about twenty inches tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming hurriedly toward me. T decided to wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his help, which he gingerly offered by supporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet, and I had no difficulty in climbing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. It was then that I noticed that I was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than my rescuer. T thought, "This is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a temporary hallucination, and I shall come out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it directly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long moment we stood regarding each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with surprise and wonder. Then the human aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the situation asserted itself, and, sensing that cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain amenities were required of me, I thanked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in as well-selected words as my muddled brain could</seg><seg type="columnLine">muster..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the choice of words was of little mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, for he accepted my gratitude with a courteous</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture, and made rejoinder in words that had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning for me. Then, as I gazed'at my strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings--for they were indeed strange in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail--he stood, wondering who I was and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came from. Then for the first time T perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I still held the little disc in my hand. Turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over I read the number,--14. As I stood gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this very commonplace number, a realization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened flashed upcn me, and I said, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud, "So this is the Fourteenth Earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About this time my companion became aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was out of my element--lost in a strange world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with no apparent hesitation, assumed the role</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conductor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were, in what seemed to be a park, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds of a large estate, and he led me to a near-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench and bade, me be seated. Then he took from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket an. instrument resembling a very small desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock. This he held in his hand, while he made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few rapid adjustments, and to my surprise, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to it. He was apparently giving the listener</seg><seg type="columnLine">some instructions, which I, of course, was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand. Then he put the instrument back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pocket, and came and sat beside me in a friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly manner. Almost immediately a small light ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hicle came swiftly along the drive in front, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted directly opposite us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FOURTEENTH EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1095</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was rather a surprising performance, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no driver, and apparently no compartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">large enough to house the engine. Straightway my</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion entered, and motioned me to a seat beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then, by manipulating a small dial, he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car rolling very gradually along the road. Di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly we commenced to gain speed, and I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my surprise, that little flanges were coming out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the spokes of the wheels. (There were no fend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers.) These- flanges seemed to catch the air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to propel us along. Then gradually two sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal started to unfurl on each side of the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">providing two wings, each held rigid on top by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of X-bracing that resembled a collapsible sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port for a desk telephone. We now seemed to touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground only very lightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOON we came to a dense wood, and while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wondering where the road could penetrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, we rose evenly from the ground, and passed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Nor did we alight again until shortly before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached our destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We approached a city, and passed many convey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances resembling our own. As we drew near a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large building, to some extent like a modern hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but much more ornate, we came down and glided</seg><seg type="columnLine">along a smooth broad street. Passing along this</seg><seg type="columnLine">street were a great many people, who observed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the keenest interest. All were barefoot, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore only sandals on their feet, and their other</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing appeared to be but a single garment. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of quite heavy but so'ft material, and reminded me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a child's rompers. It fitted only very loosely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left off at the elbows and knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My companion conducted me into a spacious hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thence into a small but elegant library, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were perhaps a couple of dozen people, ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in what I took to be scientific apparatus. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide called out in a very cheery voice, and they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered around us in great excitement, and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discussing me, and especially my clothes, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they examined very minutely. My companion ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibited, me in a very proprietary way. I gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they called him Akon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After a rather lengthy discussion, Akon mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair, and made a little speech. He punctuated this</seg><seg type="columnLine">oration with gestures, now toward the others and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now toward me. I supposed that he was introduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me, and so when he was done I bowed and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to appear at ease, which caused them no</seg><seg type="columnLine">little amusement; the reason for this I did not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover till some time afterward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Akon and two of the others conducted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a private apartment and after demonstrating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various household devices for my comfort, they with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew, only to return in a few moments with an ample</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tasty supper, which they placed before me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took their leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was hungry and tired and so amazed and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused that I was only too glad to be alone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">food proved to be very palatable. There was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a variety of it, but I was unable to determine of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the dishes were composed. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat or vegetables, in natural state. Everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be cast in molds, like manufactured</seg><seg type="columnLine">products.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Soon I noticed that it was growing dark out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, and I wondered if I could compose myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently to go to sleep. I stayed awake till far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into the night, trying to piece together my varied</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences, unable to decide what it all meant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was apparent that my body had undergone a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of atomic structure, assuming a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">density. This, no doubt, was the reason I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become so much smaller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was also clear that I had descended into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, to a place where the atomic density of the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of an inner stratum was sufficient to sustain</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in my altered condition. Here all the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were approximately my own size, and no doubt, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the same density. I decided that the hardness</seg><seg type="columnLine">or density of the things of this surface must bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the same relation to the density of the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratum above, as our common earthly things do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stratum that we call air; and it occurred to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what I was breathing might be a great many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times more solid than granite rock. I fell to won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering how it could be that the little disc had power</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change the proportion of the electrons to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons in all the various parts of my body, yes, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my very clothes and shoes, and still permit me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live to tell the story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN my thoughts wandered back to the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of Mr. Kingston. I had not thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him since morning. Now I had no doubt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate. Like me, he was taking up his residence in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange land; I wondered what he looked like, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should ever see him. I wondered what the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the disc that he might accidentally have</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped. What an age it seemed since I left home</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next morning, Akon and his two friends came</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me and took me before a judge. I waited with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no little anxiety, while a lengthy document was react</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while the court questioned each of the three in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. At length he seemed satisfied, and after his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seal had been affixed to the document, we were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Not for some weeks afterward did I learn what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all about. It seems that on my arrival, Akon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had presented me, as a gift of a scientific nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his club, much as a public spirite'd man might</seg><seg type="columnLine">present a rare trophy to a museum. And that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared before the court with a petition, asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the trustees be made my guardians and cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">todians, assuming responsibility for my care and sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port; and further promising the state the benefit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any scientific discovery that might be made through</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Upon returning to headquarters, I was exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined very minutely, weighed, measured and photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphed. I will here mention only three particulars</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which it was found that I differed from them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My toes, although normal, were much longer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs. In fact, they had only vestiges of toes, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no nails. Their thumbs were decidedly further over</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the middle of their hands than mine, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a correspondingly greater dexterity. They took par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular notice of my tonsils, and obligingly showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that they had none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From these observations I decided that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little farther along than we are, a little older in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme of existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The physical examination over, they set to work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out what I knew. Some writing was placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me, to see if I knew anything of a written</seg><seg type="columnLine">language, and some balls were slowly counted. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up a pencil and wrote a few words, which of</seg><seg type="columnLine">1096</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">course they could not read. Then I took up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls, and counted them aloud in order to show them</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew something of numbers. At this they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed, and apparently called it a day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After lunch Akon took me for a drive in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. Although it was midsummer, I was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to see no crops growing, and no sign of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">domestic animals. There were a great many beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful trees, and here and there I saw extensive land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scape gardening. There were very few signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">industry. There were many detached houses, scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered over the landscape, all built of the finest stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But everything was strange. The trees were differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent in shape and in foliage, the grass of a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">green--and in fact everything about me was beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">my understanding. I came home at night more be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered than ever. The following day th|y set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to teach me the language, for it was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I must learn to talk to them if they were ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn much about my history. Akon undertook</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teach me himself. He pointed to objects and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called them by name. I repeated after him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to remember as many as possible from day to</seg><seg type="columnLine">day; for instance, as we call ourselves people, so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">called themselves feli.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly I had learned a few words he introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">their alphabet, which I found very simple and easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to write. I applied myself diligently to the work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and within a few weeks found that I was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratifying progress. At the end of three months, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could speak well enough to tell the society Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my world and how I came to the Fourteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. Accordingly I met with them one day in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembly room, and told them, very slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboriously (and I have no doubt very awkwardly),</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few of the things about our world that I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">might interest them most. I described, as far as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, my accidental descent to their world within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. They heard me very patiently, albeit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some merriment, and asked me a great many ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Many of these I was unable to understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some I could not answer, because my vocabulary</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still so limited. However, I gave them my</seg><seg type="columnLine">disc, with the magic 14 on its side and asked them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyze it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now I could learn something of this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wonderful country. Now I could ask questions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and understand explanations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I LEARNED, among Other things, that all .food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost everything else used by the feli was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made directly from primary elements; that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so familiar with the functions of electrons and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons that they were able to combine them with ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">to form any known substance--many substances</seg><seg type="columnLine">still unknown to us. Thus they were relieved of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of growing food stuffs, and of raising do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mestic animals. They were relieved of the necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mining as we practise it, and of a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturing. They had reduced all production to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its lowest terms--power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These electrons and protons which we associate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with electricity, they associate with light. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrating that all power and all matter are only</seg><seg type="columnLine">different manifestations of light, and they believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if they can discover what light is, they will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered the secret of life. There all transporta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is carried on by motive force, generated at a cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral plant and broadcast to what they call "light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">motors" on the cars. These motors were so small</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at first they escaped my notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of their religion, I was able to learn but little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their word for the divinity is Thegel. They build</seg><seg type="columnLine">no churches and hold 110 public services; but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">any progress is made in science or invention, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangible evidence of this achievement is placed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small chapel or shrine, and allowed to remain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">state, so to speak, for three days. For instance, if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine is discovered to cure a heretofore incurable</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease, a jar of the medicine is left in one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">chapels for three days. There is one of these little</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings in each village, and one for every few</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand inhabitants in the cities. I asked Akon</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this peculiar custom, but his answers were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little vague. "That is for Thegel," he said. "Is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to see?" I asked, and after some hesita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he explained. "We do not know if Thegel</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees or hears, or ever has need of any of our earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses; but we hope that there is some kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization that we are making earnest effort, in fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">some progress, meager though it may be, to avail</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves of the divine gifts; that we are struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to a higher plane of existence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the only manifestation of any religious</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief I saw during my stay. At first it seemed very</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive to me; and I wondered since their civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was manifestly older than ours, that their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligion should be so undeveloped. Their written</seg><seg type="columnLine">history, with some few lapses, extends back over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of approximately eleven thousand years, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paring very favorably with our six or seven thousand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ability to write, or in some way to record events,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is usually considered the factor that differentiates</seg><seg type="columnLine">the civilized man from the savage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1WAS led to contemplate the evolution of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion, and was surprised to find that, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of growing in complexity, it was gradually becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplified. In the old pagan days, there were nu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merous gods and goddesses, some good, some bad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And many of the natural phenomena, such as floods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanoes, etc., were looked upon as activities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods. Sacrifices of animals and even" human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were offered with great ceremony. Huge temples</seg><seg type="columnLine">were erected. It took the toil of a great nation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations to build some of them. Now all is</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. No more sacrifices. Only one God.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buildings comparatively modest, and ceremonies</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more simplified. The major portion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious beliefs that were in vogue a few centuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, were now looked upon as ignorant superstition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So it may be in the course of a few thousand years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our conception of the Deity may become less personal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many of our present religious beliefs may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">relegated to the realm of superstition, and our quest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the divine Will may take the form of delving into</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature's secrets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As I gradually learned to read the scientific litera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the feli, I found that they had long held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory that the earth was composed of successive</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentric layers of varying degrees of density, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately a thousand miles in thickness; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these layers became more dense and solid in inverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratio to their outer circumference; that these various</seg><seg type="columnLine">surfaces were inhabited, was still in the realm of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecture, even as we speculate as to whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are people living on the planet Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Recently some scientists of recognized ability had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FOURTEENTH EARTH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed to have secured proof that there was human</seg><seg type="columnLine">life on at least one of these outer surfaces; but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcements were received in about the same spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we take the protestations of Frederic Meyers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ledbetter, that they are in communication with dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">embodied spirits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  However, my coming was now hailed as positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof that this theory was entirely tenable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On one memorable occasion, Akon told me that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to some distant reducing grounds, to view</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reduction of large vats of material, and invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to accompany him, assuring me that it was a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful spectacle. I accompanied him the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">gladly, because it would afford me a few days' respite</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my studies, which I had been pursuing of late</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such absorbing interest that I was not. a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigued.	\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We traveled for some days in leisurely fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping at various places of interest. I only wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were time and space to record all the won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful things I saw on that journey, but if I did, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily brief narrative must become a book, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that book a series of volumes. So I must confine</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to the object of our quest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Upon our arrival, we took up our headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a point several miles distant from the "works."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here we found a large number of high-powered tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopes, mounted in temporary buildings resembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the general lay-out of our erst-while popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">"World's Fair" expositions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next day we visited the works, and my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion explained their nature in technical language</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rather outstripped my understanding, both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific terms and of engineering processes. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, this much I gleaned: the subsoil in this region</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rich in elementary substances, such as we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">call minerals; and from these substances, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily reducible, they drew among other things large</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores of electrons and protons, which they combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in various ratios to produce nearly every known sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A PORTION of territory was selected and</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated from its surroundings by applying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated ray of decomposing light upon the soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such a way as to produce a wall or partition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">decomposed soil and subsoil, from which certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements were removed. This partition, being a non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor of heat and, light, served to form the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundary lines of the tract to be treated. The de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">composing ray was played over the surface rapidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to form a layer of the same non-conducting material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act as a cover or blanket to retain the gases created</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the reducing process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The container or vat thus being completed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of reducing the enclosed mass was begun; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a combination of heat and light was projected into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mass for weeks, from huge generators, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">•night and day till the entire bulk to a great depth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reduced to a molten mass of liquid charged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas, like a submerged lake of fire. In the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, it was several miles in extent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When all was sufficiently melted, a huge rent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in the surface by means of explosives, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases allowed to escape, as from a steel plant. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">this escape of gas that provides the spectacle so prized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the feli.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The remaining material is then allowed to cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and constitutes a vast storehouse, which may be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn on for substances for months, or in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases even for years. At the appointed time we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a vast crowd among the buildings where the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopes were housed, prepared for a rare treat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, without warning, the entire sky was</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminated. After a few seconds, the sound of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion reached us. We saw a column of fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke slowly ascending from the vat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were shooting rays like the Northern Lights;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were areas of dense blackness, shot -through</seg><seg type="columnLine">at intervals with flashes of every shade of color that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human eye can conceive. There were blazes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense light, such as accompany bursts of shrapnel;</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling clouds of sulphur-colored gases, and in fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a display of light and color as one might expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">if all the oil wells and chemical factories in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all rolled into one, and all on fire at once. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the flaming mass rose higher into the sky, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">column gradually assumed more definite shape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. In the center, there arose a fiery column,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting straight toward the zenith, and on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of this a column of less brilliance, as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incandescent column were surrounded by a cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fluorescence, which rapidly faded toward its cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumference. This column was very large at the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom, occupying a space of perhaps 15° of the circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This diminished in size as it ascended, in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way as the rails of a railway appear to converge in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance, when one looks along a level stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">track. This column grew smaller and smaller till it</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally disappeared at the limit of vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After gazing for some time at this scene, entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">engrossed by its magnitude and splendor, I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that I was alone, my companions and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">around me having gone in to the telescopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I followed after them and found them gathered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles around the great mirrors that reflected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnified images from the gigantic instruments. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I approached the one by which I had previously been</seg><seg type="columnLine">assigned a seat beside Akon, I saw a spectacle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance and grandeur rivalling anything I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced. There rose the luminous' column, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a tapering cone, disappearing in the darkness, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a splendid creation of light and color, standing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and magnificent in every detail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOW shall I describe it? Words can only con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey a most imperfect and inadequate picture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In general effect it was as though you would place a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of very tall and graceful vases, one on top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another; vases somewhat enlarged at the bottom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapering toward the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I remarked to Akon that this seemed to me to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very peculiar phenomenon; he agreed with me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that these enlargements occurring at regular in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals, were thought to be caused by the varying</seg><seg type="columnLine">density of the successive layers of the earth. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volume of any gas varies in direct ratio to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure that confines it, whenever this gas ascends</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a stratum of diminished density, it expands, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing the bowl of the vase. Then, as it rises to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater height, it naturally appears to dwindle in size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming the neck of the vase, till it passes through</seg><seg type="columnLine">another stratum, expanding into another bowl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Almost mechanically, I counted the successive en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">largements. There were thirteen of them. Then for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second time since my arrival in this strange land,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, "This must be the Fourteenth Earth."

These streams faded in the distance till they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">merged with the darkness of the sky. The illumina-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion was so brilliant, that after gazing for some time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was obliged to shut my eyes to rest them; and as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I did so 1 became conscious that this picture bore a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">striking likeness to something I had seen or known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about, long ago.

I saw a fiery volcano, belching forth death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and destruction; with the white-hot streams of lava</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pouring down the mountain sides, engulfing homes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and cities, and boiling into the sea.

Seeing all was not well with me, he hastened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to ask solicitously what was the matter. For the life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of me, I could not think of one word of that wretched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">language with which to answer him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As one turns away from a revolting scene, I turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away from the mirror.

This was true up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of years ago, when Doctor Zambi, the noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">French scientist, invented, or discovered, Xerolla.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This chemical is a very powerful anesthetic, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">enables us to place a patient in a state of complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended animation for a period of forty-eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, with no deleterious reaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Dr. Zambi also invented, or discovered, Collo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diansy, a combination of chemicals which, when ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied to the lips of an incision, causes it to commence</seg><seg type="columnLine">healing rapidly at once--is almost healed in twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, entirely healed in twenty-four hours and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-six hours the scars are almost invisible. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two agents, Xerolla and Collodiansy, it has be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come such a simple operation that we no longer con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider it in the major class.

Between sighting and shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at enemy planes, I would lie on the ground smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">those black, offensive ropes that the French Supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corps called cigars. Blowing rings and watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as they ascended into the breeze, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were torn to shreds, I dreamed of home and peace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, while in such a mood, a dragon-fly darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the road and poised for a moment above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact center of a smoke ring. Then was the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">born. The dragon-fly was an airplane and the smoke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring was some gaseous, yet substantial material. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a simple matter to bring down enemy planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">then! Such at least was the suggestion. The ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rising, would be sure to spread over a vast area</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cause considerable disturbance in the air about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That idea came to my mind many times after I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned to the States. I made mental plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the completion of the machine. I studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation of the human mouth and throat while form-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rings. When the plans were finally developed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point where I believed it warranted an actual ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment, I went to Ava, Ohio, where I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to experiment without interference or</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. Why I should have selected Ava of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, I will never know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rented a huge three-story barn three miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest farmhouse and began to gather my</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery for turning out smoke rings. My early</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments were successful in a way. I made a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings hundreds of feet thick and a mile or more in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter, but they were of gas and lacked solidity--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very necessary requirement. I remember the furore</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was created in Ava the night I sent up a ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of explosive gases; the ring shot to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of two miles, spreading out to a diameter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles, and there ignited. The explosion lit up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole country-side. Always, for the sake of safety</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and secrecy, I carried these experiments on at night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, I was not at all sure as to how the world at</seg><seg type="columnLine">large would accept the idea of a man secluding him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the country for the mere purpose of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke rings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came real development. I spent many weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging and walling a shaft thirty feet deep into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard ground and rising twenty feet above the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the barn. This shaft was the exact center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ring apparatus.' In the early hours of September 3d,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made the finishing touches. Anxious to see my</seg><seg type="columnLine">latest scheme at work, I determined to give it a trial</seg><seg type="columnLine">test then. As I scanned the heavy leaden night</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens, I noticed that a storm was approaching from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north. Now and then the moon broke through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hurrying clouds, lighting up the dark landscape</seg><seg type="columnLine">in weird patches of light and shadow. Over the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant town of Ava, the lightning flashed and rumbled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air was chill and I felt a vague oppressive weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending upon me. However, I shook it off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned my mind to the work on hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great," I thought, "if all is to the good, I'll bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hole a mile in diameter through those clouds over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head." Running to the switchboard, I threw in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switches controlling the many air pumps and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost an hour the pumps kept up their maddening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thump, chug, thump, chug as they filled the gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the valves were opened, letting the hot moist</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring-gases fill the central well. Going up to the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see if the clouds were dense enough, I made sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the well cover was tightly closed. Reassured, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the compressed air tanks, thereby admitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed air into the well and placing the ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases under tremendous pressure. The air was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">initial propellent. I waited a few minutes and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pulled the release cord. A low hiss arose as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases escaped from the well and there rose into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, the most perfect ring I had ever made, so black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opaque that it was more like a ring of steel than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flimsy gas ring. Swiftly and silently it rushed up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, growing larger and larger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I saw something that froze the blood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my veins. High above the rising ring was the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender shape of a Zeppelin outlined in the break of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouds. The moon shone on her sides for an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, then all was black, even the ring was lost to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lightning flashed close by and rain began to patter</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the roof. I stood as in a trance, in a horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare,' hoping and hoping against hope that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine of destruction was a failure. I stood there, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know not how long, it might have been centuries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I was awakened from my stupor by the heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rending crash of a metal body meeting the unyielding</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found myself dashing across the fields, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">groves of trees, slipping in muddy ditches, as I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way in the direction of the crash. I came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene and stopped, overcome by horror. Slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the realization of what I had done gripped me. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it! I! "You murderer!" screamed the crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and torn framework of what had once been the pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">of America. The ghastly severed girders stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">their long pointed fingers accusingly at me. I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hours brooding over the ruins. The milling</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, which quickly gathered, darted here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sort of a daze, excited and horrified by what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SMOKE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On my way back to the accursed barn, I came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of men removing an engine from a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried gondola. The souvenir collectors were even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then at work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was months, years ago. I dared not tell that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had sent the Shenandoah to her death. No, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been thrown into some asylum. I kept my</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence and awaited with sad forebodings the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my terrible act. Yet, was I to blame? I see the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RINGS	1105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">set-back I have caused aeronautics.

Air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, too, become unmanageable in the clutch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a gas ring that destroyed the Shenandoah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  THE END.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">POLLOCK AND THE PORROH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By H.

The readers criticize certain points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain stories as being impossible because "it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the law of gravitation," or for some similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. What do they read the magazine for? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is fiction, and fiction can be as wild as possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither is it necessary that it be possible for a story</seg><seg type="columnLine">to happen--impossible themes are very interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I will be well satisfied if you continue the maga</seg><seg type="columnLine">zine as it is now, in almost every respect. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a fine balance of serials, complete stories, new</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, and reprints. The covers and illustrations arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine and very interesting. Your comments on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, and the "Discussions" column are satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory. In my opinion, the magazine shows long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seasoned judgment in its arrangement; also, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">very friendly attitude in your comments on the vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous stories, inspires confidence and creates friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. In particular. I am pleased with your policy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of labeling all continued stories as such, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of installments. So many magazines start</seg><seg type="columnLine">a story and the reader does not know if it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue for two issues or twenty-two. I read all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the continued stories, but never until T have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">issues containing all the installments (unless, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I seem to be naturally interested in science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When barely in my teens I took up the study of</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomy and observing, and absolutely unaided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except by books. I located all the constellations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Xorthern Hemisphere, so that I might say I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could "call the stars by name." I went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject thoroughly and deeply. Then, about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">decade ago, while in the Navy. I was at the Naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">Observatory at Mare Island for about a year, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">told, carrying on the scientific work there, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">transi; observations, time reduction, chronometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparison, and observation (for my own interest)</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the five-inch telescope they had, built in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1873 by Alvan Clark for the observation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transit of Venus. While at the Naval Observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had the privilege of being secretary to Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">T. T. J. See. in charge, and I found him to be one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most honorable, and high idealed men I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever known, with a beautiful character, and scion</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific ability which will rank with the greatest of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">lime. In the past few years I have entered other</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, but still have a great interest in science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Note: T might remark that the Naval Observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">at. Mare Island, California, is primarily a time sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. doing chronometer comparison for the Navy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sending out time signals, and is not a regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar observatory, neither the telescope nor sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings being suitable). In addition to the above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was lucky enough to go below the equator, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">T could observe and learn most of the southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">constellations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The above paragranh is rather detailed, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it to show that I have the background to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciate good scientific stories when I see them. T</seg><seg type="columnLine">have read Amazing Storirs from the beginning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have every issue. It is quite a satisfaction for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to write this letter now, not that I wish or</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to influence the policy of your magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">(which I do not wish to change), but because it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a pleasure to recall the stories read in it, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they affected me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Starting with the very first issued, April, 1926:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was glad to get, in a convenient form, the Jules</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verne story, "Off on a Comet." Verne is not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">so easy for me to read, as when I first perused his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, and some years ago I read practically every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that was available in this country. But it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great satisfaction to have many of his works on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and I am apt to go back and reread them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In "The Man from the Atom" and "The Thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from--Outside," you . have stories of superlative</seg><seg type="columnLine">merit. The latter one is suggestive of Algernon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackwood's "The Willows," which is a type of</seg><seg type="columnLine">story I like perhaps better than any other kind, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as much as any other kind, at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The story, "The Man Who Saved the Earth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not appeal to me, and it was about the last one</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have picked for re-publication in the fivsl</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Annual." Not so much was it the plot, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">technique, I think one might say. Too much work</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of Providence, and Fate, and even the begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, and broken sentences. Hpvvever, I will re</seg><seg type="columnLine">read it sometime, and probably like it better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When reading Amazing Stories, I mark the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-lories when I finish them, using marks to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much I liked them. For instance, the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">"1" means the story is good enough to merit my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention, "2" is good, "3" is very good, "4" is</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent, and "5" is the highest degree. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">later on. T can tell what stories I wish to read.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Man from the Atom" and "The Thing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Outside" are of the fifth degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In regard to Poe, and Wells--more later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In May. 3926--"The Man from the Atom," a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequel to the one in the previous issue, is also of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fifth degree. "The Crystal Egg," with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine cover illustration, was noticeable, but seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consist in somebody looking into a crystaj and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing a Martian landscape, which was weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, but nothing happened, and it was very weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to plot. "The Infinite Vision" seemed rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposeless also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In June, 1926--"The Coming of the Tee" is of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth degree, next to the best. "Whispering</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ether" was an interesting story "The Runaway</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skyscraper" was of the fifth degree, and T only</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish it were longer. "Mr. Fosdick" and "An Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment in Gyro-TIats," and similar stories, fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">nish a kind of comic relief, which I will read, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a humorous scientific story or ghost story seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rather anomalous. Personally, I am not attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by them, though many others like them. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malignant Entity" is of the fifth degree, though T</seg><seg type="columnLine">had read it previously. The criticism of the comic</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief stories does not apply to "Dr. Hackensaw's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secrets"--they are so full of ideas that I consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to be very valuable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> July, 1926--"Station X" is of the fifth degree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shows great thought and ability. The "Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metal" was very interesting, as was "The Mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic Storm," both of which are of the third or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth derrrees. I thought "The Eggs from Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tanganyika" was interesting, but not particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">noteworthy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Wells--T wish to cover all his stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the latter part of this letter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> August, 1926--"Columbus of Space," is good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there seems to be a kind of drag in most inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetarian stories--the formula being almost al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ways about the same--consisting of a woifd cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, near death from bombarding meteors, etc. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Talking Brain," we have a story of the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree (all these graded in my estimation, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course), which was horrible and attractive. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue publishing horrible stories once in awhile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They can't be worse than much of actual life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'High Tension" was also noteworthy. Jules Verne</seg><seg type="columnLine">is always worthwhile (referring to all of his stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">you publish, including "Doctor Ox's Experiment,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this issue), but I do agree that his style is rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mid-Victorian, and comparatively hard to read in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this present age. But so are Scott, Thackeray, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickens. I really believe the fault is with us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our environment, rather than with these authors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> September, 1926, did not stand out so much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous volumes or issues of Amazing Stories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than that it had a continuation of ".Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion X."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Octoker, 1926--Hurrah for "Beyond the Pole."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It merits the fifth degree.

"Blasphemer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plateau" was second degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> November, 1926--One of the most fascinating</seg><seg type="columnLine">and interesting stories published to this date (Oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tober, 1927) in Amazing Stories, is "The Second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deluge," by Garrett P. Serviss. The Psychology</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perfect and true to life. Just as in the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Noah, they ridiculed and refused to believe, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is in this story. "And the Flood Came!" "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mad Planet" is worth a second reading at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> December, 1926--"The Time Eliminator" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightful, and I wish it had been longer.

Rather plotless, and filled full of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dumpy, sloppy descriptions which drag terribly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They are so painfully put together, that he gives</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one the impression that he was forcing himself to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">write, and just to fill space. Most of his stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have fine plots, but the technique of Wells is irri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tating to me. Without the ability of character de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lineation of Scott or Dickens, he yet writes in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nineteenth century tiresome style. I think lie' has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us buffaloed, or he thinks he has, but I, for one,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see through Herbert George Wells. If I read "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">War of the Worlds" right, it seems that accounts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">filtered out from the vicinity of where the Martians</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first used their death ray, telling of great death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and destruction. But none of the population of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other places was interested at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I like F.ngland and the British nation, and though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they may be rather dull at times, they are not as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dopey as Wells makes them out to be. in their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">handling of the Martian invasion. Furthermore,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what were, the other notions of the earth doing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while Great Britain was undergoing this trouble?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wells blithefully ignores this most important part</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of such a situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   However, I carefully read most of the stuff by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wells you publish, and am glad to have it. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he certainly does not rank as high as many of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other authors whose works you publish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I think that A.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Machine Man of Ardathia the author has had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the character go insane. Perhaps this is making it</seg><seg type="columnLine">go a little too harsh, but in many of your stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hero either goes insane, is killed or else dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears and is not seen thereafter.

In most of such stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">this unhappy even! absolutely prevents a sequel</seg><seg type="columnLine">being written to the story. "In the Abyss" is</seg><seg type="columnLine">another instance. To a story like- The Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tool" a sequel might easily be written.

I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciate tlin, thinner paper as I am having my</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazines hound, and the compactness will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an advantage.

My main objection to the latter author is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he draws out his stories too much. In "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">War of the Worlds" he sure has a rotten army.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, no army could stand long against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heat-Kay, but they surely should have given a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better account of themselves than they did give.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could have put on gas-masks to protect them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves from the "black smoke," they could probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">have exterminated the Martians if their guns were</seg><seg type="columnLine">any good at all, and if not. could have sent up</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirigibles or airplanes, with bombs.

One author in par-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ticular appears to be the target of censure. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is poor, abused Mr. Wells. Some of the self-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appointed critics do not have the common decency</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to adhere to the regulations of convention, in their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fervor of derision, but resort to the vocabulary of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the pugnacious illiterates, to express their vehe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mence.

In the first place,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">length of description is a matter of opinion. Charles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dickens was a past master in the art of diffusive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">definitions. Still, his works are considered classics</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the intelligentsia. If a reader demands his lit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">erature in abbreviated form, there arc books of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this quality in every librarian's establishment. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lighter and more violent form of fiction should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">satiate this uncontrollable passion which looks for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">action in every line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The request that his stories be eliminated is not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only extremely egotistic, but ludicrous as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pardon my cynical attitude, but it's laughable to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hear a person of little or no literary standing tear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing a recognized genius, in his particular line, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shreds, with no fundamental data to base his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">criticism on. The countless others, who are enter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tained by the despised tales, are given no considera-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion. The ever-present sense of overindulged ego</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">demands that the displeasing sections be abolished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Such a specimen has the consummate presumption to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">say, "Vanity, thy name is woman." 1 have always</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">believed that egotism was the fundamental basis of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">existence, but 1 detest seeing the veneer of culture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being so rudely thrust aside and the egotistic ele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment so forcibly applied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Don't labor under the impression that I am H. G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wells' champion. He is one of my favorite authors,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but my scope of literature has been wide and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">varied. His remarkable imagination, his phrase-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ology and his technique in description are the un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">derlying factors that bring me to his defence. I am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well aware of the fact that it is unnecessary to de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fend him, but I derive a certain amount of pleas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ure during the procedure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Another of your correspondents waxes philosophic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and defines the "intrinsic impossibility." Philosophy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and intrinsic do not combine.

Since philosophy fails to admit the abso-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lute state of anything, the intrinsic impossibility</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must revert to the practical in a relative state. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thus becomes a minor truth influenced by the major</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or philosophic truth, which disproves the absolute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and renders the practical impossibility unstable.

G. Wells, although much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more can be said for him. Probably every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't like him. Our tastes are not all alike, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can at least give others credit for having some</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste. As to your other authors Mr. Merritt is, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, ray firm favorite. He is great! The way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can make words live is a marvel. This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality that made Poe, and I notice that Serviss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill, Verne, Wells, and, to a certain extent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burroughs, all have it. The latter is a good writer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he certainly has a good imagination, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a good deal of sameness to some of his books.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ralph Milne Farley, who had three stories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus, "The Radio Man," "The Radio Beasts,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "The Radio Planet,'' in one of the Munsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">publications, has better science. In the last for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, the earth-born hero is forced to construct</seg><seg type="columnLine">a radio apparatus entirely from the material that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in nature. There is also a race, or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">several races, of intelligent insects which contest</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supremacy of the more human inhabitants. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should surely like to see these in Amazing Stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as some of Conan Doyle's scientific stories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His latest "Marascot Deep," is now running in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Saturday Evening Post."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to Science and Invention re-prints, by all</seg><seg type="columnLine">means have them. But start from the beginning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We are not al&gt; old^ readers, especially we younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasts. Ray Cummings has clone good work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past, and many of us would like to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Dr. Hackensaw started. I, for one, had read</seg><seg type="columnLine">some six stories about him when they suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.

As for the Annual, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might make it both annual and semi-annual. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, a long novel once a year, or perhaps two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and say one old and one new story by favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">authors twice a year.

I have always taken an interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in _ science and scientific fiction, and have greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed many of the stories which have appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">m this magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think your policy of reprinting stories by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jules Verne, II. G. Wells etc., is a very good</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, and it is very interesting to read them again</seg><seg type="columnLine">after many_ years. In this connection, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to ask if you could reprint some of the stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">by George Griffiths, of which "A Honeymoon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space" is one of the best known. I think this</seg><seg type="columnLine">story is out of print now, and I am sure that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was reprinted as a serial in your magazine, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be much appreciated. As far as I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, the story was to some extent divided into</seg><seg type="columnLine">episodes, one of which could appear each month.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This author has written several very good yarns</seg><seg type="columnLine">on scientific lines, though I cannot now remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names, and T, for one, would very much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read them again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would ^ like, however, to join issue with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the subject of reprinting stories which have just</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out in book form. I bought a copy of "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Land That Time Forgot" shortly _ before it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out III your magazine, and as the instalments were</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, and took up a considerable amount of space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt that I was being done out of a good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reading matter each month. Unless you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">print a story before it comes out in book form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am sure it is a mistake to put it in a magazine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, this is quite a different matter from</seg><seg type="columnLine">reprinting old stories by well-known authors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The above brings me naturally to commenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the letters from A.

In other words, time may be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> said to be that which intervenes between a happen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing and its perception by the human mind or be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tween any two or more happenings which did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> take place at the same instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now, in a strict sense of the word, an instant of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> time would be the same throughout the entire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> universe. An event happening in one part of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> universe actually happens in the most diverse part of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the universe at the same instant, l'erhaps it may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> not be perceived as happening until thousands of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> years later. 1 lowever this discrepancy is not due</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to the happening but to the media by. which the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> action is transmitted throughout all space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Unfortunately light rays are the only means we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have of perceiving an action unless we take into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> consideration radio, sound or electrical means iiut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> what would hold true for light would hold true for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> these also, so we will confine our illustrations to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> light rays only.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Light has a finite speed of approximately 186,000</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> miles a second, far, very far from instantaneous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consequently an action, taking place at a distant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> point would not be perceived by us at our point</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of observation until the light rays or vibrations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> set up by the action reached us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   If this action or happening was carried by media</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> whose speed was instantaneous and we had instru-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ments or senses to intercept it, any action happening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> any place in space woujd be perceived at any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> other point in space at the actual instant it hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pened instead of at a later time.

How-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">i this viewing of past events must necessarily be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">y a pictorial perception as it is evidently im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sible for the physical present to mingle with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">~-'w^ysical past.

Our good friend Doctor Mentiroso</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     seems to believe this to be possible and cited several</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     instances where he had actually witnessed an event</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     several hours before it was reported as happening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     in the opposite side of the world although the w'ord</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     was sent almost immediately over the press wires</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     S alrd^should have been at the most only a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     minutes late in arriving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Now here is where I must differ very radically</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    from our learned Doctor, because from any angle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    which f can conceive of, I cannot imagine man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    ever invading the future and, witnessing future</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    events before they happen. Any witnessing of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    future events such as claimed by our learned Doc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    tor would have to he done by a joggling of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    time unit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       As we stated before, any action or object creates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    a disturbance in a certain media such as light and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    this affects our senses of sight causing us to per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    ceive the action or object, the time intervening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    depending on the distance the light waves must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    travel. Consequently it is self-evident that unless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    we have the action or object to create the waves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    in the medium we could have no perception of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     The mere fact that our learned Doctor was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   able to perceive an event apparently twelve hours</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   before it happened was due to the rather crude</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   method which man has invented for telling the dura-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   tion of time on this planet. He has adopted an ar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   bitrary system based upon the sun's position but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   unfortunately the sun docs not rise at the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   period of time at all points on the earth, there be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ing a difference of twelve hours from one point to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   a directly opposite point. In other words the sun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   rises twelve hours later at a point directly opposite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   New York than it does at New York, yet in reality</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   it is the same instant of time every place on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   To make up for this discrepancy man has con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   veniently set his time picces back to correspond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   to sun-time. Thus a person traveling instantane-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ously around the earth from east to west and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   setting his watch to correspond to the prevailing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   . time at any specified points would find on returning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   that he had lost a day and night, or in other words,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   his watch would be twenty-four hours slow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Now that is the condition our friend Dr. Men-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    tiroso found and he set his watch according to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    prevailing time in the places he visited. Conse-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    quently he arrived in his starting place according to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    his watch several hours before he started. Looking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    at it from this angle a news item may be pub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    lished before it happened, due to the difference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    in time between the two points and to the rapid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    means of communication, while in th&lt;5 true sense</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    of the word the event happened at just one instant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    of time and as such was registered in all parts of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    the universe at that instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Now- such a condition as above stated should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    not exist in this enlightened age of rapid com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    munication. It seems to me that the same instant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    of time should be specified the same throughout the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    entire universe and that sun time should be made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    to correspond. Twelve noon should be twelve noon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    at every point even though the sun was on the op-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    posite side of the earth at the time. Perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    future generations may make this correction and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    do away with the possibility of a news item ar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    riving in one part of the world before it was sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    posed to have happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      I hope now that I have succeeded in exposing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    the fallacy of the theories of Doctor Mentiroso of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    penetrating into the future in the true sense of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    the word. Let us always bear in mind in ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    pounding any other theories of future forecasting,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    that it is always necessary to have the action or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    object before our senses or any medium for regis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    tering it will perceive or carry it. Thus it is self</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    evident that any future forecasts are an impossi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    bility and can exist only in the imagination of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    clairvoyants and fiction writers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                  B.

His story,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The War of the Worlds," started all right, hut its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ending was terrible. Why? Because he makes the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  brother's chronicle too long. lie takes a little plot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  that would ordinarily cover only a paragraph or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  two and makes it take up a couple of chapters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There are only two more criticisms that I have,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and these are: Why print those beastly detective</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and humorous stories?

You can glean from the heading of my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> letter that I am a printer, while not a large com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mercial man nor one of vast experience in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> game, I have some ideas about the dress of printed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I offer these suggestions, and trust that no offense</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> will be taken at the criticisms, nor will they be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> misunderstood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In the first place, looking at the magazine from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the inside out, I find there are not many publica-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tions which contain the material, both from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> standpoint of conversational English, and from that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of ideas, which I find in your Amazing Stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can hardly call it literature, which 1 would like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to do, but it resembles it very much. The authors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have very good imaginations, and have material</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which contains food for thought even for would-be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> scientists, in which group I would be classed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As I said looking at the book from the inside out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> !t has merit which does not reflect from the outside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> m. if you could and would get away from those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> heavy lithographed covers, and use half-tones</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (with a slight change in the style of the drawings),</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it would have more appeal to the public. I mean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to more of the public. Then too if you would use</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a white book paper instead of the heavy newsprint</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> you now use, and command more advertisements to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> off-set the added expense, it would create a larger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> circulation, and then you would get a better class</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of advertisers and incidentally form a,more or less</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> endless chain between advertisers and circulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It can be done, and I hope it will be done, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I m very much interested in the success of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> magazine, and want it to continue. I hope within</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tne next four months to submit a storv similar to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garret Smith's "Treasures of Tantalus," and vet it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is different enough not to have the aspect of being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> copied or of being a take off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A few more illustrations (in the new magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggested) would be beneficial providing that you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can find other artists who can blend in with Paul,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for that type of sketches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I have been wondering whv some enterprising</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fellow doesn't locate an author in or near Berlin or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">\ lenna, and obtain some authentic fiction about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">present trend of' science.
