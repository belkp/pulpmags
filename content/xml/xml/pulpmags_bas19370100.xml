                <span type="columnLine">before Betty Carruthers as she swung</span>
                <span type="columnLine">around the corner of Old Main, causing</span>
                <span type="columnLine">her to step back with a quick, startled cry.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">A voice from the darkness spoke reassur-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ingly.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">“Sorry, Miss! Guess I wasn’t looking</span>
                <span type="columnLine">where I was going. Oh, Miss Carruthers!”</span>
                <span type="columnLine">5</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">She recognized the voice. It was that</span>
                <span type="columnLine">country boy, Dan Carter. The one Hal</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Gordon and the rest of her friends had</span>
                <span type="columnLine">nicknamed “Gawky.” There was a faint</span>
                <span type="columnLine">amusement in her tone as she answered</span>
                <span type="columnLine">him.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“It was stupid of me to be frightened.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">But we met so unexpectedly.”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Could I—I mean, would it be all right</span>
                <span type="columnLine">if I saw you home, Miss Carruthers?”</span>
                <span type="columnLine">asked the boy eagerly.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Betty hesitated. She had wanted to be</span>
                <span type="columnLine">alone. If this awkward lout insisted on</span>
                <span type="columnLine">talking to her, she knew she would go mad.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Still, it was late and she had quite some</span>
                <span type="columnLine">way to go.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Why yes,” she agreed reluctantly. “It</span>
                <span type="columnLine">would be very nice of you.”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">She remembered, now, the first time she</span>
                <span type="columnLine">had seen him. It had been during the final</span>
                <span type="columnLine">days of the football season. She had been</span>
                <span type="columnLine">watching the football practice, a lonely fig-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ure in the stands, and Gawky Carter had</span>
                <span type="columnLine">been playing end for the scrub team. A</span>
                <span type="columnLine">very poor end, at that. The regular squad</span>
                <span type="columnLine">had seemed to be able to score through his</span>
                <span type="columnLine">position almost at will—mainly because the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">lanky boy was so unbelievably awkward.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">He stumbled and fell, she remembered, all</span>
                <span type="columnLine">over the field. When his clumsiness was</span>
                <span type="columnLine">not removing him from a play, it seemed</span>
                <span type="columnLine">to interfere with one of his teammates.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Late in the practice session, with the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">scrubs in possession of the ball, he had</span>
                <span type="columnLine">managed, somehow or other, to receive an</span>
                <span type="columnLine">almost impossible forward pass from the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">scrub quarterback. A play that had aston-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ished even his teammates, for the ball had</span>
                <span type="columnLine">seemed to be far out of reach of any eligi-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ble receiver—but he had immediately pro-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ceeded to nullify his one spectacular play</span>
                <span type="columnLine">by driving headlong into a stone-wall de-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">fense that dropped him for a loss.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ONLY once, since then, had Betty even</span>
                <span type="columnLine">so much as glimpsed the gawky one.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Somewhat to her own surprise, she had</span>
                <span type="columnLine">seen him at a Student Mix in the Student</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Union Building. He had, as a matter of</span>
                <span type="columnLine">fact, danced with her once and now she</span>
                <span type="columnLine">recalled, briefly, her own mild astonishment</span>
                <span type="columnLine">that the lanky chap whose awkwardness</span>
                <span type="columnLine">had been so apparent on the football field</span>
                <span type="columnLine">was not at all a bad dancer. On the smooth</span>
                <span type="columnLine">polished boards of the dancing floor his</span>
                <span type="columnLine">clumsy length seemed to get new poise;</span>
                <span type="columnLine">BASKETBALL STORIES</span>
                <span type="columnLine">his awkwardness slipping away from him</span>
                <span type="columnLine">amazingly, and he moved to the music in</span>
                <span type="columnLine">perfect rhythm and timing.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">She stole a glance at him as he strode</span>
                <span type="columnLine">along beside her, silent in the frosty moon-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">light. He wasn’t a bad looking boy. Not</span>
                <span type="columnLine">handsome at all, of course. Perhaps even</span>
                <span type="columnLine">on the homely side, but a pleasant, frank</span>
                <span type="columnLine">kind of homeliness. For a moment she felt</span>
                <span type="columnLine">a pang of pity. After all, he was just a</span>
                <span type="columnLine">kid from the sticks. It was too bad he was</span>
                <span type="columnLine">so loutish on the gridiron. All he had was</span>
                <span type="columnLine">a pair of sure hands.</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">A gasp of shocked wonderment nearly</span>
                <span type="columnLine">passed her lips as suddenly there rung</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Betty turned to her silent partner sud-</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">The boy laughed a trifle grimly.</span>

                <span type="columnLine">onstrated more and more clearly that his</span>
                <span type="columnLine">feeling for her was something deeper than</span>
                <span type="columnLine">admiration.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">A CRISP footstep behind her roused</span>
                <span type="columnLine">her from her moody reverie. It was</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Hal Gordon himself. And even as he</span>
                <span type="columnLine">opened his mouth to speak, she knew that</span>
                <span type="columnLine">there was more trouble coming.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“I’ve been looking for you,” began Hal</span>
                <span type="columnLine">roughly. “I want to get this Gawky Car-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ter business straightened out once and for</span>
                <span type="columnLine">all. Just where he stands—and where I</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">And then Betty told him. Told him the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">whole story. How, in an effort to save</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Pop’s job, she had deliberately lured the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">clumsy boy into the one sport at which he</span>
                <span type="columnLine">was skilful. Gordon listened, unbeliev-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ingly at first, and then with growing amuse-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ment as she finished her explanation.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“—and so he’s playing now,” she con-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">cluded. “And with five good first-team</span>
                <span type="columnLine">men, Pop has every reason to hope for a</span>
                <span type="columnLine">championship year. That is, if you and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Carter will bring your feud to an end.”</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Gordon laughed buoyantly.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“I might have guessed. If I hadn’t been</span>
                <span type="columnLine">such a darned fool I would have known</span>
                <span type="columnLine">that a smart girl like you could never get</span>
                <span type="columnLine">really interested in a hayseed like Carter.”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Betty laughed weakly. To her own sur-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">prise, she felt a tug of resentment at Gor-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">don’s superior attitude. But it would be</span>
                <span type="columnLine">futile, now, to undo whatever good she had</span>
                <span type="columnLine">done.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“This is a howl on Gawky,” continued</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Gordon exhuberantly. “Well, the big sap</span>
                <span type="columnLine">asked for it. Let him stew in his own</span>
                <span type="columnLine">gravy. But mind you, young lady, after</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the season is over, you and I have a lot</span>
                <span type="columnLine">of making up for lost time to take care of.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">And until then—well, give the rube a good</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ride. He has it coming to him.”</span>
                <span type="columnLine">THAT night, for the first time since</span>

                <span type="columnLine">had developed into an important part of</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">He missed the gay laughter that was so</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Puzzled, he had dared at last to speak to</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">The girl’s eyes tried to meet his, then</span>
                <span type="columnLine">dropped. How could she tell him that it</span>
                <span type="columnLine">was not him but herself that she despised</span>
                <span type="columnLine">this evening ? His awkward but honest so-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">fires of recrimination burning within her.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">And suddenly Betty Carruthers realized</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">She saw him now, as for the first time,</span>

                <span type="columnLine">new note in her voice, a faint throbbing</span>
                <span type="columnLine">that brought an answering beat to Dan’s</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“No, it’s something I’ve done, Dan.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Something I wish I could do differently</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“What is it?” he asked gently. “Maybe</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">She shook her head blindly.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Dan, I’ve been so foolish. And I can’t</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">He looked at her long and searchingly;</span>

                <span type="columnLine">bench and watched as the Green Raiders</span>
                <span type="columnLine">of Midland swept into the final minutes of</span>
                <span type="columnLine">play with an overwhelming lead against</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">These past four games had convinced</span>

                <span type="columnLine">out convincing lickings to Weslayan, Craig</span>

                <span type="columnLine">anything but a win—would bring the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Green to the season’s halfway mark with</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">On the field, a machine-like quintet</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Grimly the squadsmen nodded. They</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">For no apparent reason, Gordon had un-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">dergone a swift and complete change. His</span>
                <span type="columnLine">manner now was distinctly cordial, even</span>
                <span type="columnLine">friendly. Sometimes, Dan thought with a</span>
                <span type="columnLine">faint groping doubt, just a shade too</span>
                <span type="columnLine">friendly. As though the other guard were</span>
                <span type="columnLine">in some subtle fashion mocking him. But</span>
                <span type="columnLine">in the face of Hal’s continued bluff hearti-</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Nothing important,” replied Carter.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">“A few studies to make up. But that won’t</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Well,” said Gordon casually, “I thought</span>

                <span type="columnLine">manage to drop over to the house for a</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Carter’s heart leaped. An invitation to</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the Phi Tau house. That could only mean</span>
                <span type="columnLine">one thing—that he was being considered</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Say, I’d like to,” he agreed quickly.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">“Any particular time?”</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Whenever you want to. Make it about</span>

                <span type="columnLine">on the big, lanky fellow’s face. This was</span>
                <span type="columnLine">all fixed with the boys at the house. They</span>
                <span type="columnLine">would take Carter for a ride so gently, so</span>

                <span type="columnLine">been on the pan until he found himself</span>
                <span type="columnLine">brown on one side. Or perhaps, Gordon</span>
                <span type="columnLine">thought amusedly, they could prolong the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">fun a little. Tease the kid along for a few</span>
                <span type="columnLine">weeks, until the basketball season was over,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">then give him the works.</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">But if Gordon’s intention was obscure to</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Carter, it was plain to Betty Carruthers.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">That afternoon, as she and the lanky guard</span>
                <span type="columnLine">strolled across the campus, she frowned at</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“I’m afraid I do realize what it means,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Dan. Only too well. Tell me, didn’t you</span>
                <span type="columnLine">have some trouble with Hal earlier in the</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Yes, but that’s all over now,” explained</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Carter. “These past few weeks he has</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Don’t, Dan!” begged the girl in a small</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“But it’s all your doing,” persisted</span>

                <span type="columnLine">competition will be remains to be seen. But</span>
                <span type="columnLine">there is little doubt that if the tournament</span>
                <span type="columnLine">is handled well, the national collegiate</span>
                <span type="columnLine">championships should, in time, develop into</span>
                <span type="columnLine">something akin to the World Series. How-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ever, we’ll know more about this matter</span>
                <span type="columnLine">next year.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">THERE has been only one important</span>
                <span type="columnLine">rule change this season, namely, the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">elimination of the center jump after a</span>
                <span type="columnLine">basket has been scored. This is a continu-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ation of the tendency which first expressed</span>
                <span type="columnLine">itself in the abolition of the center jump</span>
                <span type="columnLine">after a foul try has been successfully com-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">pleted. The new rule, which limits the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">center jump to the beginning of each half</span>
                <span type="columnLine">and held balls, was an attempt on the part</span>
                <span type="columnLine">of the governing body to give the small</span>
                <span type="columnLine">man a “break.” Hitherto, teams carried a</span>
                <span type="columnLine">human telephone pole as a center to gain</span>
                <span type="columnLine">possession of the ball for them. Now that,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">after a basket has been made, the ball will</span>
                <span type="columnLine">be given to the team scored against, the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">bean-pole loses much of his value and will</span>
                <span type="columnLine">probably be replaced by a somewhat</span>
                <span type="columnLine">smaller, faster man who can take an active</span>
                <span type="columnLine">part in the team’s offense. Thus the squads</span>
                <span type="columnLine">with comparatively small centers will have</span>
                <span type="columnLine">at least an even chance to maintain pos-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">session of the ball, which is rather impor-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">tant, because, after all, you can’t score</span>
                <span type="columnLine">while the opposition has the ball.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">For several years now, teams on the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">West Coast have been playing without the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">tip-off and it has been shown in actual com-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">petition that due to the fact that no time</span>
                <span type="columnLine">is lost in putting the ball in play as for-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">merly, the game is a much faster one and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">produces higher scoring contests. As much</span>
                <span type="columnLine">as six minutes of actual playing time is</span>
                <span type="columnLine">added to the contest. According to actual</span>
                <span type="columnLine">tests.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Another reason for the change was to</span>
                <span type="columnLine">eliminate the roughness incidental to the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">tip-off as the players attempted to gain</span>
                <span type="columnLine">possession of the flying sphere. In this</span>
                <span type="columnLine">way much fouling has been eliminated,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">which, again, is a factor in making the new</span>
                <span type="columnLine">game a speedier one. The results of the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">new change will, therefore, serve to make</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the game a more interesting one for the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">spectator. Play will now surge from one</span>
                <span type="columnLine">end of the court to the other without ces-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">sation. No longer will a team be able to</span>
                <span type="columnLine">monopolize possession of the ball because</span>
                <span type="columnLine">of its height. And a good, fast, small</span>
                <span type="columnLine">team will thus have an even chance to cut</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the opposition down to its size—for now</span>
                <span type="columnLine">it gets the ball at least half of the time.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">One further effect which the elimination</span>
                <span type="columnLine">of the tip-off will have is that the squads</span>
                <span type="columnLine">will now be numerically larger. Previ-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ously, due to the relaxation periods which</span>
                <span type="columnLine">occurred after the shooting of a basket,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">five men could play the entire game. Now,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">with the very essential rest eliminated,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">coaches will have to use more men to keep</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the game going at high speed. Thus, in</span>
                <span type="columnLine">a sense, basketball will no longer be a bat-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">tle between two five-man teams, but rather</span>
                <span type="columnLine">a contest between much larger squads. An</span>
                <span type="columnLine">important point to consider is that coaches</span>

                <span type="columnLine">the zone-defense, because it is less wear-</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">However, a zone defense nullifies “cut-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ting” and causes the offense to rely on</span>

                <span type="columnLine">cordingly, the spectators may lose one of</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the greatest thrills in the game—a sudden</span>

                <span type="columnLine">a basket scored from close-up. Sentiment</span>
                <span type="columnLine">against the zone defense is increasing for</span>
                <span type="columnLine">this very reason. Coaches, players, and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">spectators would not like to see games de-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">generate into set-shooting contests. But</span>
                <span type="columnLine">they are continually being forced to adopt</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the zone, since the rules give that type of</span>
                <span type="columnLine">defense an advantage. I myself, strongly</span>
                <span type="columnLine">opposed to the zone in principle because it</span>
                <span type="columnLine">nullifies speed afoot and shrewd screen-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ing tactics, am therefore forced to use it.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">The zone defense permits a slow man to</span>
                <span type="columnLine">play because he can “get by” on the at-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">tack if he is a smooth ball handler, and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">on the defense he does not have to move</span>
                <span type="columnLine">too rapidly. It is fairly obvious that when</span>
                <span type="columnLine">you can use a slower man, the game must</span>
                <span type="columnLine">be slowing down. Thus, one of the chief</span>
                <span type="columnLine">charms of basketball—its speed and fire—</span>
                <span type="columnLine">may be partly diminished.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">I believe that in the East, sentiment</span>
                <span type="columnLine">against the zone will increase with particu-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">lar vehemence in the next season or so.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Such a reaction would be based on the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">fact that the East has just adopted the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">interpretation of the “screening” rule</span>
                <span type="columnLine">which has been used throughout most of</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the nation, namely, that a player is en-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">titled to his position on the floor. This</span>
                <span type="columnLine">principle permits much more body contact</span>
                <span type="columnLine">than Easterners have been accustomed to.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Also, it facilitates matters for the offen-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">be “screened” off from the man he is</span>
                <span type="columnLine">guarding. In an effort to counteract this</span>
                <span type="columnLine">many Eastern teams will adopt the zone</span>
                <span type="columnLine">defense because in such a defense, there is</span>
                <span type="columnLine">no need to “switch” after a “screen” has</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">I am convinced that a clamor against the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">zone will arise when it becomes perfectly</span>

                <span type="columnLine">of basketball a set-shooting contest, which</span>
                <span type="columnLine">cannot possibly have the wide spectator or</span>

                <span type="columnLine">In support of this contention, I should like</span>

                <span type="columnLine">pleasing the spectator, has long prohibited</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the use of this defense. However, since</span>

                <span type="columnLine">nice as she was pretty. They were in the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">same chemistry class and Steve had come</span>
                <span type="columnLine">to know her well. He was in love with her</span>
                <span type="columnLine">but that was his secret and he guarded it</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Hello, Mr. Martin,” Mary said as she</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">That was just like Mary, Steve reflected.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">She was one of the few students on the</span>

                <span type="columnLine">and called him ‘“Mister” instead of “Pop.”</span>

                <span type="columnLine">denly felt like water. She always affected</span>
                <span type="columnLine">him that way. Every time he heard her</span>
                <span type="columnLine">husky voice, or looked into her brown</span>
                <span type="columnLine">eyes, smelled the sweet fragrance of her</span>
                <span type="columnLine">hair or the perfume she used, he felt a</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Steve,” she said, putting a hand lightly</span>
                <span type="columnLine">on his arm. “Won’t you take me to the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">party tonight?”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Steve looked at her uneasily. “What</span>
                <span type="columnLine">party?” he asked.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Why, the one they’re giving for the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">team,” she said. “You know. Up at the</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Steve shook his head. “No, I don’t</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">He saw the red flush stealing into her</span>
                <span type="columnLine">cheeks, the sudden anger glinting in her</span>
                <span type="columnLine">eyes. He remembered now having heard</span>
                <span type="columnLine">King Davis telling them after the game</span>
                <span type="columnLine">that they could sit up a little later than</span>
                <span type="columnLine">usual tonight if they promised not to break</span>
                <span type="columnLine">training otherwise. There had been a de-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">lay in the tournament schedule and the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">committee had found it necessary to put</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the final game off until Monday night. The</span>
                <span type="columnLine">team had come through a hard season, and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">King was wise enough to let them ease up.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">“Wait here,” Mary said, her voice throb-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">bing with rage. “Don’t go away, please.”</span>
                <span type="columnLine">S'he started to go in, but Steve caught</span>
                <span type="columnLine">her by the arm. “No,” he said. “Don’t.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">I’d rather not go that way.”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Don’t be silly,” she cried. “Glenn only</span>
                <span type="columnLine">forgot. I’ll be right back.”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">She was gone before he could stop her.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">He saw her cross the floor and talk earnestly</span>
                <span type="columnLine">with Glenn Howard. Steve felt like a fool.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">But it was nice, he thought, to have Mary</span>
                <span type="columnLine">interested in him, to have her want him to</span>
                <span type="columnLine">take her to the party. Then he saw her</span>
                <span type="columnLine">coming back, Glenn Howard in tow.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Hello, Pop,” the big center called as he</span>
                <span type="columnLine">swaggered out onto the porch. “How’s</span>
                <span type="columnLine">tricks?” He swung around on Steve be-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">fore the elder Martin could reply. “Mary</span>
                <span type="columnLine">says I forgot to ask you to the party to-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">night. Guess it slipped my mind, but you’d</span>
                <span type="columnLine">better come. It’s informal, so don’t bother</span>
                <span type="columnLine">to change your clothes.”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">And with that he spun on his heel and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">re-entered the gymnasium. Mary stared</span>
                <span type="columnLine">after him, her small fists clenching at her</span>
                <span type="columnLine">sides. Steve’s own fists were crammed</span>
                <span type="columnLine">into his pockets where he could control</span>
                <span type="columnLine">them. Steve knew that it hadn’t “slipped”</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Howard’s mind. He had excluded Steve</span>
                <span type="columnLine">deliberately from the party. And that</span>
                <span type="columnLine">crack about not bothering to change his</span>
                <span type="columnLine">clothes. Glenn Howard knew very well</span>
                <span type="columnLine">that the best Steve had was on his back at</span>
                <span type="columnLine">that moment.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“I can’t understand how some people</span>
                <span type="columnLine">can be that way,” Mary said tonelessly. She</span>
                <span type="columnLine">turned with a toss of her dark curls and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">took Steve and his father each by an arm.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">“But what do we care ? The car’s out there</span>
                <span type="columnLine">somewhere. Let’s be going.”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">As they drove away from the gymna-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">Howard coming down the steps with some</span>
                <span type="columnLine">of his friends. They were laughing at</span>
                <span type="columnLine">something he was telling them and Steve</span>
                <span type="columnLine">guessed what it was.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Mary parked her roadster in front of the</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“I’ve got to make a round of the fur-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">when you get ready to go home.”</span>
                <span type="columnLine">THE party was well under way when</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Steve and Mary got there. Steve</span>
                <span type="columnLine">helped Mary out of her coat and hung it</span>
                <span type="columnLine">beside his on a peg in the hall. A stair</span>
                <span type="columnLine">led up from the hallway into the upper</span>
                <span type="columnLine">stories of the old brick and frame house.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Steve glanced into the library to his right</span>
                <span type="columnLine">and beyond that to the dining-room. Then</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Mary led him into the sitting-room on the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">left. It was a huge room, richly furnished</span>
                <span type="columnLine">with sofas, chairs, rugs and paper on the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">walls. Steve had never seen such rugs</span>
                <span type="columnLine">before. They were soft and deep under-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">foot. Mentally he compared these things</span>
                <span type="columnLine">with the cold linoleum and the unplastered</span>
                <span type="columnLine">walls he was accustomed to at home.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Leading Steve to a sofa, Mary sat down</span>
                <span type="columnLine">beside him. The room was almost full. At</span>
                <span type="columnLine">one end the rug had been pulled back and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">an energetic couple were wildly dancing to</span>
                <span type="columnLine">music pounded out by a bespectacled, chin-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">less youth who sat hunched over a piano</span>
                <span type="columnLine">GANGWAY FOR GLORY 73</span>
                <span type="columnLine">in the corner. On a sideboard were glasses,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ice-bucket and a row of bottles. Smoke</span>
                <span type="columnLine">curled up from a score of cigarettes. The</span>
                <span type="columnLine">rug was pushed back further and more</span>
                <span type="columnLine">couples went out on the floor. Then Baldy</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Jones asked Mary to dance, and Steve was</span>
                <span type="columnLine">left alone.</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Steve wished that he could have been</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the one to ask her, but he didn’t dance well</span>
                <span type="columnLine">and he hadn’t dared. For twenty minutes</span>
                <span type="columnLine">he sat there on the sofa by himself. No</span>
                <span type="columnLine">one spoke to him. No one paid him any</span>
                <span type="columnLine">attention other than to glance at him with</span>
                <span type="columnLine">a look that plainly said, “What do you</span>
                <span type="columnLine">think you’re doing here?” Steve felt out</span>
                <span type="columnLine">of place. And he was out of place, he real-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ized, suddenly wishing that he hadn’t</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Steve saw Glenn Howard come in a</span>
                <span type="columnLine">short while later and take a whiskey bottle</span>
                <span type="columnLine">and glass from the sideboard. Steve</span>
                <span type="columnLine">frowned, wondering whether the basket-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">Howard disappeared for several minutes,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">then came back, minus glass and with the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">bottle half empty. Leaning against the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">sideboard he looked around the room, his</span>
                <span type="columnLine">gaze finally settling on Steve. There was</span>
                <span type="columnLine">a covert smile on his dark, handsome face.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">He seemed to be amused by something he</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Steve saw him leave the room and re-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">turn twice more in the next fifteen minutes.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Then he forgot all about it when Mary</span>

                <span type="columnLine">now where his father had been getting his</span>

                <span type="columnLine">giving it to him. Steve was certain of</span>
                <span type="columnLine">that. He was certain because he knew</span>
                <span type="columnLine">that his father didn’t leave work here on</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the campus until eleven o’clock, after he</span>

                <span type="columnLine">the nights that he had come home drunk</span>
                <span type="columnLine">he had been in the River Street house by</span>

                <span type="columnLine">for the trip into town on the bus. He had</span>

                <span type="columnLine">and beating time to the music with his</span>

                <span type="columnLine">of knuckles meeting bone was like a pistol</span>
                <span type="columnLine">shot in the tense stillness. Glenn Howard</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">But he made no move to get up and re-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">smile twitching the corners of his mouth,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Steve took his father by the arm and led</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">They drove the two miles to town in</span>

                <span type="columnLine">mumbling and chuckling to himself, head</span>

                <span type="columnLine">other side Steve could feel Mary’s slim</span>

                <span type="columnLine">pulled up to the curb on River Street, Steve</span>
                <span type="columnLine">helped his father out, then turned back to</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Mary. She was leaning across the front</span>
                <span type="columnLine">seat, one hand on the wheel. Steve put</span>
                <span type="columnLine">his head in the window to thank her for</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the lift home.</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“I’m sorry, Steve,” she said before he</span>

                <span type="columnLine">Glenn is, too. He should be whipped if</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Steve felt her hand on his cheek, saw</span>
                <span type="columnLine">her face drawing close to his. A pair of</span>
                <span type="columnLine">warm lips touched his. Then she was gone</span>
                <span type="columnLine">and he was left standing on the sidewalk</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Dazed, Steve took his father into the</span>

                <span type="columnLine">down in his cold bedroom to think over</span>
                <span type="columnLine">what had happened. It was all a muddle</span>
                <span type="columnLine">in Steve’s brain. He recalled the game</span>

                <span type="columnLine">That was like a nightmare to him. He</span>
                <span type="columnLine">closed his eyes then and thought of Mary</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Wood’s kiss, how sweet and tender it had</span>
                <span type="columnLine">been, and a faint smile softened the harsh</span>

                <span type="columnLine">merely felt sorry for him and taken this</span>
                <span type="columnLine">way of saying it. Steve was grateful. But</span>
                <span type="columnLine">his mind was made up when he finally went</span>

                <span type="columnLine">AS he went to the bench Andy thought</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ruefully that it would be easy to set-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">be settled out of hand. If Danver won</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Tip would find some way to steal the credit</span>

                <span type="columnLine">that one. Abe Skivak’s block on Kamp</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Yes,” Lash nodded toward the door.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">“Gave the dope to Miss—er—Cavan. Nice</span>

                <span type="columnLine">“Oh,” Lash nodded. Hurriedly he in-</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Yep. Come on.” Disston led the way</span>
                <span type="columnLine">from the administration building. The</span>
                <span type="columnLine">two emerged on a wide walk, and headed</span>
                <span type="columnLine">for the gymnasium. A pair of strolling</span>
                <span type="columnLine">students hailed Disston, stopped to stare</span>
                <span type="columnLine">at Lash. The guard returned the salutes,</span>
                <span type="columnLine">and grinned at his companion. “You’re</span>
                <span type="columnLine">quite a freak, Lash,” he remarked. “Cam-</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Neither,” Lash retorted. “Of course,</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“N-no. Just to fill out the squad, I</span>

                <span type="columnLine">Then he plunged ahead. “Well, I guess all</span>
                <span type="columnLine">you fellows know. He said he wanted me</span>
                <span type="columnLine">to show off last night to remind the whole</span>
                <span type="columnLine">squad that practice makes perfect. I hope</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">me,” Disston assured him.</span>
                <span type="columnLine">l&gt;l“Of course, it might be—well, a</span>
                <span type="columnLine">little bit different with Edwards and Por-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">“It was the floor,” Lash explained pa-</span>
                <span type="columnLine">tiently. “I was used to it—sweeping up</span>
                <span type="columnLine">ever since they finished it. And you wore</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Yeah,” Disston agreed dubiously. “But</span>
                <span type="columnLine">the boys are taking an awful ribbing.” He</span>
                <span type="columnLine">gave Lash a sidelong look. “Er—while</span>

                <span type="columnLine">Lash stared ahead as he walked, and</span>
                <span type="columnLine">said evenly, “No, not a bit. After all,</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Disston laughed. “Right spirit. Going</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">They reached the gymnasium, entered a</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Lash flushed, but met the curious stares</span>
                <span type="columnLine">with unconcern. Disston showed him a</span>

                <span type="columnLine">announced “This is sub country hereabout.”</span>
                <span type="columnLine">He indicated the double row of lockers</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">A whistle blew, and Lash hurriedly</span>

                <span type="columnLine">in one corner, chatting as they waited for</span>
                <span type="columnLine">a ball. Brill saw Lash, and beckoned him</span>

                <span type="columnLine">it up, saw glances directed at Lash, but</span>
                <span type="columnLine">said nothing. Lash caught the next pass</span>
                <span type="columnLine">and hurried the ball along with a two-hand</span>
                <span type="columnLine">shove. At once a twinge traveled up his</span>

                <span type="columnLine">arms. Meek sprang to screen him, but</span>
                <span type="columnLine">Porter flashed past on a dribble. Halfway</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“They look good, don’t they?” Randall</span>

                <span type="columnLine">Ben thought a basket must surely result.</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Once Young secured possession of the</span>

                <span type="columnLine">SLOWLY he would dribble to the mid-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">take deliberate aim and start the ball on an</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Sometimes in the heat of the game Ben</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">But Young would only smile, a light,</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">But dissension was bound to make its</span>

                <span type="columnLine">when four of the squad, Harter and King,</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Ben looked up in surprise at their ap-</span>

                <span type="columnLine">through his body and drew his features</span>
                <span type="columnLine">into a worried frown. The faces of the</span>
                <span type="columnLine">four men were grim. Their lips were set.</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Ben stood up and looked steadily from</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“That’s a threat, Harter. Why don’t</span>
                <span type="columnLine">you go to coach direct?”</span>
            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Ackerman wouldn’t listen to us. You’re</span>
                <span type="columnLine">playing with us on the same team. You</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Ben coaxed them to stay. He pleaded</span>

                <span type="columnLine">and the others refused to budge. At last</span>
                <span type="columnLine">he lost his temper and burst out in a low,</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“You guys are not only yellow, you’re</span>

                <span type="columnLine">THE coach entered the dressing-room</span>
                <span type="columnLine">at this moment and sidled over to the</span>

                <span type="columnLine">with the calling down he had just given the</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">Before anyone had a chance to speak</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">He was cool, calculating, almost cynical,</span>

                <span type="columnLine">shorter by two inches and slenderer, was</span>
                <span type="columnLine">impulsive. His regular features tightened,</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Young, answer me this question. Why</span>

            <ab><span type="columnLine">“Why, I don’t mind telling you,” Young</span>
                <span type="columnLine">said. He almost drawled his words. “I</span>
                <span type="columnLine">take most of the shots because this year I</span>

            </ab>
            <ab><span type="columnLine">Ben knew the guard had spoken the</span>
