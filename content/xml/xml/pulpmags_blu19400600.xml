            <seg type="columnLine">wildly. No doubt he was screaming</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As if the feeble sound of a human voice</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">when that ninth sea toppled over. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">swamped him. When it cleared he was</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">HE struggled--but not for long. Soon</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The wind was higher now, lifting its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">voice. The seas beyond the dissipating</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rolling toward us, livid lightning flaming</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along the craggy clouds of storm. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew what it meant. That shrill scream</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was crescendoing. There wasn't much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time left to maneuver; to reclaim a boat;</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> So Sammy Yardabout reached for his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gesture with his upflung arm to tell the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Yardabout could face what was left</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">SO our boat came home without him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">What else could the chief mate do?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Somehow or another we hooked it on and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lifted it aboard. Then we looked back,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when there was time. All of us. To</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">lent man. Why not ? I know to my eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was very plain--like a sight of some-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ing light before utter darkness comes,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and therefore forever after remembered.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Just before the great squall struck we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw him with that clarity. A figure half</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prone on the deck of a sinking hulk with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the seas leaping up all around and the</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He must have heard the first high</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whistling squeal of hurricane, because he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned his head as if to listen, or maybe</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just to smile at it with slow serenity. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">meant to tell it lie was ready; he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">waited long enough. Just then that Ship</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took a monstrous lurch. Suddenly she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flung her counter free of foam. Her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">name leaped up. It leaped up into mo-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mentary vision like a living thing want-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing to make itself known before oblivion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came. Nirobe! No wonder Typhoon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sammy stayed! He was the same man.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was the same ship. Perhaps it was the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">solent challenge on its own shrewd terms,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">probably blessed great good fortune such</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as that. Because I tell you he had his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he had got it lit. And he meant to sit</seg>
