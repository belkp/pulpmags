            <seg type="columnLine">the next time he was in Chicago. In those days each engi-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to take very good care of it. Some even spent their own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">money putting on extra brass plating. One engineer, whom I'll call Jim Turcell, was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">operating a regular passenger run out of Chicago with No. 92. His pride in this loco-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">motive was his besetting sin. Being a wealthy man, he could afford to lavish a great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">amount of money dolling her up. Wherever possible, he installed brass and even paid</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the fact they had more brass to polish than the firemen of the other lines, which duty</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">required three to four hours before leaving on their runs. The superintendent then sug-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">violence to obtain the coat and bag if</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">allow the dick to see him catch the fast</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The light on the approaching engine</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">where the train would pass. Now it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was simply a matter of timing. He</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Finally Benny made a dash across</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">turned to shape in a lathe. Cab, tender,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">etc., were made of 16 gage sheet steel,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while cylinders, domes and stacks were cast</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of aluminum. Drive wheels were cast of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brass at a nearby foundry from patterns I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The locomotive is 5' 2" long, 10" high</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by 7" wide. She runs on a track 3*4" wide,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about a %" scale. She has a polarity relay</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">reversing the track polarity at some point</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the system.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> My first thought was that if I could make</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the drive wheels I could easily do the rest.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Of course, they could be purchased, but I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">preferred to build my own. Therefore, I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">made up a set of patterns of aluminum by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">first turning out 2 discs on a lathe 3" in dia.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">These discs were flat on one side, the other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">side being tapered down from the center</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until within 3/16" of the outer edge. This</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gave the correct shape for the rim. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">finished pattern is W" in thickness.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Next place the surfaces of the discs to-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gether, and dowel-pin, so that the finished</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pattern can be taken apart in 2 halves.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mark out for the spokes, counter-weights</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and crank pin. Drill between the spokes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and work them out with a small file. It is not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strenuous work, as aluminum cuts easily.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Cut out the pieces and pin on to make the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hub and counter-weights stand out. Coun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ter-weights must be fastened on so they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">can be removed, as different sized ones must</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be used for main drivers, etc. All parts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">must taper from the middle to the outside</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of each half of the wheel, so it will draw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out of the moulding sand readily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> I now had a set of drive wheel patterns</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which any foundry could cast from. My</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wheels are made of tough brass, and shrunk</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the steel tires.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Next I made the frame. As Mallets have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a hinge in the frame it was necessary to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make it in 2 sections. These sections differ</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">somewhat. The front section carries the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">low-pressure cylinders, pilot beam, coupler</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and pony truck on the front end. The back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">section has the high-pressure cylinders on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the front end and the trailer on the rear.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Trailers are generally made as a separate</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unit, but I made this one rigid with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">main frame. This method proves satisfac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tory. My frame is made the same as the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">real ones and has journal boxes for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drivers. I took 1 V4" x %" steel bar and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">marked out the frames. By drilling and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">filing out the openings for the boxes and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Next came the cylinders. They were cast</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from aluminum. Aluminum is good for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">model making. It can be melted in most</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any coal range or furnace. When melted it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is easy to handle. Make any mould or form</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from sheet and pour in the metal. It is not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bad about leaking out, and after cool, peel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">off the sheet iron and you have a very nice</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">casting. Domes and stack can be made in</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> After the cylinders were mounted came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the boiler. This was made from a piece of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">4" pipe turned to shape in the lathe on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drum end and fitted with a sheet-iron back</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">16 gage. Some may have difficulty in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">working sheet metal, so let me say that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sheet metal is placed between them and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clamped in a vise. With a little practice</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it is easy to flange, bend, stretch or work</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the metal in most any form.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now mount the boiler, after which one is</seg>
