            <seg type="columnLine">Water was her main anxiety. The supply</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his career were diametrically opposed. Also things were complicated by the fact that Bill had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brought home a college friend, Pete Stearns, a practical joker of great genius, who, being of a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">August, 1587. Her grandfather, John White, the governor of the colony, sailed for England</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a few days after her birth. When he returned to Virginia a year later the colonists had disap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">peared ; the only trace of their destination being the word " Croatan "--a place supposed to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">belong to a friendly tribe of Indians--carved on the trunk of a tree. There was no sign of a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">JOHN AXSON, a young man of extraordinary strength of both body and mind, but exceedingly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ugly, had been taken from his. tenement home and his tubercular mother and his thieving</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">father, as a little child, and trained and educated at the expense of James Gordon Windsor 3rd.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Windsor had sent for Axson, and for the first time in his life he looked upon the face of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the man to whom he owed a debt of gratitude which hurt him like hot iron. Windsor explained</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he had reached the end of his financial string, and was soon to cross the border. No</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Windsor had ever worked, and his son, James, had been bred in the tradition of wealth and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">culture. But he had selected and educated Axson to supply his son with funds to continue to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">live in the style to which he had been accustomed. When James Gordon Windsor 4th made a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">profitable marriage the connection could be terminated. His benefactor explained to Axson that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">under the circumstances of his birth he would certainly have become a thief, and he had merely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">provided that he could steal with security. However, just as he himself could never knowingly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have lived on stolen goods, so neither could his son. He bound Axson never to reveal to young</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Windsor the source of his income. But the old man desired that the two lads should live</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">together after his death. Young Windsor, a typical spendthrift of the city, harmless and good-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">natured, was both attracted and repulsed by Axson. However, they made a manage together,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Axson was at once confronted with Windsor's need of money after his father's self-inflicted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">death.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Having proved his physical prowess in a boxing bout with Windsor, the latter was immensely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attracted to Axson, and Axson in turn, for the first time in his life, was brought within the radius</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of human companionship and human friendship. Axson had to plunder, but he would plunder</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the sake of another.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Regaining consciousness, Windsor reached his locker and there found a note from Axson saying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he would be at the flat the next day with the money for the Leffingwell debt.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the strength of a newspaper account of the McIntosh diamond robbery, Axson went to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">call at the shop of Ainsmith &amp; Faulkner, from whose safe the gems had been stolen. The robbers</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had left a note signed with the mysterious signature of the XXX, the sign manual of a famous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gang of thieves who, for five years, had operated without a single member falling into the clutches</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the law.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The same evening Axson called at a quiet house on Fifty-Seventh Street, where he had an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">interview with three men, Volner, Norton, and Louis Masters. Nonplused at his demands, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nevertheless complied by handing over forty thousand dollars in cash for the McIntosh diamonds,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which he gave them. Before their wonder ceased, Gordon, their confidential man, was brought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in, bloody and battered.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When Windsor became anxious over his financial state, Axson advised him to go in for an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heiress, promising him twenty thousand dollars for his campaign. He also advised Bacon, their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">new butler, that his picture was kept at the Rogues' Gallery, that he came from Volner, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">carried a gun. He got Bacon's promise to be his man.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">After three days absence, Windsor came to Axson and reported he had fallen desperately in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">love with Elizabeth Dorn. He could not press his suit because her engagement to a brilliant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">young man of leisure, Louis Masters, was to be announced in three hours. Mrs. Dorn had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">engaged to young Masters's father, but had dropped him because he had come to the house</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intoxicated. All Dorn women hated drink. After his father's death, young Masters had been at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">home in the Dorn household, and this engagement would consummate Mrs. Dorn's lifetime</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ambition. The young man was crazy about the girl, but she was still indifferent to all men.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Her emotions had never been aroused. Axson assured Windsor in three hours societ*' would know</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the private engagement of Louis Masters and Elizabeth had been broken.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Axson went at once to Masters's apartment. After chugging the man with whiskey they started</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the Dorn place on Long Island. Arrived there, Axson sent his man into the house and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hid in a kind of grotto. While watching the house, a door opened into the grotto and Axson</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">encountered a beautiful young woman, whom he felt had, at the same time as she entered his</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Axson spoke to the woman and calmed her fears, though he confessed he was a fugitive. She</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then he returned to the apartment, where Windsor found him on his return from the Dorn</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">l he rooms and announced to Mrs. Dprn he was repaying his father's debt by breaking his engage-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Masters sought sanctuary in the house of Martha Perce, whom he tried to convince he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">broken with the Dorns to resume his old partnership with her. He explained his burning passion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for Axson's death and asked the woman's aid. His intensity of hatred led the woman to think</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Dorn girl was in some way mixed up with Axson.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Windsor, in a wild intoxication of summer madness, had proposed to Elizabeth and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">got his dismissal. Axson urged him to write a letter, and himself composed the document.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Windsor was loath to use another man's burning words to persuade her, and called it stolen fire,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but in the end was persuaded.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">^ In the middle of the night Axson woke to find a person in his room. The light disclosed a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had been sent by Masters, but he could not guess the tale the woman told was acting to arouse</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his sympathies. Martha Perce got him to confess he was moved to pity for the first time in</seg>
