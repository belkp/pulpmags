Y. </p><p>Extravagant Fiction Today.......Cold Fact Tomorrow </p><p> IMAGINATION AND REALITY</p><p> By HUGO GERNSBACK</p><p>HEN reading one of our scientifiction </p><p>stories in which the author gives free </p><p>rein to his imagination, providing he is </p><p>a good story teller, we not infrequently </p><p>find ourselves deeply thrilled. The rea- </p><p>son is that our imagination is fired to </p><p>the nth degree, and we thus obtain a reat-satisfaction </p><p>from the time spent in reading the story, improbable </p><p>as it often appears at first. I should like to point out </p><p>here how important this class of literature is to </p><p>progress and to the race in general. </p><p> The human mind is a tremendously complex ma-</p><p>chine, which often works in a very strange manner. </p><p>A man sets out to invent a certain house appliance, </p><p>and while engaged in his experimental work, gets a </p><p>certain stimulus that takes him in an entirely differ- </p><p>ent direction, so that the first thought of the house </p><p>appliance may end in the invention of a factory </p><p>labor-saving device, or perhaps something even more </p><p>important. </p><p> When Alexander Graham Bell was a young man,</p><p>he occupied himself by devising means of enabling </p><p>the deaf to hear. This led him into electrical re- </p><p>search work, and the apparatus, far from becoming </p><p>a device by which the deaf can hear, became the pres- </p><p>ent telephone. To be sure, loud-speaking telephones </p><p>are made today for the use of the deaf, but this is </p><p>only a by-product and not at all the actual and more </p><p>important use of the instrument. </p><p> Hundreds and thousands of similar instances</p><p>could be cited. An author, in one of his fantastic </p><p>scientifiction stories, may start some one thinking </p><p>along the suggested lines which the author had in </p><p>mind, whereas the inventor in the end will finish up </p><p>with something totally different, and perhaps much </p><p>more important. But the fact remains that the au-</p><p>thor provided the stimulus in the first place, which </p><p>is a most important function to perform. </p><p> On the other hand, many devices predicted by</p><p>scientifiction authors have literally come true for </p><p>many generations. There is an old popular saying </p><p>that what man imagines, man can accomplish. This </p><p>proverb of course, should be taken with a grain of </p><p>salt, because not everything that man imagines is </p><p>possible. For instance, I can imagine that I blow </p><p>out the sun, or grasp the moon in my hand, or cut </p><p>off my head without dying. Naturally such things </p><p>are impossible. On the other hand, many of the so- </p><p>called wild ideas which we read in our scientifiction </p><p>stories may prove to be not quite so wild if they give </p><p>an actual stimulus to some inventor or inventor-to- </p><p>be who reads the story. And as long as there is a </p><p>stimulus of any sort, we have no reason to complain, </p><p>because we never realize where progress in any di-* </p><p>rection may lead us. </p><p> There is the well-known story of the inventor who</p><p>had patented a mouse-trap, and finally sold the pat- </p><p>ent to a manufacturer, who found that an excellent </p><p>burglar alarm could be made from the mouse-trap, </p><p>with but a few changes. Another case of an original </p><p>stimulus which, perhaps, went wrong, but finally </p><p>became righted. </p><p> We should not, therefore, become too impatient if</p><p>occasionally we encounter a seemingly impossible </p><p>prediction or improbable plot. It is beyond our pow- </p><p>er to foresee what reaction this may produce in </p><p>some one, and what tremendous consequences it may </p><p>have in the future. And, strange to relate, the pa- </p><p>tent offices of most countries follow scientifiction </p><p>stories pretty closely, because in many of these the </p><p>germ of an invention is hidden. It is not necessary </p><p>to actually build a model to be an inventor; often it </p><p>becomes necessary, for court proceedings and for </p><p>patent reasons, to find out who really was the orig- </p><p>inal inventor of a certain device; if the inventor is </p><p>an author who brought out the device, even in a fic- </p><p>tion story, this would, in the long run, entitle him to </p><p>ownership of the patent, always providing that the </p><p>device is carefully described, as to its functions, its </p><p>purpose and so forth. </p><p> For instance, in the United States, the inventor</p><p>would have two years from the publication of the </p><p>story to apply for a patent. Thus it will be seen that </p><p>a scientifiction story should not be taken too lightly, </p><p>and should not be classed just as literature. Far </p><p>from it. It actually helps in the progress of the </p><p>world, if ever so little, and the fact remains that it </p><p>contributes something to progress that probably no </p><p>other kind of literature does.</p><p>Mr. Hugo Gemsback speaks every Monday at 9 P.

Lyman </p><p>BEFORE giving this really marvelous tale to </p><p>the world, I feel that it is important to offer </p><p>a few lines of explanation, as well as a brief </p><p>sketch or synopsis of the events that led to my dis- </p><p>covery of the manuscript relating the incredible ad- </p><p>ventures of this writer. </p><p> As a fiaturalist specializing in ornithology, I had</p><p>long been attracted to the regions of the little </p><p>known Antarctic as a rich field for my studies. Very </p><p>largely, perhaps, my interest in Antarctic ornith- </p><p>ology was due to the fact that I resided in New Bed- </p><p>ford, a town famous in former years for the number </p><p>of its whaling vessels, many of which sailed an- </p><p>nually for the southern oceans in search of sea-ele- </p><p>phant oil. From the officers of theae vessels I </p><p>obtained many specimens of birds' skins and eggs </p><p>brought back by the obliging whalemen. Such </p><p>specimens were, however, more or less unsatisfac- </p><p>tory for scientific study, and I at last made up my </p><p>mind to visit the Antarctic in person in order to </p><p>observe and study that avifauna in its own habitat., </p><p> It thus happened that I secured passage upon a</p><p>whaleship bound for the South Atlantic and South </p><p>Indian oceans, and, after an uneventful voyage of </p><p>several months, I found myself gazing from the </p><p>bark’s deck at the frowning mountain peaks of </p><p>Kerguelen, or as it is also called, Desolation Island. </p><p> Here, in company with some ten of the bark’s</p><p>crew, I was landed, and, having been amply sup- </p><p>plied with provisions, tools and implements of the </p><p>whalemen’s trade, we saw the vessel sail away for </p><p>South Georgia, there to land other parties, which, </p><p>like our own, would remain upon the barren bits of </p><p>land until the bark’s return the following year. </p><p> I need not enter into a description of the wonder-</p><p>ful fauna and flora of the island, nor need I dilate </p><p>upon the rare and interesting specimens which re-j </p><p>warded my daily tramps over the bare basaltic hills </p><p>or through the thick scrub and rank grass of the </p><p>valleys, although to me those days were filled with </p><p>fascination and all the naturalist’s enthusiasm at </p><p>treading new fields of study. </p><p> Suffice it to state that on one misty morning, hav-</p><p>ing penetrated far into the interior of the island </p><p>in search of a new rookery of albatross, I was( </p><p>attracted by the strange behavior of one of these </p><p>great birds. </p><p> He appeared unable to rise from the ground, al-</p><p>though he repeatedly spread his immense wings and </p><p>flapped upward for a few inches. But each time </p><p>he fell back and struggled awkwardly about upon </p><p>the earth. </p><p> My nearer approach disclosed the fact that the</p><p>bird’s legs was entangled in some object among the </p><p>rocks, and, walking to within a few yards of the </p><p>albatross, I was surprised to find that a cord or line </p><p>was attached to the bird’s leg, while the other </p><p>extremity of the cord was fastened to an object </p><p>that glittered curiously in the light. </p><p> Consumed with curiosity, for I knew that no</p><p>human beings had recently visited the spot, I cau- </p><p>tiously approached the albatross, and, throwing my </p><p>coat over its head, I stooped and endeavored to dis- </p><p>engage the line from the bird’s leg. I found how- </p><p>ever, that the cord, which was of a most unusual </p><p>metallic lustre, was spliced or woven about the leg. </p><p> I therefore drew my sailor’s sheath knife and</p><p>strove to cut the line which was scarcely larger </p><p>than twine. Imagine if you can my surprise when </p><p>the keen-edged blade slipped uselessly along the </p><p>cord as though the knife had been of wood and the </p><p>line of steel! </p><p> Judging that the affair was some form of wire</p><p>rope, I then placed it across a small rock and ham- </p><p>mered it with another stone, but without avail. </p><p>Bending it rapidly back and forth was equally </p><p>futile, and I therefore turned my attention to the </p><p>object to which the cord was attached, and which </p><p>appeared to be a thin glass cylinder some two </p><p>inches in diameter and approximately six inches </p><p>in length. Through the crystal I could discern a </p><p>roll of some material resembling paper, and, feeling </p><p>sure that this was a message of some sort, I struck </p><p>the bottle-like receptacle a smart blow with a bit </p><p>of rock. I remember that, even as I did so, I was </p><p>mentally wondering how such a fragile receptacle </p><p>had escaped annihilation during the rough usage </p><p>to which it must have been subjected by its winged </p><p>carrier, but even this vague thought did not prepare </p><p>me for the result of my blow. Indeed, I cannot </p><p>adequately transcribe my utter amazement as the </p><p>stone rebounded from the glass container without </p><p>leaving so much as a scratch or a crack upon the </p><p>surface! </p><p> I was in fact, absolutely dumfounded. Eagerly</p><p>I stooped, and eXaminined the strange object more </p><p>closely and minutely. I discovered a small catch </p><p>or button near one end of the cylinder, and as I </p><p>pressed upon this, the cord was suddenly released. </p><p> With the cylinder now in my possession I gave</p><p>no further heed to the albatross, which immediately </p><p>flew off, a most regrettable incident as he carried </p><p>with him the remarkable ligature which, had I </p><p>secured it, would have proved of inestimable scien- </p><p>tific value. But my attention was focussed com- </p><p>pletely upon the container which I found was re- </p><p>markably light, about the weight of aluminum, I </p><p>judged. But, despite its apparently fragile char- </p><p>acter I could not succeed in either breaking or dent- </p><p>ing the remarkable material, try as I might. </p><p> My curiosity was now at fever heat, for I knew</p><p>of a certainty that no such material was known to </p><p>civilized man, and that any message or communica- </p><p>tion enclosed within it must be of the utmost im- </p><p>portance and interest. In order to examine it more </p><p>closely I opened my pocket lens and commenced most </p><p>carefully and painstakingly to go over the smooth </p><p>surface of the astonishing receptacle. </p><p> In so doing I advertently brought a point of light</p><p>to a focus upon the cylinder. All that had gone be- </p><p>fore was as nothing to the astounding result of this </p><p>accidental procedure. Instantly the material com- </p><p>menced to melt and run like wax! In a few brief </p><p>moments I had melted a space completely encircling </p><p>the cylinder, and, from the aperture thus made I </p><p>drew forth the roll of manuscript—for such the con- </p><p>tents proved to be, and, spreading the pages com- </p><p>menced to read the incredible story written thereon. </p><p>Certain passages, names and references assured </p><p>me that the story was no fiction nor the work of a </p><p>disordered mind, for many of the incidents men- </p><p>tioned as well as names referred to, were familiar </p><p>582 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>to me. I clearly remembered the departure of the </p><p>bark Endeavor, her failure to return, and the </p><p>various newspaper accounts of her disappearance, </p><p>with the published lists of her personnel. These </p><p>facts, as I have stated, would alone have convinced </p><p>me even had I not felt assured, from the character </p><p>of the receptacle chosen to hold the manuscript, that </p><p>the tale was true, for the material could not have </p><p>been obtained or prepared in any known country or </p><p>by any known race of men. </p><p> Deeply have I regretted, since that time, the fact</p><p>that my engrossment with the manuscript swept </p><p>all thoughts of the cylinder from my mind. I had </p><p>carelessly dropped it as I secured the contents, and </p><p>when, having read and reread the astounding tale </p><p>from beginning to end, I looked for the receptacle, </p><p>it could not be found. My closest and most pains- </p><p>taking search failed to reveal it. Whether it had </p><p>rolled into some crevice or hole in the volcanic rock </p><p>or whether some curious albatross, attracted by the </p><p>glitter of the cylinder, had surreptitiously </p><p>approached and swallowed it, I shall never know. </p><p> ' But even without the cylinder and its attendant</p><p> 'cord as corroborative evidence as to the truth of</p><p> the story I so strangely obtained, the tale itself is</p><p> so manifestly fact, and is of such incalculable value</p><p> to the world that I have not the slightest hesitation</p><p> &gt;in publishing it.</p><p> The manuscript, quite unaltered, is reproduced in</p><p> ithe following pages, and my readers may judge for</p><p> themselves as to the veracity of the author and</p><p> the importance of its revelations which are now</p><p> made public for the first time. The narrative, writ-</p><p> ten legibly in some dark colored medium, upon a</p><p> peculiar parchment-like and exceedingly tough</p><p> (though light material, covered many sheets, and</p><p> \ was as follows:</p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p> By A.

S. A., of the fate of </p><p>that vessel and her men, </p><p>or failing in this, will give</p><p>this writing to some reli- </p><p>able newspaper in order </p><p>that it may be published </p><p>for the benefit and peace </p><p>of mind of all who have </p><p>an interest in the fate of </p><p>the bark which set sail </p><p>from New Bedford on the </p><p>fourteenth day of August, </p><p>1917. </p><p> My name is Franklin</p><p>Bishop and I was born and </p><p>resided at Fairhaven, </p><p>Mass., across the harbor </p><p>from New Bedford. For </p><p>many years I followed </p><p>the sea as a whaleman, </p><p>until in 1917 I shipped </p><p>as first mate on the bark </p><p>Endeavor, Captain Rank- </p><p>lin, bound for the South </p><p>Shetland Islands in search </p><p>of sea-elephant oil, the </p><p>price of oil having greatly </p><p>increased owing to the war. The bark carried a </p><p>crew of sixteen men, six of whom were Portugese </p><p>boat-steerers shipped at Funchal. </p><p> I cannot now recall the names or homes of the</p><p>crew, if indeed I ever knew them, for a large </p><p>number were greenies—human derelicts, and were </p><p>known aboard ship only by their Christian or their </p><p>nicknames. The skipper was George Rankin of </p><p>New London, Ct. The second mate was Jacob </p><p>Marten of Noank, Ct. The cooper was Nicholas </p><p>Chester of Mystic, Ct., and the carpenter was a </p><p>huge, raw boned Scandinavian named Olaf John- </p><p>son. But the names matter little, for I have no </p><p>doubt that even after six years the bark’s owners </p><p>or the New Bedford shipping lists of 1917 can </p><p>supply the names of all </p><p>hands with the exception </p><p>of the Portuguese, and I </p><p>mention the above merely </p><p>to prove the truth of my </p><p>tale and to induce who- </p><p>ever finds it to make </p><p>known the fate of the </p><p>bark and of her crew.”* </p><p>Our voyage, after leav- </p><p>ing Funchal, was pleasant </p><p>and with favorable winds </p><p>and good weather we </p><p>made a quick run until</p><p>south of Tristan da Cunha </p><p>when we ran into heavy </p><p>weather with a north- </p><p>east gale that forced us </p><p>to shorten sail to almost </p><p>bare poles. Even then </p><p>the old bark wallowed </p><p>heavily and made such bad </p><p>weather of the sharp </p><p>irregular seas that we at </p><p>last were forced to heave </p><p>to and even to use oil over </p><p>the bows. This made </p><p>the ship ride easier but our drift was tremendous </p><p>and when, on the fifth day, we managed to take </p><p>sights we found ourselves far off our course and in </p><p>latitude about 45° South and longitude 11° west. </p><p>The exact figures I do not remember. </p><p> We had scarcely made sail and gotten on our</p><p>course when another and even harder gale bore </p><p>down upon us from the northwest, and under bare </p><p>poles we scudded before it for sixty hours, when, </p><p>'See footnote on next page. </p><p> t-TERE is one of the most gripping stories that it has</p><p> , ever been our good fortune to read.

At last, upon the horizon, </p><p>we saw a streak of white, gleaming against the' </p><p>inky murk, and hardly had we grasped rails and </p><p>rigging when the hurricane and blinding sleet and </p><p>snow struck us. Over the old bark went until it </p><p>seemed as if her yards would trip in the mountain- </p><p>ous seas that rushed past her bulwarks. Then </p><p>gradually she righted, and bearing off before the </p><p>wind, tore through the huge seas like a mad thing. </p><p>For ten hours the gale screeched and howled with </p><p>undiminished fury and every effort to bring the </p><p>bark into the wind was useless. Moreover the hail </p><p>and snow was so thick that we could see barely a </p><p>cable’s length from the ship, while rigging and </p><p>spars were loaded with tons of ice and to handle </p><p>ropes was like hauling on steel bars. Then, sud- </p><p>denly from aloft, came the piercing cry “Ice ahead! </p><p>Port your helm! For God’s sake, hard a port!” </p><p> Springing to the wheel I threw all my weight</p><p>upon it, but even with the two men already there, </p><p>we were unable to swing the bark half a point and </p><p>a second later, with a grinding crash, we struck </p><p>the berg. </p><p> So great was the shock that all hands were</p><p>thrown flat upon the deck, and with a splintering </p><p>roar, the fore- and mainmasts went over the side, </p><p>dragging the port bulwarks with them and staving </p><p>a gaping hole in the bark’s side as the jagged butts </p><p>lurched up on the next sea. </p><p> Instantly all was confusion. The Portugese</p><p>rushed to the boats, only to find that all but two </p><p>were staved in, and tried to cut away the falls. </p><p>Luckily the ropes were so sheathed in ice that for</p><p>a moment they could not lower the boats and in </p><p>this brief space of time the captain and myself, </p><p>with the other officers, managed to drive the </p><p>crazed fellows from the boats and to restore some </p><p>sort of order. </p><p>(•Foot note "by Dr. Lyman) </p><p> The following is a clipping from the New Bedford "Mercury1 of</p><p>August 14th, 1917: “Sailed: Bark “Endeavor", Rankin, for pough, </p><p>South Georgia and South Shetland Islands via Funchal. It is with </p><p>pleasure that we note the sailing of the old Whaleship “Endeavor^. </p><p>This is the first of New Bedford’s once great fleet of whalers to set sail </p><p>for the South Atlantic in many years, and we trust that it signifies an </p><p>awakening of the long dormant industry which once made the name of </p><p>New Bedford familiar in every corner of the world. It is a direct out- </p><p>come of the Great War and the consequent advance in the price of oil. </p><p>and while the latter may be and no doubt is only temporary, our still </p><p>serviceable old ships may yet reap golden harvests while high prices </p><p>continue. The “Endeavor's" officers are well known and experienced </p><p>men and we wish them and the owners every success and a ‘greasy </p><p>v'yage’. The “Endeavor’s" officers arc as follows: Captain, George </p><p>Rankin of New London. First mate, Frank Bishop, Fairhaveti. Second, </p><p>Jacob Marten. Noank. Cooper, Nicholas Chester, Mystic. Carpenter, </p><p>and blacksmith, Olaf Johnson, Christiana, Sweden. Cook, Wm. Outer- </p><p>bridge, Hamilton, Bermuda. Boatsteerers, Jake Hildebrand, Nan- </p><p>tucket. Henry Fogarty, Marthas Vineyard. Michael Mendoza, Capo </p><p>Verde Island.”—A. E. L. </p><p> Provisions and water were thrown into the boats,</p><p>but the bark was settling so rapidly that before </p><p>the craft were half provisioned Captain Rankin de- </p><p>cided it would be certain death to wait longer. Ac- </p><p>cordingly the boats were lowered away at once, but </p><p>as I looked at the huge seas and felt the sweep of </p><p>the icy gaie I turned back and chose to risk going </p><p>down with the ship rather than add my weight to </p><p>the overburdened boats that I judged would scarce- </p><p>ly live an hour in the terrific welter of sea and </p><p>wind. </p><p> In this decision I was joined by Olaf, the car-</p><p>penter, and standing upon the rapidly sinking hulk </p><p>we saw the two tiny whaleboats shove off and dis- </p><p>appear in the sleet and snow to leeward. We </p><p>momentarily expected the »;ark to sink beneath us </p><p>and our only hope was that we might have time to </p><p>build some sort of makeshift raft before the vessel </p><p>went down. With this idea we at once commenced </p><p>to gather what materials we could. But long be- </p><p>fore we had secured even a small part of what we </p><p>required the bark had settled until the deck was </p><p>only a few inches above the water. Then suddenly </p><p>she lurched to port, rolled over on her beam ends </p><p>and with a slight shudder remained motionless ex- </p><p>cept for a slight rising and falling on the waves. </p><p>For a moment we were amazed and puzzled and </p><p>could not understand the matter, for I knew hun-</p><p>dreds of fathoms of water lay under our keel. </p><p>Presently, however, we came to grasp the situation, </p><p>Evidently the berg on which we struck projected </p><p>far under water, like a huge shelf, and oQr ship, </p><p>passing over this before she struck, had now settled </p><p>until she rested on the submerged ice shelf. For </p><p>the time we were safe and although the bark rested </p><p>in such a slanting position that we were obliged </p><p>to crawl rather than walk the decks, yet we thanked </p><p>God that we were there, instead of tossing about </p><p>in small boats at the mercy of the tempest. </p><p> As nothing was to be gained by remaining on</p><p>deck we entered the cabin and secured food and </p><p>drink and succeeded in belaying the cabin stove so </p><p>that we could light a fire, which proved most grate- </p><p>ful to our chilled and numbed bodies. Here we </p><p>sat and smoked for uncounted hours, while dimly </p><p>the sound of storm and waves came to us or the </p><p>grating of the bark’s keel upon the ice beneath </p><p>gave us momentary frights. Gradually the storm </p><p>waned and the waves broke less heavily against our </p><p>crippled ship. Towards daybreak We both fell </p><p>asleep and did not awaken until aroused by the </p><p>cold which became terrific as the fire died down. </p><p>We kindled a new fire, and wrapping ourselves in </p><p>heavy coats and oilskins, went on deck. The sun </p><p>was shining brightly close to the horizon, but as </p><p>far as eye could see there was nothing but gleam </p><p>ing ice floes breken by narrow, open lanes of dark </p><p>water and lofty bergs. By watching certain spots </p><p>we soon found that we were drifting rapidly south- </p><p>ward and I went below to secure my sextant and </p><p>take an observation. To my chagrin I found that </p><p>the captain had taken the instruments with him and </p><p>we were without means to learn our position except </p><p>by guess-work. By careful calculation of our drift, </p><p>and assuming that we had been drifting at the </p><p>same speed and in the same direction sincc striking </p><p>the ice, and allowing for our progress since taking </p><p>the last observation. I decided that our latitude and </p><p>584	AMAZING STORIES</p><p>longitude must be about 70° south and 10° east </p><p>The cold was now so intense that we descended to </p><p>the cabin, only occasionally venturing on deck to </p><p>meet with the same weary, drifting, broken ice. </p><p>Our case seemed hopeless indeed, for we well knew </p><p>that we were far beyond the tracks of any ships and </p><p>that unless some miracle occurred we were doomed </p><p>to spend the rest of our days upon the helpless </p><p>wreck, to perish miserably of starvation. With </p><p>such thoughts we turned in at night and for Six </p><p>days our existence was but a repetition of the first. </p><p> On the morning of the seventh day we were</p><p>startled by a roaring, grinding noise and the sudden </p><p>violent lurching of the bark. Rushing on deck and </p><p>fearing the worst, we were thunderstruck to behold </p><p>b-barely a cable’s length away—a rocky, ice-capped </p><p>shore, behind which rose lofty mountains with their </p><p>eummits hidden in clouds. Much to our surprise </p><p>also we found that the weather had greatly moder- </p><p>ated and several big mollymokes were wheeling </p><p>about the ship while seals and sea-leopards basked </p><p>,on the rocks above the surf. Our ice cradle pre- </p><p>vented the bark taking the ground, but in the course </p><p>of a few moments we managed to scramble over the </p><p>intervening broken ice and soon stepped upon the </p><p>shingle. Then, with ropes and hawsers, we suc- </p><p>ceeded in making our wreck fast to the shore. We </p><p>were now reasonably sure that the ship would not </p><p>go adrift, and even if a storm came up and forced </p><p>us to desert our quarters on board, we could no </p><p>doubt salvage enough from the wreck to build some </p><p>manner of craft in which to make our escape from </p><p>this forbidding and uncharted land. </p><p> During the next two or three weeks we busied</p><p>ourselves carrying ashore fuel and provisions and </p><p>in constructing a little hut or shelter in which to </p><p>store the goods or to seek refuge in case of disaster </p><p>to the bark. </p><p> There was no lack of fresh meat, for penguins,</p><p>albatross, mollymokes and Cape pigeons were thick. </p><p>Also, we laid in a fine supply of seal skins and oil </p><p>an preparation for the long and dreary winter which </p><p>we knew we should be forced to face, for we had no </p><p>intentions of trusting ourselves to any frail craft </p><p>we might be able to build until all chances of whale- </p><p>ships reaching us had passed with the summer. </p><p>Although this work kept us busy and left us little </p><p>time to think of our plight, yet often, during meals </p><p>or when done with the day’s work, we talked over </p><p>the probable fates of our comrades and were grate- </p><p>ful at our own salvation, even in such an inhospitable </p><p>land*	®</p><p>•(Foot note by Dr. Lyman)	'</p><p> "Evidently Mr. Bishop did not consider the possibility of any mernlfa</p><p>of the bark’s crew having reached land or safety. The following is a </p><p>clipping from the “New Bedford Mercury” of July 2d, 1919: </p><p> •The schooner Petrel, Archibald, arrived yesterday with 600 bbls. of</p><p>eea-clephant oil; 300 seal skins; 200 bbls. sperm oil; 15 casks spermac- </p><p>eti and 16 lbs. ambergris from the South Atlantic and South Indian </p><p>oceans. Captain Archibald brought with him the survivors of the ill </p><p>fated bark "Endeavor’’ of this poH which sailed for the Antarctic oft </p><p>August 14th, 1917. The "Endeavor” struck a berg and foundered near </p><p>the Bouvets Islands after being driven far off her course by a series of </p><p>gales. The survivors who have both our heartiest sympathies and Our </p><p>most sincere congratulations, are are follows: Jacob Marten, Noank. </p><p>Nicholas Chester, Mystic. Michael Mendoza, Cape Verde Island. </p><p>Henry Fogarty, Marthas Vineyard. Jose Rodriguez, Funchal. Mr. </p><p>Marten, the second mate of the ‘'Endeavor,” states that only two boats </p><p>were lowered, the others having been stove by falling spars. The otheT </p><p>boat contained Captain Rankin and eight men and was lost to sight a </p><p>few moments after leaving the bark’s side. Franklin Jiishop, the first </p><p>mate, and Olaf Johnson, the carpenter, refused to leave the Vessel and </p><p>trust to the boats. After terrible hardships Mr. Marten’s boat reached </p><p>the Bouvets and after three months on those desolate rocks the men </p><p>were picked up by the Petrel. There can be little doubt that those in </p><p>the Captain's boat, as well u Mr. Bishop and the carpenter, per- </p><p>r-hsd-’'’--A. E. L. </p><p>CHAPTER II. </p><p>AS Winter approached, however, Olaf became </p><p>very sullen and morose, often talking to him- </p><p>self and wandering about the rocks, gesticul- </p><p>ating and acting strangely. </p><p> I became afraid that the poor fellow would lose</p><p>his mind completely, and, as on many occasions he </p><p>turned upon me savagely, I was constantly on the </p><p>alert to protect myself. He had been a wonderful </p><p>help, for his skill with tools had enabled us to </p><p>build a comfortable house and without him I would </p><p>have fared badly indeed. </p><p> It was several months after landing that in one</p><p>of his fits of wandering he fell among slippery </p><p>rocks and broke his thigh. I did not find him until </p><p>several hours after the accident, and twixt loss of </p><p>blood and the pain and the piercing cold, he was </p><p>past all human help and quite unconscious. </p><p> I carried him to the hut and did all in my power</p><p>for my suffering shipmate, but it was useless. Early </p><p>the following morning he died, and with heavy </p><p>heart at the loss of my only companion, I carried </p><p>his body to a crevice in the hillside and covered it </p><p>well with stones and gravel, and over it placed </p><p>a small wooden cross on which I carved his name </p><p>and the date of his death. </p><p> I now became most despondent, for I knew that</p><p>alone I could never hope to complete the boat we </p><p>had been working on, and that even if that were </p><p>possible I would be powerless to handle or navigate </p><p>it. I could see nothing but the endless winter and </p><p>utter loneliness before me, with ultimate death </p><p>through accident or madness, unless by some remote </p><p>chance a sail hove in sight. </p><p> In my calmer moments I held to this slender hope</p><p>and tried to conjure up all the tales I had heard of </p><p>castaways living for years alone and yet being </p><p>rescued in the end. I had little fear of meeting with </p><p>an accident as long as I kept my mind, and I real- </p><p>ized that my greatest danger lay in going mad as </p><p>Olaf had done. To avoid this as much as possible </p><p>and to prevent my thoughts from dwelling on my </p><p>plight, I commenced taking long trips across the </p><p>hills in search of game, carrying a supply of am- </p><p>munition and a haversack filled with biscuit or </p><p>dried meat. On one of these tramps I had wandered </p><p>several miles from the hut and had reached the </p><p>summit of a good sized hill, from which I had a </p><p>wide view of the sea. Far down the shore I noticed </p><p>some object about which great flocks of sea fowl </p><p>were gathering, and thinking it a stranded whale or </p><p>sea elephant, I turned my steps towards the spot. </p><p>As I rounded a point of rocks and came within plain </p><p>sight of the object, I almost dropped in my tracks </p><p>from sheer amazement. Upon the beach before me </p><p>was a ship’s boat! </p><p> I broke into a run, and panting, reached the craft</p><p>from which hundreds of mollymokes and other birds </p><p>rose screaming. Gaining the boat’s side I peered </p><p>within and recoiled in horror. Stretched upon the </p><p>thwarts and bottom were the bodies of six men, </p><p>their faces torn and mutilated by the sea birds. But </p><p>even in their ghastly state I knew them for Cap- </p><p>tain Rankin and my former shipmates of the En- </p><p>deavor. I reeled away, for the sight was sickening </p><p>and stunning, and seized with insane and unreas- </p><p>oning fright, I dropped my gun and dashed off </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>585 </p><p>across the rocks and hills, striving with might and </p><p>main to get as far from the gruesome boat as pos- </p><p>sible. </p><p> At last I dropped from sheer exhaustion among</p><p>the rocks, but even then the shock was so great </p><p>that I hid my face and screamed and raved like a </p><p>madman until consciousness left me. </p><p> How long I remained in that condition I cannot</p><p>say, for when at last I awoke to a knowledge of my </p><p>surroundings, I found myself wandering about amid </p><p>thick and thorny scrub on a steep hillside I had </p><p>never seen before. I was ravenously hungry and </p><p>thrust my hand into my haversack in search of </p><p>food, only to find it empty save for a few crumbs </p><p>of ship's bread. Seating myself on a nearby rock I </p><p>munched these eagerly and tried to collect my </p><p>thoughts and reason. I soon came to the conclusion </p><p>that I had been delirious for a long time, and dur- </p><p>ing my period of temporary madness, had wandered </p><p>far, for my haversack had been full when I first </p><p>sighted the boat and was now empty, and I reasoned </p><p>that I must have devoured my food during my un- </p><p>conscious wanderings. My watch had stopped, but </p><p>this mattered little, as for months I had been able </p><p>merely to guess at the time. A search of my pock- </p><p>ets failed to reveal my compass but I felt this was </p><p>no great loss at the time, for I had no doubt that, </p><p>by climbing a neighboring hill, I could make out </p><p>the sea and so find my way back to the hut, al- </p><p>though I confess that the mere thought of again </p><p>approaching the ghastly remains of my shipmates </p><p>filled me with most awful dread and caused me to </p><p>shudder violently. </p><p> My tongue and throat were parched and dry and</p><p>the hard crumbs of biscuit added to my thirst, so I </p><p>at once commenced to push my way up the hillside </p><p>through the shrubbery. As I reached the top and </p><p>looked about, no gleaming bit of sea greeted my </p><p>eyes. On every side stretched rolling, round-topped </p><p>hills, each and all clothed in dull, brownish-gray </p><p>scrub, save just behind me, where the more distant </p><p>landscape was hidden from view by a higher range </p><p>of small mountains. Although my thirst was now </p><p>unbearable yet I knew that my one hope of finding </p><p>my way was to ascend the higher hill, and with </p><p>sinking heart and lagging footsteps, I started for </p><p>them. Slowly and painfully I climbed their rough </p><p>and rocky slopes, stopping often to rest and regain </p><p>my failing breath, but at last I stood upon their </p><p>crest and gazed anxiously about the horizon. For </p><p>a moment my head swam and a mist floated before </p><p>my eyes. Then my vision cleared and I saw before</p><p>me a long, sloping hillside covered with scattered </p><p>shrubs, while below and stretching far towards the </p><p>horizon, was a green and pleasant valley on whose </p><p>farther edge rose high and rugged mountains misty </p><p>■with distance. But though no water gladdened my </p><p>eyes, yet near at hand I saw a number of great birds </p><p>resembling penguins, and towards these I rapidly </p><p>made my way. They were stupid and fearless and </p><p>in a moment I had killed the first one I reached and </p><p>greedily drank its rick warm blood. This refreshed </p><p>me greatly, but feeling still hungry, I gathered a </p><p>quantity of eggs, which I ate raw, and feeling </p><p>drowsy made my way to a sheltered nook among the </p><p>rocks and fell into a deep and dreamless sleep. </p><p> I awoke feeling strong but half famished, and at</p><p>once fell to on the helpless birds and their eggs. I </p><p>now considered my next step and as there evidently </p><p>was nothing to be gained by retracing my way I </p><p>decided to travel towards the valley where I judged </p><p>perhaps water might be found, for although the </p><p>blood and raw eggs had somewhat quenched my </p><p>thirst, yet the desire for water was overpowering. </p><p>As I did not know if I would find more birds farther </p><p>on, I laid in a good supply of flesh and eggs, and as </p><p>I noticed that my shoes were almost worn out, I </p><p>wrapped birds’ skins about my feet, binding them </p><p>in place with strips of the skin. </p><p> I now noticed that these birds were not penguins,</p><p>as I had at first thought, nor in fact anything like </p><p>any birds I had even before seen. I judged there- </p><p>fore that I was far from the coast, but I was wholly </p><p>without means of ascertaining the dix-ection of the </p><p>sea or my position, for I had seen nothing of the </p><p>sun since finding the boat, although the days were </p><p>bright enough. As I thought on this its strange- </p><p>ness came to me and I also marveled that I was not </p><p>suffering from the cold. The more I thought of </p><p>these matters the more I wondered, for now that I </p><p>came to think of it, the weather was quite warm </p><p>and I had seen no snow or ice, even among the crev- </p><p>ices of the rocks. But I had other things to occupy </p><p>my attention, for my thirst for water and my desire </p><p>to escape from my surroundings filled my head to </p><p>the exclusion of all less pressing matters, as for </p><p>hour after hour I tramped on across the valley. </p><p>From the hilltop it had appeared clothed in soft </p><p>grass, but when I reached it I found to my sorrow </p><p>that the vegetation was thorny, pointed-leaf shrubs </p><p>whose tangled branches formed an almost impene- </p><p>trable jungle which made my progress painful and </p><p>slow beyond belief. I soon lost all sense of time or </p><p>direction, but toiled on towards the distant mount- </p><p>tains, eating the birds’ flesh and eggs when hungry </p><p>and at last sinking down to sleep when my tired </p><p>and torn flesh refused to carry me farther on my</p><p>way. Only by looking at the hills behind me could </p><p>I see that I had made any progress towards the </p><p>mountains, which seemed as distant as ever. But </p><p>gradually the hills grew dim in the distance, while </p><p>ahead, the mountains became more distinct and </p><p>great seams and patches of vegetation appeared up- </p><p>on their slopes. It was well for me that I had laid in </p><p>a supply of meat and eggs, for I saw no sign of life </p><p>on the dreary plain, except one great beast that ap- </p><p>peared like a gigantic lizard or iguana. In fact, so </p><p>monstrous was the creature, that I feared my brain </p><p>had gone adrift again and that it was but a vision </p><p>of delirium. The beast appeared more afraid of </p><p>me than I of him, however, and so little interest </p><p>did I have in anything save the desire for water and </p><p>to reach the farther side of the valley that I doubt </p><p>if I would have turned aside or would have fled even </p><p>though the devil himself had confronted me. Cer- </p><p>tain it is that the presence of this huge creature— </p><p>I would say he was forty feet in length—did not </p><p>prevent me from dropping off to sleep as usual that </p><p>night. </p><p> At last my provisions became perilously low and</p><p>when finally I reached the bases of the mountains I </p><p>was reduced to two eggs, while my makeshift boots </p><p>were gone entirely and my garments were merely </p><p>a few dirty rags and shreds. To climb those rugged </p><p>mountains seemed utterly beyond my power, but I </p><p>noticed a sort of cut or ravine a half mile or so dis- </p><p>586 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>tant, and thinking this might be a pass through the </p><p>mountains, I dragged myself toward it. It was a </p><p>deep fissure and extended far up the mountain side </p><p>and while it made the climb a bit easier I soon </p><p>found that the task was far greater than I had ex- </p><p>pected, and only by the utmost efforts could I force </p><p>my way upward. But some unknown force or in- </p><p>stinct seemed to drag me on, and even when my last </p><p>egg had been devoured I did not despair, but strug- </p><p>gled and found my way, foot by foot, over the rocks </p><p>and boulders and through patches of low scrub, un- </p><p>til almost fainting from hunger and thirst, I came </p><p>to another colony of the strange birds. On these I </p><p>feasted until satisfied, and while resting and tying </p><p>more of the bird-skins on my bruised and swollen </p><p>feet, I found time to give some thought to my sur- </p><p>roundings. </p><p> I had often heard of the theory of a vast Antarc-</p><p>tic continent, and although I of course knew that </p><p>Shackleton had found the South Pole, still I was </p><p>now convinced that I had passed the pole and was </p><p>on this unknown land. </p><p> But the fact that the weather was warm puzzled</p><p>me immensely, while quite beyond my understand- </p><p>ing was the fact that I had seen no glimpse of the </p><p>sun on my long tramp across the plain. No theory, </p><p>however wild and impossible, would account ~Yor </p><p>this, for it was not dark but as bright as any Ant- </p><p>arctic day, and neither could I understand how, es- </p><p>pecially without the sun, I could feel comfortably </p><p>warm. At last, giving up the puzzle in despair, I </p><p>gathered up my load of birds and eggs and once </p><p>more started on. </p><p> And here it may be well to explain why I was</p><p>able to think upon such matters, which are usually </p><p>beyond, the mind of a sailor, and how, as will be </p><p>seen later, I happened to have a knowledge of many </p><p>matters, such as science, mechanics and similar </p><p>things of which the sailor or whaleman, as a rule, </p><p>knows nothing. For several years I had been an of- </p><p>ficer on one of the ships of the United States Fish </p><p>Commission, and from the scientists engaged in </p><p>deep sea research I had learned a great deal about </p><p>natural history which interested me always, and </p><p>learning for the first time that specimens of animal </p><p>life, minerals and plants had a cash value, I secured </p><p>a commission from one of the museums to collect </p><p>specimens on my whaling voyages to distant parts </p><p>of the world. This led me to study works on science, </p><p>and through long Arctic nights, I filled my brain </p><p>with all manner of knowledge relating to geology,/ </p><p>zoology, botany and other similar matters.</p><p> Also, I had always been fond of mechanics, and</p><p>as the whaling industry waned ahd the demand for </p><p>sailors decreased in the merchant service, I bent my </p><p>energies to acquiring a knowledge of machinery </p><p>so that I might secure a berth on some steam or </p><p>motor-propelled craft. In doing this I became ab- </p><p>sorbed in the matter and found vast interest in </p><p>reading all manner of books and magazines treating </p><p>of the latest inventions and discoveries in the me- </p><p>chanical world. Of course I had little practical </p><p>knowledge of these things, but the theories were </p><p>fixed in my mind, and as it proved later, were of </p><p>great value to me. </p><p> But to resume my narrative. Long and weary</p><p>as my tramp across the plain had been, tenfold </p><p>worse was the never ending upward climb towards </p><p>the cloud-piercing summits of the mountains. My </p><p>days were measured only by my waking moments, </p><p>for the light never ceased, and my labor was only </p><p>marked by long periods of panting, heartbreaking </p><p>toil and periods of deep sleep, and while, to keep </p><p>some sort of track of the hours, I had started my </p><p>watch, yet this gave me no real time, but merely </p><p>served to let my Enow how long I slept and how long </p><p>I toiled upwards. Five days of this labor had again </p><p>worn my makeshift footgear to pieces and had re- </p><p>duced my provisions to my last egg, when I reached </p><p>the summit of the mountains, and falling exhausted </p><p>upon the bare and wind-swept rocks, looked down </p><p>upon the farther side. </p><p> At my first glance my heart gave a great throb</p><p>of joy and I thanked heaven that I had been led on </p><p>to the summit. Spreading from the base of the </p><p>mountains was a wide level plain covered with rich </p><p>and verdant green, while far away, gleaming like </p><p>silver in the bright light, stretched a vast expanse; </p><p>of water. </p><p> Forgetting my sore, torn feet and my utter ex-</p><p>haustion, I rose and dashed forward down the slope. </p><p>Stumbling over boulders, tripped by vines and </p><p>shrubs, falling, sliding and scrambling, I reached </p><p>the bottom in a few hours and dashed into the lux- </p><p>uriant grass that rose higher than my head. Here </p><p>my strength failed me, and falling upon the earth, </p><p>I felt utterly unable to rise again. </p><p> Presently I heard a slight rustling sound in the</p><p>grass near me, and glancing up, beheld a strange </p><p>animal staring at me in wonder, but evidently with- </p><p>out the least fear. Thinking only to secure some- </p><p>thing to eat I managed to stagger to my feet and </p><p>started towards the animal. I had no weapon ex- </p><p>cept my knife, but the beast stood his ground until</p><p>I was within a few feet when, by a sudden spring, </p><p>I reached his side, and driving my knife into his( </p><p>throat, brought him down. In my famished state </p><p>his blood and raw, warm meat were as welcome as </p><p>the daintiest food, and having satisfied myself, I </p><p>fell asleep beside his partially devoured carcass. </p><p> Several hours later I awoke, feeling much strong-</p><p>er, and looked more closely at the beast whose fort- </p><p>unate appearance had saved my life. I found hinS </p><p>to be a sort of huge rat or mouse—although I had </p><p>at first mistaken him for a small deer—and my </p><p>stomach turned a bit at the thought that I had </p><p>actually eaten his flesh. I now became conscious of </p><p>a peculiar quality in the air that I had not noticed </p><p>before. At first I was puzzled to account for it, </p><p>but gradually I realized that the light had become </p><p>intensely blue instead of white or yellow. It was </p><p>like looking through a blue-tinted glass, and for the </p><p>first time I noticed that my hands and knife and </p><p>even the face of my watch, appeared bluish and </p><p>strange. My longing for water, however, was too </p><p>great to allow me to give mueh thought to the matter </p><p>and turning from the dead animal—for hungry a3 </p><p>I was I could not force myself to eat more of him—i </p><p>started on in the direction of the water I had seen </p><p>from the mountain top. The grass grew close and </p><p>was very dry and gave off a dusty, choking material </p><p>or pollen which filled my eyes, nose and mouth and </p><p>each moment increased my thirst and dried and </p><p>blistered my aching, parched throat; But gradually </p><p>the grass became thinner and now and then I caught </p><p>glimpses of small creatures ahd birds that fled be- </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>587 </p><p>fore me, while the ground under my feet became </p><p>less dry and parched, until presently, the damp, </p><p>sweet smell of water reached me. A moment later </p><p>I burst through the last of the grass and saw be- </p><p>fore me a sandy beach lapped by tiny waves whose </p><p>sound was the most welcome thing I had ever heard. </p><p>Rushing across the beach, I threw myself face </p><p>down at the water’s edge with a sickening fear </p><p>that the water might be salt. But my first taste </p><p>reassured me, and burying my face and hands in </p><p>the waves, I drank until I felt sick and nauseated, </p><p>when, crawling up the beach on all fours, I drew </p><p>myself into the shelter of the grass and lost con- </p><p>sciousness. </p><p>CHAPTER 3. </p><p>SLOWLY I opened my eyes and as I did so I </p><p>screamed aloud with terror and wonder. </p><p>Standing over me was a fearsome, terrible </p><p>creature. That he was not a man I knew at my first </p><p>glance, and yet, there was something that resembled </p><p>a man about him, but so terribly monstrous, weird </p><p>and incredible, so utterly inhuman, that I felt sure </p><p>I must be dreaming or out of my senses. He or it </p><p>was fully eight feet in height, standing on two legs </p><p>like a man, and seemingly clad from head to foot in </p><p>some soft, downy material that glistened with a </p><p>thousand colors, like the throat of a humming bird </p><p>or the tints on a soap bubble. Above the shoulders </p><p>was a large, elongated, pointed head with a wide </p><p>mouth and a long, pointed snout. From the fore- </p><p>head projected long stalks or horns and on the tip </p><p>of each of these was an unwinking, gleaming eye </p><p>like the eyes of a crab. In place of eyebrows two </p><p>long, slender, jointed, fleshy tentacles drooped down </p><p>over the creature’s shoulders, while the ears were </p><p>long, soft and pendulous like those of a hound. </p><p>There was no hair upon the head, but instead, a </p><p>number of brilliant, shining scales or plates, lap- </p><p>ping one over the other from the forehead to the </p><p>nape of the neck. </p><p> No wonder I was horrified and startled at this</p><p>apparition and as I gazed upon the thing and saw </p><p>that it possessed three pairs of long, many-jointed </p><p>arms, I shrieked again at the monstrosity of it. At </p><p>my cry and my terrified actions, the creature raised </p><p>one hand in a reassuring gesture and I was further </p><p>horrified to see that in place of fingers the arm end- </p><p>ed in a mass of delicate various-shaped appendages </p><p>of several sizes, that reminded me of the soft legs </p><p>on the belly of a crawfish or shrimp. I shrank away </p><p>as far as possible, but the being seemed to smile, </p><p>his stalked eyes drew back into his head and he ut-</p><p>tered some strange sounds in a low, soft tone which </p><p>I judge were words of greeting or reassurance, al- </p><p>though to my ears they meant nothing. </p><p> Finding I did not respond—for I was still too</p><p>dazed and frightened to utter a sound—the thing </p><p>stooped and extended a small object towards me. It </p><p>resembled a ship’s biscuit in form and size and as </p><p>I hesitated to take it the creature pointed to his </p><p>own mouth and nodded, evidently meaning I was </p><p>to eat it. I had no difficulty in grasping this mean- </p><p>ing and famished as I was, rather hesitatingly </p><p>took the object and greedily devoured it. In taste </p><p>it was slightly sweet with a rather pleasant arom- </p><p>atic flavor and I at once signed my desire for more. </p><p>My weird friend, for I now knew that despite his </p><p>fearful appearance the creature was well disposed' </p><p>towards me, handed me two more of the biscuits </p><p>and as he did so I had a chance to look more closely </p><p>at his hands. They were truly remarkable. Each </p><p>of the dozen or more finger-like digits was of a dis- </p><p>tinct form and size. Some were large, strong and </p><p>blunt; others slender and pointed; others with pin- </p><p>cer-like tips, while still others were divided at the </p><p>extremities into several filaments almost as fine as </p><p>hairs. Marvelous and repulsive as they seemed, yet </p><p>I could not help realizing even then what wonder- </p><p>ful work such hands might accomplish if they were </p><p>controlled by intelligence and muscles as perfect as </p><p>man’s, and yet my wildest ideas of such things fell </p><p>far short of the reality. </p><p> Seating himself, or I might say, sprawling him-</p><p>self, beside me, the thing watched me munch the </p><p>biscuit and I in turn gazed at him with the utmost </p><p>curiosity, as I had now partially overcome my dread. </p><p>I now saw that what I had mistaken for clothing </p><p>was in reality a growth upon the skin, a material </p><p>something like wool and yet something like feathers. </p><p>The feet, too, I found were as strange as the rest </p><p>of the body or the hands, for in place of toes, they </p><p>bore round-tipped digits covered with saucer-shaped </p><p>suckers like those upon the tentacles of an octopus </p><p>or squid. </p><p> Undoubted I was as great a marvel to him as he</p><p>was to me, for I could see that his surprise at my </p><p>appearance was tremendous. His long flexible feel- </p><p>ers rose and fell about me—though not touching </p><p>me for which I was thankful—his eyes turned and </p><p>moved up and down as he looked me over from head </p><p>to foot, and presently, realizing I no longer feared </p><p>him, he extended one hand and very gently passed </p><p>it over my clothing. I shuddered at the first touch, </p><p>but as one of the appendages or fingers touched my </p><p>flesh and I found it soft and warm and not cold or </p><p>clammy as I had expected, my revulsion became</p><p>less. Still the sensation of being handled or touched </p><p>by the horribly formed thing was creepy and I had </p><p>to use all my will to avoid drawing back. Evident- </p><p>ly he was greatly surprised at the result of his </p><p>examination and gazed at me more intently than </p><p>ever, meanwhile uttering low, strange words or </p><p>sounds that reminded me of the purring of a cat </p><p>with a little of the rasping, metallic sound of a </p><p>cricket. </p><p> Presently, seeing I had eaten the last of the</p><p>biscuits, the creature rose to his two hind feet, </p><p>folded two other pairs of limbs under his body, and </p><p>beckoning with the fourth pair, or as I might call </p><p>them, his arms, made me understand that I was to </p><p>follow him. Filled with curiosity to know what </p><p>wonders lay before me, and feeling sure the crea- </p><p>ture was friendly and peaceable, I also rose and to </p><p>my amazement found that all my health and </p><p>strength had returned in a most miraculous man- </p><p>ner. I was as refreshed, light hearted and free </p><p>from aches, soreness or pain as ever in my life and </p><p>as I walked with springy, buoyant steps after the </p><p>weird being my mind was filled with wonder. </p><p>Surely, I thought, the three small biscuits could </p><p>not have stayed my ravenous appetite and given </p><p>me such strength, and yet there was no other way </p><p>to account for it. But whatever the reason, my </p><p>troubles were over for the present. I had water in </p><p>plenty before me, the creature leading the way </p><p>588 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>across the beach could provide food, and whatever </p><p>the future might hold or wherever I might be, I </p><p>would not die of thirst or starvation, while the in- </p><p>credible giant was friendly and apparently wished </p><p>to help me. </p><p> I had no doubt that he was leading me to some</p><p>house or settlement, and I was filled with curiosity </p><p>to see what manner of creatures dwelt in this </p><p>strange land. That they would be most interesting I </p><p>felt sure, for I knew that, hitherto, the Antarctic </p><p>had been thought uninhabited by man, and I wond- </p><p>ered if they would resemble Eskimos, Indians or </p><p>South Sea Islanders. That they should have dom- </p><p>esticated such strangely weird creatures as the </p><p>being who was guiding me, proved not only that </p><p>they were intelligent, but that I might expect other </p><p>and perhaps even greater surprises, while the fact </p><p>that this monstrosity was so kindly and well dis- </p><p>posed assured me that his masters would treat me </p><p>with consideration. It was all very dream-like, and </p><p>had it not been for my ragged garments, my thorn- </p><p>torn and bruised flesh and my sore feet I should </p><p>have felt sure that it was all a figment of my over- </p><p>wrought brain, for it was almost too incredible to </p><p>be true. I had set out from the desolate, forbidding </p><p>shores of the Antarctic within a few degrees of the </p><p>South Pole, and here I was in a land as mild and </p><p>pleasant as New England in June; the sea—or what </p><p>I took to be the sea—was fresh pure water; the bril- </p><p>liant sunshine, which should not have existed at all </p><p>in this spot, was pale blue instead of white; and </p><p>before me strode a creature such as no mortal man </p><p>had ever seen save in some nightmare or the deliri- </p><p>um of fever or drink; while to me, at the time, the </p><p>most incredible thing of all was the fact that after </p><p>eating three small, dry biscuits I had regained all </p><p>my strength and felt as fresh—with the exception </p><p>of my blistered feet—as ever in my life.	__</p><p> We had walked along the beach for some time,</p><p>and I was beginning to wonder how much farther </p><p>we must travel, when we rounded a bend and I saw </p><p>a peculiar object resting on the sand a few yards </p><p>ahead of us. It was about fifty feet in length, about </p><p>ten feet in diameter, cylindrical and with pointed </p><p>ends, resembling in a way a gigantic cigar. In the </p><p>bluish light it shone with the brilliant lustre of </p><p>metal, but with a peculiar purplish sheen that was </p><p>unlike any metal I had ever seen. As we approached </p><p>this object, I halted in my tracks with gaping </p><p>mouth and staring, incredulous eyes. A door had </p><p>opened in the affair, and from the aperture, two </p><p>more of the weirdly horrible looking creatures had </p><p>appeared. In every detail they were exactly like my</p><p>guide, except that one was mueh smaller and was </p><p>covered with a pale, pinkish coat of down or feath- </p><p>ers, or whatever the material might be called. In- </p><p>stantly, I was aware of a peculiar, vibrating, hum- </p><p>ming sound and noticed that my companion’s feelers </p><p>or antennae had risen erect above his head and were </p><p>moving slowly, gracefully back and forth, as were </p><p>the feelers of the two other creatures; but no word </p><p>or sound that could be thought speech issued from </p><p>any of the three. </p><p> A moment later we were beside the great, cylin-</p><p>drical object and the two beings who had been with- </p><p>in it were gazing at me with the greatest wonder </p><p>and interest. Their stalked eyes were moving this </p><p>Way and that, studying me from head to foot; their </p><p>feelers were vibrating with excitement; their lop- </p><p>ears were waving like the ears of an elephant, and </p><p>presently, with queer, low sounds from their lips, </p><p>they stretched out their jointed limbs and rather </p><p>hesitatingly and cautiously touched my garments </p><p>with their many digited hands or feet, whichever </p><p>they might be called. </p><p> I was, I admit, most uneasy and not a little</p><p>frightened and had a peculiar sense of repulsion as </p><p>the creatures approached close to me and their </p><p>tentacles played about my face and their soft finger- </p><p>like extremities caressed my tattered clothing. </p><p>But I knew that for the present at least I had no </p><p>real cause for alarm, for they seemed really gentle </p><p>creatures. But if my readers—provided this </p><p>manuscript ever finds a reader—can imagine stand- </p><p>ing beside three immense crayfish larger than any </p><p>giant of a dime museum, they can perhaps, in a </p><p>measure, realize the sensations that went over me. </p><p> Even so I found myself wondering if the huge</p><p>cylinder before me was the dwelling of these weird </p><p>things, if it was a sort of shell-like house, and if </p><p>the three were the only denizens of this unknown </p><p>land, or if there were more of their kind. But I </p><p>instantly dismissed the thought. They were merely </p><p>strangely developed, remarkably intelligent beasts </p><p>and it was inconceivable that they should have con- </p><p>structed the metallic affair from which they had </p><p>emerged. In fact, the presence of this convinced </p><p>me that there were human beings not far distant </p><p>and that the creatures beside me were merely </p><p>guarding the metallic object and awaiting their </p><p>master’s return. Moreover, the fact that this huge, </p><p>metal, cigar-like thing was there proved beyond </p><p>doubt that the men who dwelt in the land were no </p><p>primitive savages, but intelligent and civilized, al- </p><p>though what the purpose of the thing was was </p><p>quite beyond me. Possibly, I thought, it was some </p><p>sort of boat—for it looked much like one of the</p><p>floats to a metal life raft—perhaps a submarine; </p><p>but there were no signs of rudders, fins, propellers </p><p>or other external fittings on its smooth surface, and </p><p>aside from the door or port from which the two </p><p>creatures had emerged, no opening or aperture in </p><p>the metal as far as I could see. </p><p> But, I had little time for thought on such mat-</p><p>ters. Their first curiosity satisfied, my guide ges- </p><p>tured for me to follow, and entered the big cylinder </p><p>with the other two following in my footsteps. </p><p>Scarcely knowing what to expect, I passed through </p><p>the door and glanced about. I was in a long room </p><p>or hallway illuminated by a strange luminous glow </p><p>and an exclamation of the utmost amazement </p><p>escaped my lips as I discovered that the walls of </p><p>the cylinder were as transparent as glass. Stand- </p><p>ing there, I could see the beach, the stretch of </p><p>water, the green fringe of grass and bushes, as </p><p>clearly as though I were in the open air and yet </p><p>from without, the interior of the contrivance had </p><p>been utterly invisible. </p><p> This was astounding enough, but before I could</p><p>fully appreciate the wonder of it, there were more </p><p>bewildering matters to fill my brain. The interior </p><p>held no machinery, the only fittings in sight being </p><p>couch-like benches, rugs or carpets and an affair at </p><p>one end which at first glance I took to be a buffet or </p><p>bar, for it bore a number of shining metallic and </p><p>glass-like utensils. Above and behind it was a </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>'589 </p><p>panel or rectangle covered with strange dials and </p><p>instruments, and as we entered and the door closed </p><p>behind us with a slight metallic clink, the creature </p><p>who had first found me approached this buffet-like </p><p>arrangement. Reaching out his arms, he moved </p><p>certain things upon the panel, with his other limbs </p><p>he touched the utensils on the piece of furniture </p><p>before him. Instantly, there was a strange musical </p><p>humming which rose swiftly to a whirring sound, </p><p>like the muffled noise of machinery and glancing </p><p>through the transparent sides of the cylinder, I </p><p>was dumbfounded to see the beach and the water </p><p>swiftly dropping from beneath us. For a moment </p><p>I could not understand and then, with a shock at </p><p>the discovery, I realized that we were mounting up- </p><p>ward with incredible speed. Within the space of a </p><p>few seconds we were several hundred feet above the </p><p>beach and the next instant my bewildered senses </p><p>grasped the fact that we were hurtling through the </p><p>air like a bullet from a rifle. </p><p> Almost before I knew it the beach and the grassy</p><p>plain beyond it were dim in the distance, the faintly </p><p>outlined waves upon the water seemed to rush back- </p><p>ward and yet there was not the least movement ap- </p><p>preciable within the transparent cylinder, and al- </p><p>though I could see the entire interior from where I </p><p>stood, there was no sign of machinery, no hint of </p><p>engines, of whirring wheels or shafts. It was ab- </p><p>solutely impossible and incredible. Within a cigar- </p><p>shaped cylinder, which even if made of aluminum </p><p>would have weighed tons, I was being hurled </p><p>through space by invisible means controlled by the </p><p>indescribably strange creatures beside me. </p><p> I peered ahead, for I knew that we must be bound</p><p>for some definite goal, and saw land rising rapidly </p><p>into view upon the horizon. Each second it became </p><p>clearer, a low shore backed by hills deliciously green </p><p>and bathed in the blue light that flooded everything. </p><p>And as the land grew rapidly more distinct, bright, </p><p>shining dots appeared among the greenery and pre- </p><p>sently, above the water’s edge, an immense town or </p><p>city lay spread. At the speed at which we were </p><p>traveling we would be there within fifteen minutes, </p><p>and as I glanced to right and left, I saw a score of </p><p>craft similar to the one I was in, all rushing through </p><p>the air like monstrous, gleaming cannon shells. </p><p>Like streaks of light they crossed our path above or </p><p>below us; to right and left they passed. Some were </p><p>tiny things scarcely ten feet in length; others </p><p>gigantic affairs several hundred feet in length, but </p><p>all moving noiselessly, with incredible speed, driven </p><p>by some unseen, incomprehensible, terrific power. </p><p>Below us, now, the water was dotted with the</p><p>strange vessels, their shimmering hulls, if such I </p><p>may call them, resting on the surface or skittering </p><p>along slowly and leaving foamy wakes across the </p><p>little waves. Then we were dropping, descending </p><p>as lightly as a bit of thistle down, and almost </p><p>under my feet I saw the outlying buildings of the </p><p>town. So rapidly did we drop that at the time I </p><p>had no chance to note the form or details of the </p><p>buildings, except to see that they were of strange </p><p>design and color, but even in our swift fall, in that </p><p>space of a few seconds, I saw that the inhabitants, </p><p>the beings who thronged the .streets, were no hu- </p><p>mans, but one and all the same grotesque, mon- </p><p>strous creatures as those beside me. </p><p>CHAPTER 4, </p><p>SHOCKED as I was at this discovery I saw that: </p><p>our arrival had been noticed, and that froirj </p><p>every side, hurrying down the streets, swarm- </p><p>ing out of buildings, the creatures were rushing </p><p>in a close packed mass towards a clear, open space </p><p>like a broad level field which I judged was our </p><p>landing place. The next moment our strange air- </p><p>ship was at rest, and filled with unreasoning dread, </p><p>trembling at thought of facing; that horde of mon- </p><p>sters, I followed my guides or captors, which ever </p><p>they were, through the door and stepped upon tho </p><p>firm earth once more. All about the borders of </p><p>the field, which I now saw was covered with cradle* </p><p>like structures like the one in which our craft </p><p>rested, the stalk-eyed, misshapen beings had gath- </p><p>ered, a maze of swaying, undulating antennae, of </p><p>tall, pointed, scale-covered heads and irridescent </p><p>bodies; but not one attempted to approach or to </p><p>pass within the boundaries of the landing place. </p><p> Hardly had I noticed this, and wondered at it,</p><p>when from one side a group of the monsters stepped </p><p>out. At first glance they seemed no different from </p><p>the others, but as they drew close I saw that they </p><p>were of a totally different color, being a peculiar </p><p>violet-blue, and that two pairs of their limbs or </p><p>arms ended in enormous, vicious-looking claws or </p><p>nippers like those of a lobster. Even as I noticed </p><p>this they reached us and I shuddered as I thought </p><p>of how easily the creatures could crush and tear </p><p>me to bits with those fearful pincers with their </p><p>serrated teeth. </p><p> But for the present the claws were at rest and</p><p>closed and their owners made no hostile movement. </p><p>Forming on either side of my guides and myself, </p><p>they marched beside us, and before them the crowd </p><p>fell back, leaving an open lane through which we </p><p>passed. </p><p> Before us were buildings, and for the first time,</p><p>I obtained a clear view of the structures and gaped, </p><p>almost as astonished at their appearance as I had </p><p>been at the monstrous forms of their owners. From </p><p>high in air they had seemed low, massive structures </p><p>with nothing particularly remarkable about them, </p><p>but now, close at hand I saw that they were unlike </p><p>anything I had ever seen, although in a vague way </p><p>they reminded me of gigantic igloos. Windowless </p><p>they rose like domes of dull-gray above the earth, </p><p>the only apertures in their walls, dark, yawning’ </p><p>arched doorways towards one of which my guards </p><p>were marching. As we entered the portal my pass- </p><p>ing glance showed me that the affairs were not of </p><p>mud or clay as I had thought at first, but were </p><p>constructed of small stones and pebbles cemented </p><p>together with some hard tenacious material giving </p><p>them the effect of being hewn from coarse pudding </p><p>stone, or as I believe geologists call it, conglomerate </p><p>rock. </p><p> The next instant we were within the entrance and</p><p>were descending a steep incline. So sharp was thei </p><p>slope that the skin coverings on my feet slipped, </p><p>my feet shot out from under me and with a startled </p><p>cry I went sliding and rolling through the semi- </p><p>darkness like a bale of cargo down a chute. How </p><p>far I might have gone or where I might have </p><p>brought up I cannot say, for with incredible agility* </p><p>two of the monsters overtook me and with theiij </p><p>590 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>•weird limbs—which made me shudder as they </p><p>touched me—brought me to a halt and helped me to </p><p>my feet. </p><p> Despite the confusion and my predicament I had</p><p>noticed that the creatures, when in a hurry, ran </p><p>along on all fours, or rather I might say on all </p><p>eights, and I realized that the sucker-like disks on </p><p>their feet enabled them to navigate the steep pas- </p><p>sage without the least danger of slipping. </p><p> No doubt my mishap seemed very amusing to</p><p>the strange beings, but no sounds of merriment </p><p>came from them and to this moment I have never </p><p>heard anything that remotely resembled a laugh </p><p>or chuckle issue from the mouths of the creatures. </p><p> The whole affair, yes, everything that had occur-</p><p>red since I had seen the castaway boat with the </p><p>corpses of my dead shipmates, was so dreamlike, so </p><p>nightmarish that, try as I might, I could not con- </p><p>vince myself that I was awake and that the strange </p><p>events were actually taking place and that the be- </p><p>ings,—intelligent, reasoning, possessing powers </p><p>and mechanical devices beyond anything dreamed </p><p>of by man, and yet mere beasts or creatures of a </p><p>lower order—really existed and were not the crea- </p><p>tions of a disordered or wandering mind. But my </p><p>fall was very real and as the creatures aided me to </p><p>rise and I ruefully rubbed my bruised and barked </p><p>limbs I knew that the tumble at least was no delir- </p><p>ium. Indeed, I think that my mishap was the most </p><p>convincing thing that had occurred. It is really </p><p>strange how little, unimportant, every day matters </p><p>are often of so much greater importance in our lives </p><p>than great events, and all that I had undergone had </p><p>failed to impress me as much, or to bring so vividly </p><p>to my mind, the marvelous situation in which I </p><p>found myself as that tumble on the steep incline </p><p>leading through the darkness to the interior of </p><p>some subterranean chamber. </p><p> At the time, however, I had little opportunity to</p><p>give much thought to such matters. Before me a </p><p>dull light shone, and a moment later, we emerged </p><p>from the passage and entered a huge, round cham- </p><p>ber. Although, at my first sight of the place, I </p><p>did not take in the details, it may be as well to </p><p>describe it at this point of my narrative. The floor </p><p>was smooth, white and seemed made of some lumin- </p><p>ous material; the walls glowed with dull light, and </p><p>the high, domed ceiling appeared as if of glass with </p><p>brilliant bluish light streaming through it. </p><p> About the walls was a low bench or shelf-like ar-</p><p>rangement covered with what appeared to be cush- </p><p>ions; scattered about were curiously shaped chairs </p><p>or stools, and in the centre, was a sort of raised </p><p>dais or platform on which were several more seats </p><p>and a desk-like arrangement covered with dials and </p><p>instruments, much like the affair I had already </p><p>seem in the airship and by means of which the </p><p>creatures handled the craft. Upon the bench about </p><p>the walls, and seated on the other stools, were </p><p>several dozen of the beings to whom I was now be- </p><p>coming accustomed. In a general way they were </p><p>precisely like my guards and the creature I had </p><p>first met upon the distant beach, but in details </p><p>they were different. In fact, no two were exactly </p><p>alike, although it was not until long afterward that </p><p>I learned to distinguish the various differences, </p><p>some of which were very minute. They were of </p><p>all colors, from white to nearly black, although all </p><p>had the same peculiar metallic sheen I had already </p><p>noted, and all likewise possessed eight limbs, the </p><p>long-stalked eyes and the antennae. Already I </p><p>had been impressed with the striking resemblance </p><p>the creatures bore to giant crawfish, but now, as </p><p>I gazed about the huge chamber, I had the feel- </p><p>ing that I was surrounded by huge crustaceans </p><p>possessed of intelligent, reasoning brains. Pos- </p><p>sibly I cannot convey to my readers—if by the </p><p>will of God this narrative ever reaches human </p><p>beings—-the weirdly impossible, dreamlike and </p><p>in a way, horrible sensations that swept over </p><p>me as I stared at the scaly heads, the slowly </p><p>moving stalked eyes, the waving, undulating </p><p>antennae and the eight jointed limbs of these be- </p><p>ings and realized that here in this strange land </p><p>beyond the South Pole evolution had proceeded in </p><p>a very amazing and very different manner to that </p><p>which had taken place in the world of men. Years </p><p>before I had read, among my other books, a work </p><p>by Darwin on evolution and the survival of the </p><p>fittest. Although I had never fully accepted the </p><p>idea that mankind had descended or ascended from </p><p>some monkey-like ancestor, still I could understand </p><p>how it might be possible, and I had been convinced </p><p>that man, as well as other members of the animal </p><p>kingdom, had developed from other more primitive </p><p>forms. And now, as I stood within the illuminated </p><p>chamber, it suddenly dawned upon my mind that </p><p>the creatures among whom my lot had been cast </p><p>actually proved Darwin’s theory. Here before me </p><p>and all about me were beings no whit less intelligent </p><p>than human beings; creatures who had conquered </p><p>space and time with incredible aircraft; beings who </p><p>could converse without words and who, I later found, </p><p>were far in advance of man, and yet who bore not </p><p>the remotest resemblance to humans. To put the </p><p>matter in a few words; just as men resemble highly </p><p>developed and advanced apes, so these beings re-</p><p>sembled crustaceans. If the human race had been </p><p>evolved from some ape-like creature, then beyond </p><p>the shadow of a doubt, these creatures had been </p><p>evolved from some lobster-like ancestor. The dis- </p><p>covery came to me as a shock. So accustomed are </p><p>we to think that intelligent, reasoning, civilized </p><p>beings must be moulded in human form that it </p><p>rather dazed me to find that the mere form of </p><p>body and limbs had nothing to do with it; that the </p><p>mere chance that man’s ancestors had been apes or </p><p>ape-like had led to the physical appearance of hu- </p><p>man beings, and that, had some other form of life </p><p>been the fittest to survive and had gone through </p><p>ages of evolution, our world might have been peo- </p><p>pled by insects, reptiles or any other creatures as </p><p>progressive, intelligent and highly civilized as </p><p>ourselves. </p><p> Here before me was the proof of this. Here</p><p>evolution had proceeded from cold-blooded, spineless </p><p>crustaceans, and the result was these shrimp-like </p><p>giants, possessing powers beyond my own or those </p><p>of mankind. Of course, at the time, the full signi- </p><p>ficance of the matter did not come to me, but as </p><p>time passed and I learned how immeasurably be- </p><p>yond man these creatures had advanced I became </p><p>more and more convinced that the accident of the </p><p>origin of the human race had been an unfortunate </p><p>rather than a fortunate thing for the world and </p><p>that, had we been evolved from ants, say, we would </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>591 </p><p>have been much farther along the road to highest </p><p>attainments. </p><p> But I am digressing. At the time I was really</p><p>more impressed by the curious discoveries I made </p><p>than by thoughts on evolution. One of the first </p><p>things I noticed, and which oddly enough had quite </p><p>escaped me hitherto, was the fact that the creatures </p><p>possessed tails. These were broad, flat affairs com- </p><p>posed of overlapping plates or scales and which </p><p>usually remained folded like fans. This no doubt </p><p>was the reason they had escaped my notice, for </p><p>being of the same color and texture as the rest </p><p>of the bodies, I had taken them for ornamental </p><p>pendant affairs, portions of the garments which I </p><p>had thought the things wore, for I had not yet dis- </p><p>covered that the feather-like covering of their bodies </p><p>was a natural growth. </p><p> Now, however, I saw that when seated the tails</p><p>stuck stiffly out behind the creatures, or in some </p><p>cases were cui’led around to one side, and that they </p><p>moved to and fro, opening and shutting in a most </p><p>fascinating manner. Some I noted also, were far </p><p>larger than others, and, later, I learned to disting- </p><p>uish the males and females by the form and size </p><p>of their tails. </p><p> Of course all this which has taken so much time</p><p>to write down occupied but a few instants and my </p><p>eyes, having swept about the chamber, turned to </p><p>the dais in the center and the creatures who were </p><p>seated upon it. </p><p> These were taller, more slender and more brilliant</p><p>in color than the others. Their heads were higher, </p><p>broader and rounder; their antennse were longer </p><p>and their eyes, borne on long stalks like the others; </p><p>seemed to me to have a more intelligent expression, </p><p>if indeed, such hard, cold, unwinking orbs were </p><p>capable of expression of any sort. </p><p> By intuition I knew that they were leaders or</p><p>rulers and that I was being brought before them, </p><p>and somehow this almost human proceedure of be- </p><p>ing led by armed guards before a tribunal sur- </p><p>rounded by a curious crowd struck me as both </p><p>ludicrous and amazing. </p><p> That I was in danger never occurred to me.</p><p>Possibly it was because I had been through so much </p><p>that I was callous of danger, or perhaps it was be- </p><p>cause man instinctively looks down upon inferior </p><p>races or creatures; but whatever the reason, al- </p><p>though I was fully aware that I was at their mercy,</p><p>I felt no fear but rather was filled with interest and </p><p>curiosity as to what would occur. Indeed, I felt </p><p>precisely as I have felt when, in dreams, I have </p><p>been dragged before a court to be tried for my life </p><p>on some ridiculous charge, and knowing I might be </p><p>condemned to death, yet I felt no dread of the re- </p><p>sults, owing to a peculiar subconscious conviction </p><p>that I would escape harm and would awaken before </p><p>the actual execution took place. </p><p> Also, I was filled with a curiosity as to how the</p><p>hearing was to be conducted, for while there was no </p><p>doubt that the creatures could converse readily </p><p>among themselves, their words, or whatever means </p><p>they used, were inaudible to me, and when they </p><p>uttered sounds, as they did at times, the almost </p><p>metallic noises were uttely unintelligible. </p><p> But I had far underestimated the uncanny, in-</p><p>credible powers of the creatures. Suddenly I was </p><p>aware, as one beoomes aware of some unseen person </p><p>gazing at one in a crowd, that I was being question- </p><p>ed. I cannot describe the sensation, cannot make </p><p>it clear. There was no sound, nothing to tell me </p><p>that my ears were receiving any message, and as a </p><p>matter of fact they were not. </p><p> And yet my brains, or some unknown sense, was</p><p>receiving a message, questions which, could they </p><p>be put into word, might have been been expressed </p><p>as “Who are you ? Whence do you come? What is </p><p>your purpose?” </p><p> Was I dreaming, losing my senses, going mad</p><p>from my past hardships and my amazing adven- </p><p>tures? And then, almost unconsciouly, I found my- </p><p>self replying to the inaudible queries. I was trying </p><p>to explain how I had been shipwrecked, how I had </p><p>wandered across the mountains and had come to </p><p>this land, and that my only purpose was, if pos- </p><p>sible, to return to ray own countiy. </p><p> And as I thus responded to the uncanny question</p><p>entering my brain without audible sounds, I knew </p><p>from the actions of the strange beings that my </p><p>replies had been understood. Their antennse waved </p><p>and trembled excitedly. They turned their stalked </p><p>eyes and gazed at one another and at myself, and </p><p>they even uttered the queer metallic sounds which </p><p>always denoted great excitement. </p><p> It had been astounding enough to discover that</p><p>the creatures could make themselves understood </p><p>by some occult, uncanny power; but to find that I </p><p>could make my thoughts clear to them was almost </p><p>beyond reason. How had it been accomplished? </p><p>How was it possible for me, a totally different be-</p><p>ing from another world, to understand these strange </p><p>creatures? And what was still more astonishing, </p><p>more inexplicable yet, how had I been able to trans- </p><p>fer my thoughts to their brains? Was it some </p><p>weird, undreamed-of method of mental telepathy, </p><p>hypnotism or what? Even if they possessed some </p><p>power, some unknown means of making me under- </p><p>stand them, I certainly had no such power. And </p><p>yet I was convinced that I had made myself clear </p><p>to them, or at my rate had managed to reply in </p><p>some fashion to their queries. </p><p> And the next instant my belief was confirmed.</p><p>Once more, in my brain, questions were being </p><p>registered, questions as intelligible as though I had </p><p>heard the words spoken in English. I was being </p><p>asked about “my world,” questioned as to details </p><p>of ray journey, as to whether there were more be- </p><p>ings like myself and various other matters. </p><p> Almost before I realized it, I was replying and,</p><p>as I could see by the manner of my strange hosts, </p><p>my words were heard and understood. It is of no </p><p>use to describe at length the entire interview that </p><p>followed or to repeat it word for word. It is enough </p><p>for my purpose to state that my story was as un- </p><p>believable and as impossible to them as they and </p><p>their powers seemed to me. I had appeared from </p><p>nowhere, a strange, and to them misshapen being, </p><p>a creature unlike anything they had ever imagined, </p><p>and I found myself trying to explain, floundering </p><p>about, trying to make clear matters which to me </p><p>were most everyday and ordinary things, but to </p><p>them were so far beyond their comprehension that </p><p>they were utterly incapable of grasping them. </p><p> It was like trying to explain trigonometry or</p><p>navigation to a small child or to make clear the </p><p>principles and operation of some complicated ma- </p><p>592	AMAZING STORIES</p><p>chine to a savage. And yet this comparison is not </p><p>the right one, for strange as it may seem, the </p><p>creatures were quite capable of understanding the </p><p>most intricate mechanical devices and scientific </p><p>matters, although the fact that there were other </p><p>intelligent beings- in the world, or that for that </p><p>matter there was any world except their own coun- </p><p>try, was utterly beyond them. </p><p> Of course I did not learn this and did not at-</p><p>tempt to converse with them on such matters at </p><p>this first interview. Our talk, for regardless of </p><p>the fact that they did not speak I must call it a </p><p>talk, was confined to the most simple matters. </p><p>But as the weeks, months and years passed </p><p>and I remained, as I still remain, among them, I </p><p>tried to tell them of human life and the world 1 had </p><p>known and of all manner of things which differed </p><p>from their own strange ways and existence. </p><p> Gradually, too, I became adept at conversing with</p><p>them by their uncanny means, which, I found </p><p>later, was nothing supernatural, magical nor so </p><p>very mysterious after all. It was accomplished in </p><p>fact by vibrating waves sent through the air, some- </p><p>thing after the manner in which sound waves are </p><p>sent, and which were produced by one pair of the </p><p>creatures’ antenme and were caught and heard by </p><p>another pair.* </p><p>CHAPTER 5. </p><p>IT was soon evident to me that even if the </p><p>weird creatures could not fully grasp or under- </p><p>stand the tale I related, still they believed it, </p><p>or at least considered that it explained my presence </p><p>in their land. Possibly they thought me a harm- </p><p>less lunatic, or again they may have decided I was </p><p>a supernatural being, or maybe I was such a curi- </p><p>osity or monstrosity in their eyes that I was re- </p><p>garded as a valuable specimen. At any rate, what- </p><p>ever the reason, they decided that I was not to be </p><p>harmed, and in fact was to be well treated, for my </p><p>armed guards were dispersed and I was given to </p><p>understand,—I would say told but for the fact that </p><p>no words were spoken—that the being who had </p><p>first found me on the sand was to be my companion </p><p>and that he would attend to all my wants. My </p><p>first and most pressing want was food, for I was </p><p>once more ravenously hungry and the council oi’ </p><p>court and onlookers having left the chamber, though </p><p>(Nate by Dr. Lynian) </p><p> “Mr. Bishop had of course never heard of radio-tejcphony. I am of</p><p>the opinion that the beings among whom he found himself had discover- </p><p>ed and perfected some form of radio waves_ by means of which inielli</p><p>gihle messages could be transmitted from mind to mind without audible </p><p>sounds. Ip other words, the unspoken thoughts could be transmitted on </p><p>high frequency waves or on some form of waves akin to electro-map* </p><p>netic waves. As is well known today, scientists have reason to believe </p><p>that the lower animals possess a somewhat simflar power and can re- </p><p>ceive and understand certain waves of which we have no knpwledge— </p><p>perhaps the missing ‘waves that in length lie between heat waves and </p><p>radio waves. It is also believed by many scientists that it is by some </p><p>such means that pigeons, dogs, cats and even toads find their way home </p><p>across unknown spaces and for immense distances, and that migratory </p><p>birds fly unerringly from place to place. Recent investigations have </p><p>also led to the conclusion that insects and crustaceans converse or at </p><p>least communicate with one another, by means of waves produced by </p><p>and received by tbeir antennae. If this be so, then the highly developed </p><p>and specialized crustaceans who inhabit the strange land described by </p><p>Mr. Bishop might well have possessed a similar power earned to the »th </p><p> C/bsuming this were s», then there would have been no mystery as to</p><p>J-ow they understood him or he them, for while spoken words vary </p><p>with language the thoughts or brain impressions that words express </p><p>must be identical regardless of spoken dialects or racial differences. </p><p>Indeed, as will be seen later, Mr. Bishop’s discoveries, as he relates </p><p>them, bear out this logical conclusion. It is also highly probable that </p><p>all the mechanism of the airships and other contrivances of these </p><p>strange beings were actuated by waves similar to our elcctro-magnetic </p><p>waves.”—A. E. L. </p><p>lingering and gazing at me most curiously, I ex- </p><p>pressed my wishes to my strange companion. Im- </p><p>mediately he led me through dark passageways </p><p>to a smaller room and there left me for a moment, </p><p>returning with a bowl-like vessel containing some </p><p>liquid and a beautifully devised casket or box filled </p><p>with the biscuits such as he had given me upon the </p><p>beach. </p><p> I devoured three of these and was about to eat</p><p>the fourth when the creature, who had been watch- </p><p>ing me intently, called a halt and by the same </p><p>strange brain message method warned me that I </p><p>must be satisfied and that to partake of more might </p><p>lead to grave results. I confess I was greatly </p><p>tempted to disregard his warning, for there seemed </p><p>no more sustenance in the stuff than in a dry </p><p>cracker, but I remembered what a miraculous effect </p><p>those I had eaten on the beach had had, and re- </p><p>luctantly replacing the wafer I drank a deep draught </p><p>of the liquid. It was as clear and colorless as water, </p><p>for which I had taken it, but as it passed my lips </p><p>I almost dropped the bowl in surprise, for the </p><p>beverage was the most delightful and refreshing </p><p>thing I had ever tasted. It was neither sweet nor </p><p>sour, but had a taste absolutely impossible to des- </p><p>cribe. Indeed, there are many things in this strange </p><p>land which I am at a loss to describe in such a way </p><p>that those who have not seen or experienced them </p><p>can understand my meaning. Colors existed which </p><p>were quite different from anything I had ever</p><p>seen; there were sounds totally new to my ears and </p><p>tastes that no words can describe. </p><p> Scarcely had the beverage passed my lips when I</p><p>felt rejuvenated. No wine or liquor could have </p><p>had such a remarkable effect. Not that it was </p><p>heady or exhilarating like liquor, for my head re- </p><p>mained perfectly clear, but I felt years younger. I </p><p>seemed as strong and fresh as a youth of twenty </p><p>and felt ready for anything. Then a delightful </p><p>drowsiness came over me, and throwing myself </p><p>on the couch, I instantly dropped off to a dreamless </p><p>slumber. </p><p> I was aroused by the being who had me in charge</p><p>as he entered the chamber bearing food and drink. </p><p>As I munched the wafer-like biscuits, which were </p><p>of a different character from those I had eaten the </p><p>previous day, I tried my best to communicate with </p><p>him. Or rather, I might say, to carry on a con- </p><p>versation, for he very evidently understood all that </p><p>I said. Moreover, as on the preceding day, I was </p><p>able to understand him. But the difficulty was that </p><p>we had so little in common that it was almost im- </p><p>possible to converse at any length. However, he </p><p>made it known that I was free to go and come as I </p><p>pleased and that I was considered an honored guest </p><p>from some other sphere, and I was vastly amused </p><p>when he wished to know if I had dropped from the </p><p>sky. Evidently the creatures knew nothing of a </p><p>country beyond the mountain barrier, and in vain </p><p>I endeavored to explain how I had come over the </p><p>mountains and to tell of the world on the other side. </p><p>To him such a thing was incredible, as unbelievable </p><p>as his land would have been to me before I had seen </p><p>it. Then, after much trouble, he told me—if I </p><p>can use the word "told” when no sounds issued </p><p>from him,—that no inhabitant of his country had </p><p>ever passed those mountains, that beyond was </p><p>nothingness and that his country comprised the </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>593 </p><p>entire world. This was most astounding to me, for </p><p>I had come over the mountains without excessive </p><p>difficulty, and with their marvelous airships I could </p><p>see no reason why they should not have soared above </p><p>the peaks. But when I questioned the fellow, and </p><p>later talked with others, I learned to my amazement </p><p>that the creatures perished miserably if they rose </p><p>more than a few hundred feet above the earth. </p><p>Their airships never attained a height of more than </p><p>two hundred feet and I was informed that too- </p><p>venturesome members of the community, who had </p><p>attempted to traverse the mountains, had gasped </p><p>and died long before they reached the summits. </p><p>To them, strange as it may seem, an altitude of </p><p>five hundred feet was as fatal as a dozen miles in </p><p>air to human beings. Whether this was due to their </p><p>physical peculiarities or to some peculiarity in their </p><p>atmosphere I have never determined. I am of the </p><p>opinion, however, that it is a little of both. Their </p><p>air I am sure is far more rarefied than ours and </p><p>thus of course would be unfit to sustain life even </p><p>at moderate heights, while being evolved from cru- </p><p>staceans—as I am positive they are—and with </p><p>modified gills instead of lungs, they are naturally </p><p>less adaptable to changes in the density of air than </p><p>are human beings. Indeed, later, when I on one </p><p>occasion tried to scale the mountains, I discovered </p><p>that it was with the utmost difficulty that I could </p><p>breathe, even when half way to the summits. </p><p> But this was not the reason why I was forced</p><p>to remain in this land even to the present time as </p><p>I shall explain later. </p><p> But to resume my narrative of my experiences.</p><p>As soon as I had finished my breakfast I started out </p><p>to see the sights. It was, however, some time before </p><p>I reached the outer air, for I found many most </p><p>astounding and interesting things to attract me in </p><p>the underground residences of these strange crea- </p><p>tures. </p><p> The means of lighting the place was a puzzle, for</p><p>as I have said, the illumination was a sort of glow </p><p>that appeared to issue from the walls, floors and </p><p>ceilings, as if in fact they were made of translucent </p><p>material with lights behind them. I examined the </p><p>material carefully and found it was formed of one </p><p>continuous unbroken surface, as if moulded or cast </p><p>in place, as I found later it was. Also, I discovered </p><p>that it was the same material of which the airships </p><p>were made. Indeed, later on I found that it was </p><p>the sole material these beings possessed for con- </p><p>structing anything—that is, aside from wood which </p><p>was seldom used and was rather a curiosity than</p><p>otherwise, and a tough grass which they considered </p><p>of little value, but from which a thin, light and ex- </p><p>cellent parchment-like material is made,—the ma- </p><p>terial in fact upon which this manuscript is written. </p><p>But the amazing part of it is that the metallic-like </p><p>substance so widely used can be so altered or modi- </p><p>fied that it is adaptable for every purpose. </p><p> It can be made opaque, transparent ©r trans-</p><p>lucent; as hard as steel or as soft and plastic as </p><p>putty; as brittle as glass or as flexible as rubber. </p><p>It can be beaten or hammered like gold or copper; </p><p>it can be moulded by hand or machine and then </p><p>hardened, or it can be melted and cast. Moreover, </p><p>it can be colored or tinted at will; it can be woven </p><p>like thread and it can be cut, bored or worked like </p><p>timber. By certain processes, too, it can be made* </p><p>to emit light indefinitely, while the light may yet </p><p>be turned off or on at will by means of some electri- </p><p>cal or similar power. This same mysterious force </p><p>serves these creatures in place of steam, heat and </p><p>all other forms of power. </p><p> It was of course a long time before I learned all</p><p>this, and I was still longer in learning the source </p><p>of the remarkable substance. Then, to my utter </p><p>amazement I found it was sulphur! This statement </p><p>may seem incredible, for sulphur is so well known </p><p>and its properties so well understood that my fel- </p><p>low men will no doubt accuse me of telling a palp- </p><p>able falsehood. But the secret lies in the fact that </p><p>these beings have discovered a property of sulphur </p><p>of which humans are wholly ignorant. This is that </p><p>sulphur is really a metal, the form knowm to us be- </p><p>ing only a salt or oxide, and it is the metallic sul- </p><p>phur which these weird creatures use for such a </p><p>multitude of purposes.* </p><p> It was, as I have said, a great surprise to me to</p><p>discover this, and I could not help thinking what </p><p>marvelous accomplishments might be ours if we </p><p>possessed the knowledge of obtaining this metal. I </p><p>had never dreamed that a metallic material could </p><p>be obtained from sulphur, and at first it seemed un- </p><p>believable. But as I thought upon the matter, I </p><p>realized that, after all, it was no more astonishing </p><p>than that aluminum metal could be secured from </p><p>the soft rock called bauxite, many cargoes of which </p><p>had been carried in ships on which I had served. </p><p>Later, too, J spent much time at the vast deposits of </p><p>sulphur which seem to underlie the whole country. </p><p>Although it has been used for countless ages, yet </p><p>these beings have never had to do any mining, for </p><p>there are hills and plains composed entirely of the </p><p>yellow stuff. Indeed, I was not long in deciding </p><p>that the whole place is nothing more than the in- </p><p>terior of a huge volcano, or a series of volcanic</p><p>craters, which might partly account for the warmth </p><p>of the climate, for no doubt there is still volcanic </p><p>activity and heat below the surface of the earth. </p><p>The processes_ used for refining the sulphur and </p><p>transforming it into metal were most interesting, </p><p>but I am no chemist and the technicalities are far </p><p>beyond my powers to describe. There are huge </p><p>works that cover many square miles, and the </p><p>workers are, I found, all of different types, forms </p><p>and appearances from the other inhabitants. In </p><p>fact each art, profession, trade, and class, of the </p><p>beings is, I soon found, distinct and has been </p><p>evolved or developed in such a way as to give the </p><p>greatest efficiency and best results along the lines </p><p>of endeavor to which each is bound for life. I have </p><p>mentioned the huge pincer-like claws of the sol- </p><p>diers, or rather police. In the same way diggers </p><p>have limbs adapted to their lahors; chemists possess </p><p>appendages as delicate as the most acurately de- </p><p>vised instruments, and so on. </p><p> But to return to the sulphur and its uses.</p><p>Among other things that interested me greatly </p><p>(Note by Dr. Lyman). </p><p> Wuunaware. that sacral chemists have de-</p><p>clared their belief that the element sulphur is derived from a metallic </p><p>base. Although no one has yet produced metallic sulphur, yet that docs </p><p>not prove the incorrectness of such an hypothesis. Soda, potash anr </p><p>many other common chemicals, which bear no resemblance to metals </p><p>are merely salts or oxides of metals, although their metallic bases </p><p>were t«rnieriy unknown. Modern chemistry, however, has, as is weli </p><p>known, produced metallic sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, </p><p>etc. —A. E: *- </p><p>594 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>was the source of the marvelous power the crea- </p><p>tures use. This was, I found, derived from a pe- </p><p>culiar blackish and very heavy material which </p><p>exists in vast quantities near the sulphur deposits. </p><p>Of itself it is of little value, although it is slightly </p><p>luminous and will cause sores like burns upon hu- </p><p>man skin as I discovered to my sorrow. But when </p><p>combined with the metallic sulphur, or with cer- </p><p>tain by-products obtained in the manufacture of </p><p>the latter, it produces most astonishing results. By </p><p>varying the combinations and the proportions of </p><p>materials it can be made to emit blinding light </p><p>which goes on continuously forever without in the </p><p>least diminishing, or it can be made to explode with </p><p>a force greater than dynamite, while by still other </p><p>methods it may be made to produce invisible power </p><p>which can be harnessed as readily as steam and yet </p><p>can be transmitted to great distances through the </p><p>air, like electricity, but without the use of wires. </p><p>About one hundred miles from the chief city is an </p><p>immense power house, if such it may be called, and </p><p>from this, power o* energy is sent broadcast over </p><p>the whole country. Thus, by having machines adapt- </p><p>ed to the purpose, this source of power may be </p><p>tapped and used for any purpose, such as driving </p><p>airships, industrial work, turning on or off lights </p><p>etc. But the remarkable part of it, to me, is the </p><p>fact that no machines, as we know such things, are </p><p>used. I have visited the plant several times and </p><p>yet have never found a single wheel, shaft or crank </p><p>in it. There are merely immense chambers or vats </p><p>into which the various substance are run, and grid- </p><p>like mazes of bars and sheets of metal. These are </p><p>suspended over the vats and a ceaseless play of </p><p>many-colored and strangely tinted lights and in- </p><p>tense heat seems to rush upward from the tanks </p><p>and to be absorbed by the odd apparatus overhead, </p><p>irom these it is led into a labyrinth of receptacles </p><p>and a mystifying, to me, network of conduits, cables </p><p>and huge wires and up-standing rods. These scin- </p><p>tillate with flashing lights and emit a cracking sound </p><p>and send the power in all directions. The strang- </p><p>est thing about it, to my mind, is the fact that the </p><p>creatures are not injured by this power, even when </p><p>close to it and while it is passing through their </p><p>bodies. At first I was deathly afraid of it, for it </p><p>seemed like terrific discharges of electricity; but I </p><p>found that even I could stand beside the generators, </p><p>or whatever they may be called, and that with the </p><p>colorod flashes all about me and enveloping my body, </p><p>I felt no ill effects. Rather, it gave me a pleasant </p><p>tingling sensation which left me exhilarated for </p><p>several days thereafter.* </p><p> Also, aside from the metal and the power, many</p><p>other most valuable things are obtained from the </p><p>sulphur and the black rock. A vast number of by- </p><p>products result, and from these all or nearly all </p><p>(Note by Dr. Lyman). </p><p> "Probably the material described by Mr. Bishop is a very rich radio-</p><p> active mineral nkin to or identical with prtclj-blcmie, and by combin-</p><p> ing this with derivatives of sulphur the marvelous powers of radium</p><p> were harnessed. Just how the strange power was produced we can-</p><p> not say, for Mr. Bishop was of course ignorant of technicalities, as ho</p><p> states. I should imagine, however, that the power was generated by</p><p> breaking down atoms by means of radio activity and thus releasing</p><p> the stupendous forces contained in them. This h3s long been a dream</p><p> ol scientists, for it is well known that a single atom of matter contains</p><p> incalculable power or energy and that, if it were possible to break</p><p> or explode atoms undreamed of force* would be at nun’s disposal.</p><p> Unquestionably the power described by Mr. Bishop was transmitted by</p><p> means of elcctro-magnetic or similar waves.'*—-A. £. tfe</p><p>the wants of the inhabitants are obtained. Even </p><p>the strange beverage I have mentioned was manu- </p><p>factured from a by-product, as are coloring mater- </p><p>ials, certain foods and many other things. Also, </p><p>as I have said, wood is regarded as a curiosity. </p><p>This is due to the fact that strangely enough there </p><p>are practically no real trees in this strange land. </p><p>By this I do not mean that trees do not exist, for </p><p>there are great parks or gardens filled with them, </p><p>but there are no wild trees, if I may use the ex- </p><p>pression. Ages ago, I understand, there were many, </p><p>but these were all utilized and exhausted and fear- </p><p>ing that trees would become extinct they were </p><p>preserved in parks as curiosities. </p><p> Only when they die is the wood available and the</p><p>creatures prize this highly and treasure it as though </p><p>it were a most precious substance, using it as we </p><p>might use gold or silver. Most of the country is </p><p>covered with a coarse, sedgy grass, but there are </p><p>many forms of shrubs and plants and immense </p><p>areas of bare land which at first puzzled me. </p><p> I had seen no cultivated plants or gardens—ex-</p><p>cept park-like places like botanical gardens—and I </p><p>imagined that the bare areas were fields being pre- </p><p>pared for cultivation, as I saw many of the beings </p><p>working in them. Imagine my wonder when I </p><p>found that these bare patches of earth provided the </p><p>inhabitants with their food. Countless years ago, </p><p>I was informed, the beings had abandoned raising </p><p>food plants. The plants, so they discovered, merely </p><p>drew sustenance from the air and soil and trans- </p><p>formed this to food fit to eat. And the creatures, </p><p>reasoning that this process of nature was a round- </p><p>about method of making food, devised means of </p><p>obtaining their provisions from the air and earth </p><p>direct, doing away with the plants entirely.</p><p> From the edible materials thus obtained they</p><p>make the wafer-like biscuit I have referred to and </p><p>these, with their liquors and little pellets, form </p><p>their entire diet. Each class or variety of wafer, </p><p>I learned, contained different food values of a vege- </p><p>table nature, while the pellets supplies the animal </p><p>mattei*, and by choosing these any taste or need </p><p>could be satisfied. Also, just as they secure pro- </p><p>visions of a vegetable nature from the soil itself </p><p>without the time and trouble involved in raising </p><p>crops, so they manufacture the foods of an animal </p><p>nature from the vegetable products. Animals, they </p><p>say, merely transform the herbage they devour in </p><p>to meat, and such things, so why raise living crea- </p><p>tures with great trouble and care and then slaughter </p><p>them, when the same materials, or at least material </p><p>containing the same nourishment and the same </p><p>chemicals, can be made direct? </p><p> And a word in regard to the animal life of this</p><p>strange country may be of interest to any humans </p><p>who find this document. At certain seasons, vast </p><p>numbers of birds visit the great lakes or seas, which </p><p>are all of fresh watex’, and I have found a great deal </p><p>of pleasure in watching these, for the albatrosses, </p><p>mollymokes, gulls and other familiar birds come over </p><p>the mountains from the world I once knew, and </p><p>seem to me a bit like visitors and old friends from </p><p>my home. It was, in fact, these periodical visits </p><p>of the sea fowl that gave me the idea of sending out </p><p>my manuscript, in the hope that some man might </p><p>find it. But to return to the animals that dwell </p><p>here. There are a number of the giant rat-lik§ </p><p>BEYOND THE POLE </p><p>595 </p><p>creatures, as large as kids, such as the one I killed </p><p>and devoured when I first gained the base of the </p><p>mountains, and there are many small birds, but </p><p>aside from these, no living creatures exist in a wild </p><p>state. In zoos or museums are many most wonder- </p><p>ful creatures, some of which bear a resemblance to </p><p>those on the other side of the world, but most of </p><p>which are wholly different and many of which are </p><p>so astoundingly weird, gigantic or grotesque as to </p><p>be horrifying, or to make me think I am dreaming </p><p>or delirious when I look at them. </p><p> Some of these are gigantic reptiles with immense</p><p>scaly bodies and with heads covered with great bony </p><p>plates and armed with huge horns. They are </p><p>ferocious looking creatures nearly fifty feet in </p><p>length, but quite docile and harmless and very </p><p>stupid. Others resemble giant seals, but instead of </p><p>being covered with fur, their bodies are smooth and </p><p>slimy, like eels. There are also creatures with </p><p>enormously long snake-like necks and great round </p><p>bodies. These are water animals and should they </p><p>be seen at sea they would be veritable sea-serpents. </p><p>There are several great beasts too, which appear </p><p>to be some sort of elephants, though vastly bigger </p><p>than any I have ever seen, and there are a few </p><p>rhinoceros-like animals, besides numbers of smaller </p><p>things, such as deer, goats, beasts somewhat like </p><p>ponies, and giant turtles. Of carnivorous beasts </p><p>there are none and I find nothing that at all re- </p><p>sembles an ox or sheep. All these I understand once </p><p>roamed the country wild, but were destroyed by the </p><p>strange inhabitants until only those in captivity </p><p>remained. But perhaps the weirdest of all these </p><p>creatures in the parks or zoos are the insects. There </p><p>are butterflies whose wings spread a yard across, </p><p>flies as big as turkeys, caterpillars with a girth </p><p>greater than my body and immense spiders with </p><p>six-foot, hairy legs and immense, staring, fiery red </p><p>eyes. These always give me a feeling of dread and </p><p>nausea as I look at them, and many a time I have </p><p>awakened, screaming, from a nightmare wherein I </p><p>thought myself being attacked by one of these hor- </p><p>rible creatures. The natives, however, seem to have </p><p>no fear of them and I have often seen the younger </p><p>ones, or if I may so call them the children, feeding </p><p>the monstrous spiders through the bars of their </p><p>cages. These bars by the way are made of the trans- </p><p>parent form of the sulphur metal, and looking at the </p><p>creatures, the bars are all but invisible—as are the </p><p>cages—so that one seems to see a horrible beast un- </p><p>confined and ready to spring at one. But of all the in- </p><p>sects, those which interest me most are the giant- </p><p>ants. These are as large as good-sized dogs and are</p><p>kept in a vast pit-like enclosure. Here they hurry </p><p>about, and labor ceaselessly, building huge mounds </p><p>and digging tunnels, only to tear them down and </p><p>start over again. They are the most ferocious of </p><p>all the animals also, and if one of their number </p><p>is injured or sick, the others, after carefully ex- </p><p>amining him, tear him to bits and devour his still </p><p>moving body. On one occasion a great lizard-like </p><p>beast died and his carcass was thrown into the ant </p><p>pit and I fairly shook with terror as I watched the </p><p>creatures, gnawing him to bits and with incredible </p><p>strength dragging the immense body here and there. </p><p>Often, too, the ants seem to be drilling and they </p><p>seem to possess intelligences almost human. Often </p><p>I think what terrible havoc they would play should </p><p>they escape from their den, but I am assured that </p><p>this is impossible, as the frail looking fence that </p><p>borders the pit is made of a material that is certain </p><p>death to any ant that touches it. Indeed, I heard, if </p><p>I may use that term, the story of these ants. It </p><p>seems that ages ago,—these beings have no means of </p><p>recording time by the way,—the ants roamed at </p><p>large and destroyed the inabitants everywhere. A </p><p>constant war was waged between the two races and </p><p>bloody battles were fought. In a way it was much </p><p>like the Indian warfare at home, though far more </p><p>merciless and cruel, for each side made slaves of </p><p>their captives and gave no quarter. </p><p> Then the crustacean-like beings made a discovery.</p><p>They found vast numbers of dead ants where an </p><p>invading army had moved across a great pile of </p><p>waste material from the sulphur works, and by test- </p><p>ing this on captive ants they found that it was </p><p>instant death to the creatures. This enabled them </p><p>to exterminate their hereditary enemies, for the </p><p>material was made in stupendous quantities and </p><p>placed in a great wall or pile about the advancing </p><p>host of the inhabitants. Thus guarded, the ants </p><p>were powerless to harm them, and gradually all but </p><p>a few of the ants were utterly destroyed. These </p><p>few survivors were made prisoners and confined </p><p>and it is the descendants of these that are in the pit </p><p>today. </p><p> Since then, so I understand, there have been no</p><p>wars or battles in the entire land and the soldiers </p><p>or police are being done away with, as there is </p><p>really no need for them. No more soldiers are bred </p><p>and in a few years none of the old ones will remain </p><p>alive. </p><p> {To be concluded in the November issue)</p><p>Into the Fourth Dimension </p><p> By RAY CUMMINGS</p><p> Author of the "Girl of the Golden Atom”, and "Around the Universe’’.</p><p>99 </p><p>THIS new story by Ray Cummings will not only </p><p>entertain you but will mystify you as well.

First we darted high in the air, and then </p><p>set off at a great rate. It now became evident at </p><p>what a vast distance from the capital, and from the </p><p>inhabited lands of Venu^, we had landed in our </p><p>wild descent from the cloud-dome. </p><p> But for Ala’s topographical knowledge, we shoulc</p><p> have been long in finding the proper route.</p><p>Ingra a Prisoner</p><p>THE way once pointed out, however, we never </p><p>swerved aside, and Edmund worked up the </p><p>speed to as high a point </p><p>miimmgiuKsmmmittmmm as he deemed safe in that </p><p>dense atmosphere, which </p><p>seemed to flow in trans- </p><p>lucent waves about the </p><p>sides of the rushing car. </p><p>At last I asked Edmund </p><p>what he intended to do </p><p>with the prisoner. </p><p> ‘Til put him behind</p><p>bars.” he replied grimly, </p><p>^	“if I have to construct</p><p>them myself.” </p><p>Notwithstanding our </p><p>great speed, the journey was a long one. We kept </p><p>at an elevation of several miles, in order to com- </p><p>mand a wide view, and the scene was magnificent. </p><p>The wilderness we were leaving behind was in a </p><p>tropical zone, on the borders of that savage region </p><p>where we had encountered the saurian monster, and </p><p>a vast roll of strangely glowing clouds lay upon </p><p>the far horizon. </p><p> But beneath us the country continually improved</p><p> in aspect, signs of cultivation making their appear-</p><p> ance, until at length we began to pass over villages,</p><p> and then over small cities, each of which, in imita-</p><p>597 </p><p>'598 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>tion of the metropolis, had its little group of aerial </p><p>towers, with fluttering banners. Occasionally we </p><p>saw a few airships at a distance, traveling in vari- </p><p>ous directions, and these became more numerous as </p><p>we approached the capital. </p><p> Our approach was not unobserved, and a crowd of</p><p>planes and airships came to meet and escort us as </p><p>we drew near. Our reception at the principal land- </p><p>ing of the great tower was most joyous. </p><p>Back to the City </p><p>THE aerial part of the city seemed suddenly to </p><p>swarm with inhabitants, and the air was filled </p><p>with excited excursionists rushing together from </p><p>all sides. </p><p> On approaching the landing-stage, I saw a throng</p><p>of brilliantly dressed people and officials awaiting us </p><p>with welcoming smiles and gestures, and among </p><p>them, to my great pleasure, I noticed Juba, standing </p><p>in the foremost rank, treated with evident respect, </p><p>and showing every sign of joy on his broad, hairy </p><p>face. We had been absent not more than twenty- </p><p>four hours, but we were greeted as warmly as if our </p><p>stay had been a year. </p><p> No sooner was the car well over the landing than</p><p>Edmund brought it to rest upon the broad plat- </p><p>form, and threw open the door. Jack and Henry </p><p>were the first to alight. The maid followed them, </p><p>and I came next. </p><p> Edmund lingered a moment to secure something</p><p>in the mechanism, and Ala stayed near him, while </p><p>Ingra was behind them. </p><p> During the trip I had not liked Ingra’s conduct;</p><p>though, I confess, I do not know exactly how he </p><p>could have pleased me in his bearing. But, at any </p><p>rate, I felt an indefinite sense of anxiety whenever I </p><p>glanced at him. He remained all the while in moody </p><p>silence, occasionally looking at Ala in a way I did not </p><p>fancy, but most of the time fixing his eyes covertly </p><p>upon Edmund, whose every movement he watched </p><p>as he manipulated the controllers. </p><p> Somehow, he impressed me with the idea that he</p><p>was planning a stroke against us, and when I step- </p><p>ped from the car my anxiety suddenly flashed into a </p><p>vivid apprehension of evil, and I could not resist </p><p>turning back and saying to Edmund: </p><p>“Look out for Ingra, Edmund. He means no good.”</p><p> “Don’t worry. I’ll take care of him,” Edmund re-</p><p>plied, glancing with a smile over his shoulder as he </p><p>tightened a little hand-wheel. </p><p> A moment later Edmund approached the door,</p><p>beckoned to Ala to follow. I saw now that he in- </p><p>tended to leave Ingra in the car until he could ex- </p><p>plain the situation, and provide for his incarcera- </p><p>tion. </p><p> What followed was like a lightning-stroke,</p><p>The Car Is Lost </p><p>I SAW Edmund pitch forward, propelled from the </p><p>car-door as if he had been shot out, and an in- </p><p>stant afterward the door was slammed to, and I </p><p>heard the bars fall into place. </p><p> Edmund recovered himself in a moment, and to-</p><p>gether we sprang at the closed door and threw our- </p><p>selves against it. Of course, we made no impression. </p><p>Edmund’s face was as pale as a sheet. </p><p>“Quick—for Heaven’s sake!” he cried. “Get </p><p>something! Get me a bar! I must break it some- </p><p>how. This is awful! Ala—inside! Can nobody get </p><p>me a bar of steel?” </p><p> The crowd pressed round us, without comprehend-</p><p> ing what was going on. Nobody except ourselves</p><p> knew that Ingra was in the car. Edmund ran to one</p><p> of the windows, but even as he reached it the steel</p><p> shutter was closed with a bang from within, and we</p><p> heard the bolts shoot into their sockets.</p><p> It was the only time in my acquaintance with him</p><p> that I ever saw Edmund Stonewall for an instant</p><p> .jlose his wits. He seemed not to know what to do.</p><p> His face was dreadful to look upon. He pounded</p><p>with his fists upon the steel walls of the car until </p><p>his knuckles reddened. </p><p> As for the rest of us, we knew no more than he</p><p>what to do. The excitement spread to the crowd, </p><p>and they pressed upon Us with wondering looks and </p><p>exclamations. </p><p> A minute or two passed in this helpless agitation,</p><p> and then the car gave a lurch, and a second later it</p><p> rose from the platform!</p><p> Edmund cried out in helpless, passionate fear.</p><p> In a moment the car was a yard above the plat-</p><p>form, and gathering speed. I felt my heart sink. </p><p>Edmund became, if possible, paler than before. </p><p> “Hold it! Hold it!” he shouted, and with him I</p><p>tried to grasp the smooth, polished walls that slipped </p><p>away from our hands. </p><p> At this moment there was a rush in the crowd-</p><p>People were flung aside, and to my amazement, as </p><p>the car rose in the air, I saw Juba make a mighty </p><p>leap, seize the steel grating covering one of the </p><p>windows, and soar away with the machine like a </p><p>huge baboon hanging on the outside of a cage, </p><p> Then the car shot toward the sky!</p><p> CHAPTER XVII</p><p> To the Rescue</p><p>ALOW exclamation, magnified by the mult- </p><p>itude of strange voices into a mighty mur- </p><p>mur, rose from the crowd, and every eye </p><p>followed the retreating car. </p><p> In this emergency all of Edmund’s sagacity and</p><p>Self-command instantly came back. He wa3 once </p><p>more the cool, resourceful master of the situation. </p><p> “An aeroplane!” he shouted, and at the word</p><p>sprang toward one of the floating machines beside </p><p>the landing. </p><p> Brushing aside the engineer, in a moment he had</p><p> the machine in control. Jack and I were upon his</p><p> heels, but Henry was not quick enough, and was</p><p> left behind. There were only four or five men, the</p><p> crew of the plane, on the craft.</p><p> With a skill and rapidity that astonished me,</p><p>well as I knew his capacity, Edmund swung the </p><p>huge machine round and, with reckless disregard </p><p>of consequences, set the driving-screws whirring at </p><p>their highest speed. The great tower seemed to </p><p>melt away behind us, so quickly did we leave it. </p><p> But it was a mad chase.</p><p> A Race Begins</p><p>WHAT could this air-driven craft do against the </p><p>car impelled by the mysterious interatomic </p><p>force? Already the latter was rapidly diminishing </p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE </p><p>599 </p><p> with distance. Still, we could see Juba clinging to</p><p> the window-grating, although at every instant I</p><p> expected him to fall.</p><p> But Edmund would not despair. His eyes shone</p><p>as he drove the machinery of the plane to its ut- </p><p>most limit. The crew were stupefied, and offered no </p><p>opposition. </p><p> ^ “We must not lose sight of them,” said Edmund,</p><p>his self-control becoming more perfect as the </p><p>minutes passed. "We must never lose sight of them </p><p>for an instant.” </p><p> “But surely,” I exclaimed, “you cannot hope to</p><p>overtake them?” </p><p> “Yes,” he said almost fiercely, "I hope even that!</p><p>Remember,” he added more coolly, “that Ingra </p><p>really knows nothing of the management of the con- </p><p>trollers. He has watched me operate them long </p><p>enough to know how to start the car; unless Heaven </p><p>is against us, he will not be able to work it up to its </p><p>best speed, and he can hardly direct it with cer- </p><p>tainty. At any moment he may find himself des- </p><p>cending. Heaven grant that they do not come </p><p>down with a rush.” </p><p> “But there is Ala,” I said. “She knows how to</p><p>manage the machinery. Perhaps he will be com- </p><p>pelled to entrust it to her.” </p><p> Edmund ground his teeth in rage at my words.</p><p> “Yes, Ala is there, a prisoner 1”</p><p> “And Juba,” I added.</p><p> “But how long can he remain on that fearful</p><p>perch? And what can he do?” </p><p> “If they are aware of his presence,” I suggested,</p><p>“perhaps Ala may find a way to communicate with </p><p>him, and aid him in his efforts.” </p><p> The idea seemed to strike Edmund, and he joy-</p><p>fully replied: </p><p> “Yes, yes, surely she will find a way. She is a</p><p>great woman—a woman to trust in an emergency. </p><p>What a brave act that was of Juba's I Who could </p><p>have dreamed that under his shaggy exterior there </p><p>was a heart of gold, and so quick a brain?” </p><p> “He was the head blacksmith in the cavern,” said</p><p>Jack. “If there is any way to get into that car, he</p><p>will find it” </p><p> “It can only be done by aid from within,” replied</p><p>Edmund. “But I trust to Ala. She will find a </p><p>way.” </p><p> “They cannot but be aware that Juba Is on the</p><p>car,” I said. “They must surely hear him, and his </p><p>mere presence will have its effect.” </p><p> “If Ingra does not contrive to throw him off,”</p><p>suggested Jack. </p><p> “He cannot get at him,” was Edmund’s reply.</p><p>“If only he doesn’t lose his breath with the swift </p><p>motion, and if his strength holds out, all may be </p><p>well. But we must keep them in sight. It is our </p><p>only chance, and theirs.” </p><p> The car was now so far away that it looked very</p><p>small; but, being thrown in silhouette against the </p><p>softly glowing cloud-dome—for it was at a greater </p><p>elevation than ours—we could still, with the aid of </p><p>a glass, clearly see Juba clinging to the outside. </p><p> It was a comfort to know that he was yet able to</p><p>retain his perch. If ho could stay there to the end, </p><p>he might be of estimable service when the crisis </p><p>should arrive </p><p>The Question of Elevation </p><p>AT first I was somewhat surprised that Edmund </p><p>kept at so low an elevation compared with that </p><p>of the fleeing car. We were not more than a half- </p><p>mile above the ground, while the object of our pur- </p><p>suit was at least three miles high. But in a little </p><p>while it became obvious that the course which Ed- </p><p>mund had adopted was a very wise one. In the </p><p>first place, by keeping at a low elevation we could </p><p>always see the car projected against the bright sky, </p><p>and there was thus less danger of its escaping us. </p><p> In the next place, as Edmund pointed out, when</p><p>the car came down, as it must do some time, we </p><p>could cut in under it, so to speak, and approach the </p><p>landing-point along a base-line shorter than the </p><p>diagonal that the car would have to pursue. </p><p> “The higher he goes,” said Edmund, “the greater</p><p>our advantage will be. Fortunately, he seems to be </p><p>rising all the time. There is no danger that he will </p><p>run away in that direction. </p><p> “He has no conception of anything above the</p><p>cloud-dome, and his only object is to get as far </p><p>away as possible, in order to defy pursuit before </p><p>landing. I expect every moment, now, to see him</p><p>begin to descend.” </p><p> “But are you sure that he can manipulate the</p><p>controllers well enough to make a safe descent?” I </p><p>asked. </p><p> “Let us pray that he can,” replied Edmund. “I</p><p>will give him credit for great intelligence. If ho </p><p>did not possess extraordinary capacity, he would </p><p>never have learned, simply by watching me, how to </p><p>run the machinery. </p><p> “The fact that he could penetrate so far gives</p><p>me hope, that he has learned enough to insure their </p><p>safety. The highspeed controllers, used when </p><p>astride the atmosphere, are in a different location </p><p>from the others, and are manipulated somewhat dif- </p><p>ferently. </p><p> “I did not touch them during our journey, so that</p><p>I have little fear that he will discover their use. It </p><p>is now evident that we can at least keep the car </p><p>in sight. </p><p> “The resistance of this dense atmosphere is a</p><p>serious obstacle to a machine which, unlike the </p><p>plane, does not derive an advantage from that very </p><p>circumstance.” </p><p>An Alarm </p><p>WE Were now many miles from the capital, and </p><p>traveling toward the tropical belt. It was evi- </p><p>dent that Ingra intended to take refuge again in the </p><p>wilderness, though at a point far distant from the </p><p>place where we had so recently encountered him. </p><p> “Ala has told me,” said Edmund, “that Ingra,</p><p>who is very fond of wild sports, and who until our </p><p>arrival seems to have exhibited no evil characteris- </p><p>tics, has a number of hunting-lodges in this vast </p><p>wilderness, and it was due to the unlucky fate that </p><p>guided us in our descent that we fell into his hands. </p><p> For, unknowingly, we came down within a half-</p><p>mile of one of his lodges. He always has a retinue </p><p>in attendance at his lodges, and probably he is now </p><p>making for one of these places.” </p><p> “Do you think they are aware that we are follow-</p><p>ing?” </p><p>“Of course, they will expect to be pursued, but </p><p>600 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>I am in hopes that Ingra has not seen us, and does </p><p>not know that we have kept within eyesight. You </p><p>remember that the car has no window in the rear— </p><p>a mistake of construction which until now I have re- </p><p>gretted. It has not swerved from its course since </p><p>starting, and I have been careful to keep directly </p><p>behind it. </p><p> “Consequently, there is every reason to think!</p><p>that Ingra, trusting to the speed of the car, has not </p><p>even taken the trouble to look behind. Besides, we </p><p>have kept comparatively close to the ground, where </p><p>it is not easy to see us from a distance, and the </p><p>moment I perceive the car beginning to descend I </p><p>shall run down to the very tree-tops in order to be </p><p>the better concealed.” </p><p> Our hopes now rose high. We had demonstrated</p><p>an ability to keep the car in view, though, to be sure, </p><p>it had become little more than a dark speck in the </p><p>sky, and its steady motion relieved our anxiety con- </p><p>cerning a possible disaster from Ingra’s inability </p><p>to manage it. </p><p> Several hours passed, and once more we had left</p><p>the inhabited lands behind and were passing over </p><p>the border of the wilderness, where the luxuriance </p><p>of the vegetation surpassed that of the Amazonian </p><p>forests of the wilds of Borneo. </p><p> Suddenly, Edmund uttered an exclamation.</p><p> “Great Heavens!” he cried. “Look! Something</p><p>is wrong. It is all to end in disaster at last!” </p><p>Fear of Losing the Car </p><p>JACK and I, startled by Edmund’s agitation, </p><p>glanced at the distant car. It was falling from </p><p>the sky! </p><p> It shot hither and thither, sweeping in long de-</p><p>scending curves, and darting to one side and a- </p><p>nother, like a collapsed balloon. </p><p> “What can have happened?” I exclaimed. “Good</p><p>Heavens! If Juba should be flung off now, our only </p><p>ally would be lost.” </p><p> “No; we have another,” said Edmund quietly, all</p><p>his self-mastery asserting itself—“Ala, herself.” </p><p> “Look,” he continued, a moment afterward, “the</p><p>car rights itself. It will come down all right.”</p><p> It was so. The eccentric movements ceased, and</p><p>we saw the car descending rapidly, but with a </p><p>steady motion which indicated that it was again un- </p><p>der control. During the ten minutes that the wild </p><p>tumble lasted, it had fallen within half a mile of </p><p>the ground, and now it was gliding swiftly away </p><p>from us, over the top of the great forest. </p><p> Edmund strove to increase our speed, making the</p><p>Bilent engineer and his men aid him with their ut- </p><p>most exertions. Glancing behind, I now noticed, for </p><p>the first time, that several airplanes were pursuing </p><p>us; but they were far behind. </p><p> They had probably started in pursuit as soon</p><p>as possible after our chase began, but we had been </p><p>so absorbed in watching the car that we had not </p><p>even thought of looking behind. We had trusted </p><p>entirely to ourselves, but now I felt a satisfaction </p><p>in knowing that we should have assistance in an </p><p>emergency. </p><p> I called Edmund’s attention to our pursuers, but</p><p>he gave no heed. His whole mind and soul were </p><p>fixed upon the car. In a little while it had de- </p><p>scended so low that it became necessary for us to </p><p>rise, in order to keep it in view. </p><p> Nevertheless, as Edmund had foreseen, our course,</p><p>lying so near the ground, had given us a certain </p><p>advantage, and we had drawn preceptibly nearer </p><p>while running for the point toward which the car </p><p>was descending. Still, it now became very difficult </p><p>to keep the object of our pursuit in view. </p><p> At times we lost sight of it entirely against the</p><p>dark background of foliage. But an occasional </p><p>gleam from the polished sides of the car enabled </p><p>us to retain a general notion of its location. </p><p>A Battle </p><p>AT last it dropped into the great sea of vegeta- </p><p>tion, and was completely lost. At this time </p><p>we were apparently, about three miles behind It. </p><p>“Keep your eyes fixed on the point where it dis- </p><p>appeared,” said Edmund. “Don't let your sight </p><p>waver. I shall make straight for the place.” </p><p> Fortune favored us, for at the spot where the car</p><p>had sunk from sight a group of enormous trees </p><p>lifted their mighty tops high above the general sur- </p><p>face of the forest, and this landmark was invaluable </p><p>to us. </p><p> When we had run within an eighth of a mile</p><p>of these trees, Edmund at last slowed up, and got</p><p>the airplane under perfect control. </p><p> We crept silently above the tree-tops, every eye</p><p>fixed upon the spot where we expected at any mo- </p><p>ment to see the car. </p><p> Suddenly a forest glade appeared, shadowed</p><p>by the very trees that had served as our guides, </p><p>and there was the car resting upon the ground! </p><p>The door was toward us, and open. </p><p> In it stood Ala, looking with a horrified coun-</p><p>tenance upon a spectacle that might well have </p><p>frozen her blood. </p><p> Ingra and Juba were engaged in a terrific bat-</p><p>tle. At one moment they rolled upon the ground, </p><p>locked together, looking like a man and a wild </p><p>beast at death-grips. </p><p> Each was fiercely exerting his utmost strength.</p><p>Now one, now the other, was on top. </p><p> Each endeavoring to throttle the other, they</p><p>revolved so rapidly that the eye could hardly </p><p>follow the successive phases of the struggle. </p><p> Suddenly they rolled against a rock, and the</p><p>shock releasing their hold, both leaped to their </p><p>feet. But neither flinched, nor gave back. </p><p> They sprang together again with demoniac</p><p>fury, Juba’s huge eyes blazing out of the wild </p><p>tangle of his hair, while his huge, shaggy arms </p><p>resembled those of a bear rushing madly to the </p><p>death-hug. </p><p> But Ingra was a foe worthy to encounter so</p><p>formidable an antagonist. With amazing </p><p>strength and agility, he hurled his assailant back- </p><p>ward, and then, to my horror, I saw that he had </p><p>his long knife in his hand, while Juba had no </p><p>weapon. </p><p>Juba a Fighter </p><p>LOWERING his form as he sped to the onset, </p><p>and with a wicked lunge, Ingra darted up- </p><p>on his foe. For an instant I thought that the </p><p>blade had reached the vitals of his antagonist, </p><p>for Juba staggered backward, but a second later </p><p>Ingra shot away as if the walking-beam of an en- </p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE </p><p>601 </p><p>gine had struck him, and fell, stunned and mo- </p><p>tionless. </p><p> Juba’s mighty foot had been propelled against</p><p>his chest, for, like a Frenchman, the creature </p><p>fought with arms and legs alike. </p><p> “Now you have him!” shouted Jack, dancing</p><p>with excitement, as Edmund swept the airplane </p><p>toward the spot. “Pin him down! Don’t let him </p><p>up!” </p><p> Juba sprang at his foe, but the latter had been</p><p>driven so far away by the terrible blow that be- </p><p>fore Juba could seize him he had recovered, and </p><p>was on his feet again. </p><p> “Don’t let him get away,” cried Edmund, leap-</p><p>ing from the airplane as it touched the ground, and </p><p>rushing, with Jack and me on his heels, to the scene </p><p>of the encounter. </p><p> But Ingra was too quick.</p><p> Seeing his enemies swarming, he turned and</p><p>ran with the speed of a deer. </p><p> In a second he had disappeared in the under-</p><p>growth, </p><p>CHAPTER XVIII. </p><p>We Find Another Enemy </p><p>AFTER struggling and stumbling through </p><p>the thicket for a few minutes, we gave up </p><p>the chase sooner than we should have done </p><p>on account of Edmund’s anxiety to return to Ala, </p><p>who had remained where we first saw her, stand- </p><p>ing in the door of the car. </p><p> When he stopped, we all stopped; though Juba,</p><p>whose blood was up, would have continued the </p><p>pursuit if he had not been compelled to desist. </p><p>He disregarded the rest of us, but obeyed Ed- </p><p>mund’s call like a faithful hound. </p><p> It was a great disappointment that Ingra had</p><p>escaped, but there was no help for it. We must </p><p>face the consequences, and probably there was not </p><p>one of us who did not feel an unuttered forebod- </p><p>ing of disaster. We had made for ourselves a </p><p>terrible enemy, and it was perfectly certain that </p><p>as long as we remained he would pursue us with </p><p>all the energy of his fiercely passionate nature</p><p>and the resources of his acute mind. </p><p> Edmund expressed this when he exclaimed, on</p><p>our hurried return to the car: </p><p> “That fellow and I cannot both live in this</p><p>world. He will not let me alone, but I will never </p><p>run from him.” </p><p> “Then why don’t you get out of his world?”</p><p>said Jack, who sometimes expressed rather bluntly </p><p>his suddenly conceived notion of right and jus- </p><p>tice. “You are the interloper, not he.” </p><p> “Am I an interloper,” replied Edmund, with</p><p>flashing eye and flushed cheek, “when she”— </p><p>pointing to Ala, who, having heard of our ap- </p><p>proach, came joyously to meet us—“calls upon </p><p>me to defend her?” </p><p> Jack made no reply, but whispered in my ear:</p><p>“Jove! I don’t blame him. I’d die fighting for </p><p>her myself.” </p><p>Ala Once More </p><p>ALA’S beauty seemed tenfold greater in the </p><p>flush of excitement that overspread her features. </p><p>She greeted us with hardly less warmth than she </p><p>bestowed upon Edmund, and the caressing touch </p><p>of her hand on Juba’s hairy arm was a reward </p><p>that the poor fellow plainly accepted in full com- </p><p>pensation for the fearful risk he had run. And </p><p>he deserved her thanks because, but for his pres- </p><p>ence, Ingra would have abducted Ala as soon as </p><p>the car landed, and we should have arrived too </p><p>late. </p><p> We had hardly reached the car again when one</p><p>of the pursuing planes came up, and close after </p><p>it followed several more. They brought a num- </p><p>ber of court officials and attendants, who were </p><p>quite in the dark as to the meaning of this ex- </p><p>traordinary escapade. For, it will be remem- </p><p>bered, there had been no time to tell anybody of </p><p>the presence of Ingra in the car when we arrived </p><p>at the tower. </p><p> Ala explained the situation, and the excitement</p><p>of her friends was laughable. They ran about in </p><p>the underbrush, anxious to show their devotion, </p><p>and possibly thinking that they would find the </p><p>fugitive concealed close at hand. </p><p> But Ala recalled them; and, as more planes</p><p>arrived, organized the search with a rapidity that </p><p>increased my respect for her ability. There was</p><p>one remarkable feature in her intercourse with </p><p>her people that struck me with great force. </p><p> She was a queen, and she had the look and bear-</p><p>ing of one when she chose to assert her author- </p><p>ity; but there was no appearance of servility in </p><p>the manner of those surrounding her, and she de- </p><p>manded none. If ever there was a democratic </p><p>Queen, it was she. Everybody recognized her </p><p>rank, but it was rather with evidences of admira- </p><p>tion and love than of mere submission. </p><p> In a few minutes she had arranged her plan.</p><p>Airplanes were sent scouting over the forest in all </p><p>directions with orders to search every nook where </p><p>Ingra might be in hiding. Then s“he turned to </p><p>Edmund, and they communed together for a time, </p><p>while we awaited the result of their consultation. </p><p> The decision, apparently somewhat against, Ed-</p><p>mund’s opinion, for he wished to aid in the </p><p>search, was to return at once to the capital. Ac- </p><p>cordingly, we embarked in the car; and were soon </p><p>speeding away from the wilderness, leaving a </p><p>dozen of the planes to prosecute the search. </p><p> After our return to the capital a very different</p><p>series of events began to occupy our attention. </p><p> Of Ingra we heard no more, for the present.</p><p>One by one the air planes that had been left to hunt </p><p>him down returned unsuccessful. </p><p> It was certain that he had adherents in the</p><p>city, as he had elsewhere, for his family was very </p><p>old and powerful, and had always occupied an ex- </p><p>alted position; but still we saw nothing to alarm </p><p>us. Nevertheless, we never doubted that he was </p><p>simply biding his time and planning his ven- </p><p>geance. </p><p> To me the thought became an obsession, and</p><p>sometimes I could hardly sleep on account of it. </p><p>It was horrible to think of our being practically </p><p>alone here in this distant world, among a peo- </p><p>ple who knew nothing of our ways, and who </p><p>treated us with respect only because in the first </p><p>place we excited their curiosity, and in the second </p><p>place because Ala's favor was our shield. </p><p>602 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> But I could not get away from the fear that</p><p>when the novelty should be over the romantic </p><p>attachment which their queen had formed for </p><p>Edmund would cease to captivate the public’s </p><p>fancy, and then the scale would incline against </p><p>us. Whenever I broached the subject to Edmund, </p><p>however, he pretended to treat my fears as purely </p><p>imaginary. </p><p>Jack's Tale of His Troubles </p><p>JACK, always impressionable and erratic, quickly </p><p>lost himself in the delights of life in the brilliant </p><p>capital, and could not be brought to think of the </p><p>future. To Henry I dared not open my mind, for </p><p>he was already only too much disposed to brood </p><p>and to take the dark view of everything. If he had </p><p>known my doubts he would have driven me mad by </p><p>magnifying them. </p><p> For a while he tormented us witlTcomplaTnts and</p><p>begged to be taken back to the earth, until Edmund </p><p>turned upon him in such a fury that he never </p><p>again ventured to open his lips on the subject. </p><p> In the meantime it was delightful to watch the</p><p>gracious manner in which Ala sought to distract </p><p>us. </p><p> She began by exhibiting the marvels of the capital.</p><p>Thus far we had only seen the great throne-room, </p><p>the hall of justice, and one or two smaller apart- </p><p>ments in the palace. </p><p> Now she conducted us through halls and rooms</p><p>more splendid than I could have imagined to exist. </p><p>The golden decorations were beyond belief in their </p><p>richness, in the astonishing quantity of the precious </p><p>metal lavished upon them, and in the delicacy and </p><p>beauty of the forms. </p><p> Nothing interested Henry so much as this. It</p><p>stirred his cupidity, which I must confess, although </p><p>I liked him, was a prominent defect of his character. </p><p>“What a place for a Pizarro!” he exclaimed. </p><p> “Yes,” said Edmund, “but there is no cringing</p><p>Atahualpa here. You need not dream of carrying </p><p>off any of this wealth.” </p><p> “But you seem to be in a fair way of falling heir</p><p>to it,” put in Jack with a laugh. </p><p> Edmund colored, but did not reply.</p><p> “For shame, Jack,” I said. “Can’t you remember</p><p>that if Ala does not understand our language, she </p><p>has a marvelous power of reading our thoughts?” </p><p> “That's so,” said Jack. “Upon'my word I feel</p><p>rather uncomfortable In this world where a man’s </p><p>mind goes naked. </p><p> “Why, a little while ago I was strongly tempted</p><p>to steal a kiss from a pretty maid who was showing </p><p>me a wonderful affair of gold and jewels. I don't </p><p>know whether it was an idol or what, and upon </p><p>my word, before I could have made a motion—and, </p><p>of course, I didn’t really mean to—she darted away </p><p>from me as if she had been stung, and her winning </p><p>smiles were changed for a black look that made me </p><p>hang my head.” </p><p> After this we all became a little more circum-</p><p>spect in our comments, and tried to keep our </p><p>thoughts to ourselves, unless, as was generally the </p><p>case, they were such as our entertainers could only </p><p>find pleasure in knowing. </p><p>A Wonderful City </p><p>I should have to write a book to tell you about all </p><p>the surprising things that Ala showed us in </p><p>the palace, and in the city—for we made a tour of </p><p>that also. </p><p> The streets were wonderful, crooked as cow-paths,</p><p>crowded with people, magnificent with shops filled </p><p>with all sorts of curious objects, and bordered with </p><p>thousands of aerial structures that towered up and </p><p>up, glittering like a Jack Frost paradise at Christ- </p><p>mas ; while at all elevations air ships and airplanes </p><p>passed and repassed, steering clear of one another </p><p>with the grace and ease of Venetian gondolas. </p><p> She took us through a great library, where we</p><p>saw the printed books to which I have referred; </p><p>but there was nothing to compare in strangeness </p><p>with the visit which we finally made to a kind of </p><p>temple, where we saw the most remarkable char- </p><p>acter in Venus, the “Head Medicine Man,” as Jack </p><p>facetiously dubbed him. </p><p> But we couldn't remain long in a facetious mood</p><p>■when in the presence of this personage. And, be- </p><p>sides, he gave us a shock, the full nature of which </p><p>I did not comprehend until long afterward, when it; </p><p>came upon me with overwhelming force. </p><p> Jack’s title for him may have been sufficiently</p><p>descriptive of his functions. He seemed to be a </p><p>kind of masculine pythoness, and his gloomy,</p><p>cavernous apartment in the center of the temple, </p><p>strangely lighted with huge, dull-red electric globes, </p><p>was apparently a Delphic shrine for the people of </p><p>Venus. </p><p>The High Priest </p><p>IT WAS our first introduction to any thing resem- </p><p>bling superstition among these people, and to me, </p><p>at least, it came as a great surprise, for in this </p><p>world of light, beauty, and harmony, such a thing </p><p>seemed strikingly out of place. The evident awe </p><p>with which Ala regarded this high priest of </p><p>mystery displeased me also. </p><p> Contrary to what one might expect, this man, who</p><p>was of extraordinary stature, I should say nearly </p><p>seven feet tall, showed no signs of age. He seemed </p><p>to be in middle life, and very vigorous; and, as he sat </p><p>on a kind of throne of some black, highly polished </p><p>metal, with his elbow resting on a short pillar cap- </p><p>ped with a circlet of red jewels that blazed like </p><p>living coals, his huge head and strong face were </p><p>marvelously impressive. </p><p> I never saw such a face anywhere else. It was</p><p>beardless, and as white as marble. Usually he al- </p><p>lowed only his profile to be seen; and one could not </p><p>look upon it without a creeping of the nerves. His </p><p>nose was immense, resembling a great curved beak, </p><p>and his deep-sunk eyes, roofed with projecting </p><p>brows, were as black as jet, but curiously luminous </p><p>as they gleamed sidewise out of their pent-house. </p><p> But when he turned his full face, even Edmund</p><p>started back. He seemed to project his countenance </p><p>toward us like a monstrous bird stretching out its </p><p>neck, and his glowing eyes appeared to penetrate </p><p>our inmost thoughts. </p><p>This lasted only for a moment; and then he </p><p>turned his profile again and remained motionless. </p><p> Ala then had a long communication with Edmund,</p><p>at the end of which he turned to us and said: </p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE </p><p>603 </p><p> “This is the most remarkable thing that we have</p><p>yet encountered. It seems that this is the center </p><p>of their religious system, and that strange man is </p><p>its head. It is, as far as I can make out, based upon </p><p>a kind of sun-worship. </p><p>The Sun and Venus </p><p>“AT rare intervals the cloud-dome opens over- </p><p>head in a narrow rift, through which the sun </p><p>appears for a few moments, as a vast, blinding ball </p><p>of fire; larger and brighter, of course, than we ever </p><p>see it from the earth. Sometimes a whole genera- </p><p>tion passes without this momentary opening of the </p><p>heavens. </p><p> “Ala herself has never seen the vision of the</p><p>bright god of the sky; but, like all her people, she </p><p>regards it as a manifestation of a higher govern- </p><p>ing power, and every time that the phenomenon oc- </p><p>curs there is an extraordinary outburst of enthu- </p><p>siasm, which arrests all other affairs, and the whole </p><p>planet is swept by a wave of religious frenzy. </p><p> “This high priest is regarded as the mortal repre-</p><p>sentative of the power above. Upon his death an- </p><p>other, chosen by what I suppose may be called a </p><p>council of augurs, takes his place. He has all the </p><p>sacredness and influence of a Delphic oracle, and </p><p>his utterances are considered as sure prophecies </p><p>of future events.” </p><p> “I’d never come to him for a fortune,” broke In</p><p>Jack. “I don’t like his looks.” </p><p> “Hush! But that’s just what you have come for,”</p><p>replied Edmund with a smile. “And I don't know </p><p>how the thing is going to work out for us. AI$ </p><p>has brought us here to learn this priest’s opinion </p><p>about—well, about me. You will understand. If </p><p>he proves unpropitious, it won’t be well. I hope for </p><p>a favorable oracle.” </p><p> This put an entirely new complexion upon the af-</p><p>fair, and I began to regard the occupant of the* </p><p>black throne with an apprehension that I had not </p><p>felt before. I could have wished our fate to lie </p><p>in anybody’s hands but his. I quite agreed with </p><p>Jack on that point. </p><p> I wondered why Ala had not consulted this</p><p>authority earlier, if she did not feel free to make </p><p>her own choice and act her own will. Now that we, </p><p>through Edmund, were so deeply involved, the con- </p><p>sequences could not but be very serious if another</p><p>adverse influence besides that of Ingra was directed </p><p>against us. </p><p> But I suppose the girl queen had simply followed</p><p>the dictates of her heart at first, and then events had </p><p>so crowded upon one another that there was no op- </p><p>portunity to take counsel. </p><p> We were not compelled to wait long to discover</p><p>the trend of the oracle. The beaked face and the </p><p>jetty eyes were turnd upon us again, and without </p><p>warning the gigantic form rose to its full height. </p><p>One arm was thrown out toward us in a gesture of </p><p>repulsion, while the eyes blazed from the out-thrust </p><p>colorless countenance so fiercely that, in spite of all </p><p>my efforts at self-command, I absolutely quailed </p><p>before them. </p><p> Henry started back, and would have fled incon-</p><p>tinently if Edmund had not seized his arm and de- </p><p>tained him. Juba alone, to my surprise, remained </p><p>totally unmoved. Either he did not understand, or </p><p>else he had unwavering confidence in us, and so </p><p>feared nothing. </p><p>Ala Defiant </p><p>ALA, for a moment, was overwhelmed with seem- </p><p>ing disappointment and sorrow. Then she </p><p>slowly raised her head, her cheeks reddened, her </p><p>eyes shone with a determined look, and, meeting </p><p>the glance of the great priest unflinchingly, she laid </p><p>her hand on Edmund’s shoulder. I saw a mingled </p><p>look of pride, love, and defiance pass over Edmund’s </p><p>features; and then he faced the new enemy he had </p><p>found with a firm glance. </p><p> “Now we are in for it,” whispered Jack. “If Ed-</p><p>mund pulls us out of this, I’ll swear by him for- </p><p>ever.” </p><p> But the immediate consequences were not so</p><p>serious—at least, in appearance—as our fears had </p><p>anticipated. </p><p> The priest, from his towering elevation, glanced</p><p>scornfully at Ala; and then, in a low, monotonous </p><p>tone, began a kind of chant. Only Ala, of course, </p><p>understood him; but, as she listened, an expression </p><p>of growing horror came over her face. The scene </p><p>lasted only two or three minutes. When the chant </p><p>was finished, the oracular speaker slowly sank back </p><p>upon his throne and turned away his face, which </p><p>had become once more as impassive as marble. </p><p> Ala could hardly remain upright. She leaned</p><p>on Edmund’s arm, and, as I thought, sobbed.</p><p> Suddenly she straightened. The queenly look</p><p>and manner returned. Her whole bearing and ex- </p><p>pression denoted resistance and resolution. Turn- </p><p>ing her back upon the black throne, without another </p><p>glance at its occupant, but with a look at Edmund </p><p>—in which her inmost soul shone forth in a way </p><p>that there was no mistaking—she led us from the </p><p>chamber. </p><p>The Priest’s Prophecy </p><p>WHEN we were alone afterward in an apart- </p><p>ment in the palace, Edmund told us the </p><p>meaning of what had occurred. </p><p> “That the decision was adverse,” he said, “I need</p><p>not tell you. We have got the religious head of the </p><p>planet against us now. But his closing speech, </p><p>which Ala has explained to me as best she can, was </p><p>a queer medley—-a sort of prophetic vision, it would </p><p>seem—which greatly affects Ala, though for my part </p><p>I only laugh at it.” </p><p> “But what was it?” urged Jack.</p><p> “Oh,” said Edmund, “only a crazy Mother Shiptofl</p><p>jumble of nonsense. He talked about a grand con- </p><p>flagration and a general wiping out of things and </p><p>persons that he doesn’t like. I snap my fingers at </p><p>his divination, but without any mumble magic he </p><p>can do us a lot of harm. If I could persuade Ala </p><p>to go, I'd quit Venus within twenty-four hours. </p><p>But I don’t believe she’d consent to go, and I won’t </p><p>leave her, so that’3 the end of it.” </p><p> Henry groaned in spirit, but Jack showed no</p><p>white feather, and I don’t believe I did either. </p><p> “Bully for you, Edmund 1” Jack cried. “Go in and</p><p>win. We’ll stand by you, if we never see old New </p><p>York again.” </p><p> Edmund smiled with gratification, and grasped</p><p>us each warmly by the hand. </p><p>604 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>CHAPTER XIX </p><p>An Extraordinary Hunt </p><p>THE significance of what had occurred in the </p><p>temple gradually dawned upon me after- </p><p>ward, but it was never so clear in my mind </p><p>as to produce more than an uneasy and growing </p><p>foreboding. </p><p> Edmund did not mention the subject again, and</p><p>there was no outward manifestion of the new op- </p><p>position which had been set up against us. Natural- </p><p>ly, it would require time to develop its force. It </p><p>was a struggle between two opponents of equal </p><p>power, for if the “Big Medicine Man,” as Jack con- </p><p>tinued, to call him, was supreme in religious affairs, </p><p>Ala was nevertheless queen, and her popularity was </p><p>a bulwark to her authority. </p><p> Besides, so far as we knew, the affair was a secret</p><p>known only to the persons immediately concerned. </p><p>There had been no witnesses of the scene before the </p><p>black throne. </p><p> In the meantime, Ala showed as little anxiety as</p><p>Edmund. She was almost continually with us, and </p><p>the time glided away very pleasantly With the enter- </p><p>tainments which she was constantly providing for </p><p>our amusement. </p><p>Color Music </p><p>OUR attention was now once more turned to the </p><p>mystery of the color music. It was perfectly </p><p>clear, after what we had learned in the wildness, </p><p>that the play of colors which had so astonished us </p><p>furnished but a part of the esthetic enjoyment of </p><p>these people. </p><p> Frequently there were what I may call concerts</p><p>in the palace, and on these occasions I became con- </p><p>vinced that more than half of the effect produced by </p><p>the dramatic harmonies that gushed in glowing </p><p>waves of color from the great circles on the walls </p><p>was due to the production of sounds inaudible to </p><p>us. </p><p> Edmund, as I had anticipated that he would do</p><p>from his remark in reply to Jack’s enthusiastic de- </p><p>mand when the secret of the singing birds first </p><p>burst upon us, attacked the problem by rendering </p><p>this strange music audible to us. And he succeeded, </p><p>as he always succeeded. </p><p> How he did it I cannot pretend to explain, but</p><p>he said that it was as simple in principle as a tele- </p><p>phone. After many experiments he constructed </p><p>three little boxes, one for each of us, and when we </p><p>had attached them over our ears we could actually </p><p>hear the sounds produced by the colored undulations. </p><p> I can never describe those sounds. They thrilled</p><p>the very soul. They had a strange aerial quality, as </p><p>if they were the voices of spirits floating in the air </p><p>about us. The music that they produced reminded </p><p>me, by the sweetness of its melodies, of an iEolian </p><p>harp; but it was more measured, and infinitely more </p><p>varied. Listening to it, we felt stirred to depths of </p><p>our being of whose existence we had not dreamed. </p><p> We were exalted, and something beyond human</p><p>capacities of enjoyment seemed to have been given </p><p>to us. Yet Edmund said that the exquisite pleasure </p><p>we were enabled to experience by the aid of his con- </p><p>trivances was only a rude, imperfect, mechanical </p><p>reproduction of that which was enjoyed by the </p><p>people of Venus. But we were grateful to him for </p><p>affording us this glimpse into the possibilities of a </p><p>transcendent development of the physical senses. </p><p> “It is the nature of Venus,” Edmund declared.</p><p>“This world so near the sun receives from the great </p><p>orb richer gifts than come to the earth. The at- </p><p>mosphere here is tremulous with vibrations orig- </p><p>inating in the sun, which impart a character to </p><p>the physical organization of the inhabitants of this </p><p>planet which we can hardly imagine. Their joys are </p><p>at the same time more delicate and more intense </p><p>than ours.” </p><p>An Exploring Party </p><p>WE were never tired of tasting the hew pleasure </p><p>that had been partially placed before us, but </p><p>Edmund’s restless spirit soon drew us away into </p><p>fresh adventures. </p><p> He was determined to explore the torrid circle.</p><p>He had learned from Ala that no one had ever been </p><p>able to penetrate beyond the place where Ingra had </p><p>left us to be devoured by the monsters of the great </p><p>swamps; but with his car he believed that we could </p><p>go wherever he chose, and he persuaded Ala, whose </p><p>desire for knowledge and love of adventure were* </p><p>not less than his, to consent to a most extraordinary </p><p>expedition. </p><p> In the preparations for this I believe that we all</p><p>forgot the new danger that threatened us since the </p><p>opposition of the Great Oracle had been declared. </p><p> Whatever might be the form that danger was to</p><p>assume, it kept itself in the background and worked </p><p>in secret. I had an uneasy feeling that in some </p><p>manner Ingra would associate himself with it. </p><p> While the people, and even the high officials in</p><p>the palace, apparently knew nothing of what had </p><p>occurred, I felt certain tha£ our arch-enemy would </p><p>learn of it and remorselessly pursue the advantage </p><p>that it gave him. </p><p> Again and again I was on the point of urging</p><p>Edmund to leave the planet while there was yet </p><p>time and take Ala with us, if she would consent to </p><p>go, as he had himself suggested. He was so ab- </p><p>sorbed in his schemes, however, that I hesitated </p><p>to disturb his thoughts. </p><p> In a short time all our preparations were made,</p><p>and we set out on what I must regard as the wildest </p><p>and most inconsiderate adventure that we had yet </p><p>undertaken. </p><p> We started, as usual, from the great tower of the</p><p>palace, our company consisting of eight persons, all </p><p>that the car could conveniently accommodate. These </p><p>comprised, beside ourselves, Ala, Juba, two maids </p><p>chosen from Ala’s immediate attendants, and a high </p><p>official of the palace—a sort of majordomo—a very </p><p>intelligent person and of great physical strength. </p><p> Of course we had our weapons, both the pistols</p><p>and the guns, with an abundance of ammunition </p><p>and of provisions. We were attended by half a </p><p>dozen airplanes, which were to accompany us as </p><p>far as they could go, and were there to await our </p><p>return from the unknown region. </p><p>The Wonders of Venus </p><p>WE took the direction of the mines; and beyond </p><p>them we entered the wilderness, and soon </p><p>found ourselves involved in the zone of clouds and </p><p>semi-darkness. Here, at a point where a curiously </p><p>shaped mountain peak, rising just on the border of </p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE </p><p>the twilight-land and pointing its bold outlines </p><p>against the strongly illuminated sky behind, </p><p>served as a landmark which we could not miss on </p><p>our return, the airplanes were ordered to await us, </p><p>and we pushed on alone with the car. </p><p> Jack, of course, was all alive for this adventure,</p><p>as he always was for anything promising excite- </p><p>ment; but Henry didn’t like it, and would have </p><p>stayed behind if he had had the courage to remain </p><p>alone among strangers. For my part, my curiosity </p><p>was greatly aroused; and, besides I found immense </p><p>interest in watching the enthusiasm of Ala. </p><p> Her adventurous spirit was in its element; and,</p><p>as far as appearances went, she gave no thought to </p><p>future troubles. According to custom, the control </p><p>of things at the capital had been left in charge of </p><p>a sort of board of regency, which was a permanent </p><p>institution, as I learned, Ala not being the first </p><p>queen who was fond of visiting distant parts of the </p><p>country, though she was the first who had shown a </p><p>disposition to explore unknown regions. </p><p> On leaving the airplanes behind, we plunged</p><p>deeper and deeper into gloom, and were compelled </p><p>to use our electric lights. Among Edmund’s special </p><p>preparations was a small search-light, placed at the </p><p>peep-hole in the front end of the car, and this was </p><p>now brought into requisition. </p><p>&lt; It gave us startling views of the nature of the </p><p>surface beneath. </p><p> First we ran for many miles above an area</p><p>covered with vast swamps and bogs, with the </p><p>oddest conceivable shapes of vegetation. We were </p><p>keen to see some of the gigantic animals which we </p><p>knew, from our first startling experience, inhab- </p><p>ited this region, and it was not long before the light </p><p>found one out. </p><p> We were about a hundred feet above the ground,</p><p>and proceeding slowly, when Edmund, who had </p><p>placed himself beside the search-light and was peer- </p><p>ing through the opening, said quietly: </p><p> “There! Would you like to take a look?”</p><p> Ala was beside him in a moment, and she could</p><p>not repress an exclamation, or refrain from starting </p><p>backward, although in a second she recovered and </p><p>laughed at her own nervousness. There was room </p><p>for only one, beside Edmund, at the little window, </p><p>and when Ala had satisfied her curiosity we each </p><p>took our turn. </p><p> When mine came I was for an instant almost as</p><p>much agitated as Ala had been. </p><p>A Strange Monster </p><p>DIRECTLY ahead of us, not more than seventy- </p><p>five yards distant, there was a shallow pond, </p><p>its banks thick with tangled bushes, and in the </p><p>midst of it stood a monster on eight legs, tawny- </p><p>colored in the electric light, seeming to bristle with </p><p>stiff hairs all over its huge round body. Its head was </p><p>relatively small, black, and apparently armored with </p><p>polished jet, and faceted with innumerable eyes, </p><p>which flamed in the brilliant beam poured upon </p><p>them. </p><p> “Good Lord!” I could not but exclaim. “It is</p><p>like a prodigious tarantula! Look! It is going to </p><p>leap at us!” </p><p> “Upon my word,” said Edmund, “I think the fel-</p><p>low does mean fight. Get away a moment, and I’ll </p><p>swing the car round. We’ll give him a broadside </p><p>if he becomes too ugly.” </p><p> _ Accordingly, the car was swung into such a posi-</p><p> tion that one of the side windows faced the crea-</p><p> ture, and Edmund brought the movable search-light</p><p> to the window, which he threw wide open.</p><p> “For Heaven’s sake!” cried Henry. “Don’t do</p><p> that. He’ll get at us.”</p><p> “Don’t be alarmed,” Edmund replied, “He can do</p><p> us no harm. We are two hundred feet away.</p><p> All of us crowded about the window, and it is</p><p> unnecessary to say that the automatic guns were</p><p> in our hands and the pistols ready.</p><p> During the few seconds that the streaming light</p><p> had been removed the monster had changed his</p><p> position; and now, as the glare fell upon him again,</p><p> we were startled to find that he had approached us.</p><p> He was within forty feet of the car, standing in a</p><p> grassy glade, having with inconceivable rapidity</p><p> and agility clambered or leaped over the stunted</p><p> trees and bushes surrounding the pond in which we</p><p> had first seen him.</p><p> His huge spiky body seemed to bristle with anger,</p><p> and his countless eyes blazed like so many great</p><p> rubies in the piercing light. It was truly a heart-</p><p> quaking sight!</p><p> Ala started back with a womanly cry of alarm;</p><p> and Henry, I am almost ashamed to say, sank help-</p><p> less upon a bench.</p><p> “I believe he is going to jump at us,” said Ed-</p><p> mund quietly. “Aim for his head, and let him have</p><p> half a dozen shots in quick succession.”</p><p>Jack’s Narrow Escape </p><p> T) EFORE anybody could touch a trigger the aw-</p><p> ful creature bounded with lightning speed upon</p><p> the car.</p><p> If you have ever seen a “hunting-spider” leap up-</p><p> on a fly, you know the incredible rapidity of its</p><p> spring and its stroke. This monster was no less</p><p> swift in his action.</p><p> Through sheer nervous shock we simultaneously</p><p> discharged our guns; but without aim, and, un-</p><p> fortunately, without effect.</p><p> The monster struck the car with a force that</p><p> made it roll back, and two shaggy legs entered the</p><p> window.</p><p> A yell of horror and terror broke from Jack’s</p><p> lips, and in an instant he was dragged from the</p><p> window, our terrible assailant dropping out of sight</p><p> at the same moment!</p><p> Edmund sprang to the controllers, and the car</p><p> sank swiftly to the ground. As we landed in a</p><p> tangle of bushes, Edmund leaped out into them,</p><p> calling to me to follow. Then the light streaming</p><p> from the open window fell upon the most awful</p><p> spectacle that a man ever lived to tell about.</p><p> The monster was within twenty feet of us, hold-</p><p> ing Jack high above the ground with the claws of</p><p> two of its legs, and turning him round and round,</p><p> as a spider prepares a fly for his meal.</p><p> The dreadful jaws were open to receive the</p><p> morsel, when a stream of fire shot from Edmund’s</p><p> gun, followed instantly by half a dozen more.</p><p> The animal reeled, and its legs gave way, thrash-</p><p> ing the bushes as it tumbled on its side.</p><p> Jack dropped like lead, and I rushed to his side,</p><p> while Edmund pumped more shots into the huge</p><p>606 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> rolling body, whose struggles broke the inter-</p><p> twining branches with terrible crashes.</p><p> As I reached Jack he resembled a shapeless lump.</p><p>Edmund rushed back as soon as he could to look </p><p>at him. </p><p>CHAPTER XX </p><p>In the Whirlwinds of Venus </p><p>UT the case proved, on examination, not to </p><p>be so bad, after all. </p><p> Jack was not dead, and the great beast</p><p>was. </p><p> Still, the poor fellow seemed terribly injured.</p><p>His clothing was ripped to shreds, and his face was </p><p>disfigured. He had been rolled up almost into a ball; </p><p>and I marveled when I saw him stretch out his legs, </p><p>for I thought that every bone must have been </p><p>broken. </p><p> His athletic training had, perhaps, saved him, his</p><p>joints being supple and his muscles elastic. </p><p> "Just in time,” he muttered, trying bravely to</p><p>smile. “He had me in his jaws once, but I kicked </p><p>away.” </p><p> As we lifted him between us to carry him back</p><p>to the car, Ala approached, pushing her way with </p><p>anxious face through the tangle of weeds and </p><p>shrubs. Juba, his great eyes shining like flames, </p><p>was close behind her. </p><p> Ala uttered a cry of joy when she saw that we</p><p>were safe, but her face was filed with pity as her </p><p>eyes fell upon Jack. She helped Juba to open a way </p><p>for us back to the car. </p><p> No sooner had we placed the injured man on the</p><p>floor than she was on her knees beside him, striv- </p><p>ing to stanch the wounds on his face and hands. </p><p>She and Edmund worked together as if they had </p><p>been trained nurses. </p><p> They tore up garments to make bandages, and</p><p>in a little while Jack looked like a patient in an </p><p>emergency hospital. Fortunately, he seemed to </p><p>have no internal injuries; and Edmund declared </p><p>that, barring the possibility of poison from the </p><p>fangs, there was no danger of a fatal result. </p><p>Jack’s Courage</p><p>NEVERTHELESS he said, we must start on our </p><p>return at once. </p><p> “Not on your life!” Jack exclaimed. “See here,</p><p>Edmund, I won’t go back. This expedition is not </p><p>going to be ruined on account of such a little ac- </p><p>cident. It’s just beginning to get interesting.” </p><p> “But you may be poisoned,” said Edmund.</p><p> “Stuff and nonsense!” returned Jack. “There’s</p><p>no poison about it. I tell you I won’t go back. I’m </p><p>not going to be scared out by a beast like that. </p><p>You’ve finished him, and that ends it.” </p><p> At first Edmund insisted; but Jack was so ob-</p><p>stinate, and he really seemed so strong, that at </p><p>length Edmund said: </p><p> “Well, we'll go on a little way. If Jack seems to</p><p>be the worse for it, we’ll put back again at top </p><p>speed.” </p><p> So it was decided, and we kept on.</p><p> No one had any desire to examine the monster</p><p>we had slain. But Edmund declared that in the </p><p>interests of science he ought at least to photograph </p><p>him with a flash-light; and we did pause long enough </p><p>for that, hovering over the place with the car, but </p><p>the picture when developed showed nothing but a </p><p>blur. </p><p> No other adventure happened at once, and we</p><p>saw no more of the strange inhabitants of the fens, </p><p>who had probably been scared off by the noise and </p><p>the light. </p><p> For a long time we bore away in the darkness,</p><p>without any guide except a general sense of direc- </p><p>tion. In that respect Edmund was the most re- </p><p>markable person I have ever known. It seemed </p><p>impossible for him to be lost. He could make his </p><p>way through the air like a migrating bird. </p><p> After a long while it began to grow a little lighter</p><p>ahead. I though that we had inadvertently turned </p><p>on our course and were approaching the temperate </p><p>zone; but Edmund averred that he had not lost </p><p>his direction, and that the light must come from </p><p>some other source. Before the darkness around us </p><p>had begun perceptibly to lift I happened to glance </p><p>out of one of the windows, and noticed a strange </p><p>fluttering in the air. </p><p> Huge inky shadows seemed to be flitting through</p><p>the gloom. </p><p>Strange Shadows </p><p>PRESENTLY there cams a smart blow against </p><p>the car, and for an instant something covered </p><p>the window. Everybody was greatly startled, and </p><p>we looked out at both sides, but could see nothing, </p><p>except the curious shadows that I had first noticed. </p><p> The air was misty around us; and the shadows,</p><p>except for their blackness, resembled apparitions </p><p>like the spectre of the Brocken, cut upon the dark </p><p>fog by moving objects, whose position we could not </p><p>immediately determine. </p><p> “There is something odd overhead,” said Ed-</p><p>mund at length, "and I’ll steer a little higher to see </p><p>what it is.” </p><p> No sooner had the car started gliding on an up-</p><p>ward slope than a perfect thunder of raps began </p><p>on the outside, like heavy hail on a roof. At the </p><p>same time both of the windows were covered by </p><p>moving forms, the nature of which we could not </p><p>determine, so fast did they flit by. </p><p> But it was evident that they were hitting the</p><p>car and causing the noise. Suddenly the rapping </p><p>ceased and the forms disappeared from the win- </p><p>dows. But now again the ebon shadows began </p><p>fluttering in the mist all about the car. </p><p> “What has become of those things, and what are</p><p>they, anyhow?” demanded Jack nervously. Owing </p><p>to his comparative helplessness, he was no doubt </p><p>more startled and alarmed than he would otherwise </p><p>have been. </p><p> “I don’t know what they are,” Edmund replied;</p><p>“but I do know that they are overhead again, and </p><p>I’m going to keep the car rising until I find out </p><p>what the mystery means.” </p><p> “But what makes the shadows?” I asked. “Where</p><p>does the light come from?” </p><p> “Of course it must come from above,” Edmund</p><p>replied, “since the shadows are below our level and </p><p>appear all around us. I take it that the sun is </p><p>breaking through the clouds overhead. But what </p><p>the objects are that cast the shadows I can’t guess. </p><p>That they are very much alive, and that their name </p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE </p><p>607 </p><p>is legion, are facts which require no demonstration </p><p>after our recent experience.”	a</p><p> All this time we were rising, and in a few’ mo-</p><p>ments the strange phenomenon recurred. The </p><p>thunder of blows again fell upon the car, and the in- </p><p>distinguishable rush by the windows was resumed. </p><p>Ala turned slightly pale, her maids cowered to- </p><p>gether, Henry hid his face, and even Edmund </p><p>seemed disconcerted. </p><p> “It’s very strange,” he muttered. “I’ll have to</p><p>turn on the search-light.” </p><p>A Flock of Bats </p><p>THIS had been extinguished upon the closing of </p><p>the glass of the window when we resumed our </p><p>journey, Edmund not taking the trouble then to </p><p>replace the apparatus at the forward lookout. He </p><p>now put the light in its original position, and, as </p><p>its brilliant beam sprang out into the darkness, </p><p>placed himself close by the small opening. After </p><p>a moment of intense gazing he looked back over </p><p>his shoulder with a queer expression. </p><p> Catching my eye, he beckoned to me, and I went</p><p>to his side. </p><p> “Look out there!” he said in a low voice.</p><p> As I did so I was unable to repress an exclama-</p><p>tion. The shaft of light fell upon thousands of </p><p>huge flapping wings, belonging to what I can only </p><p>liken to enormous bats, which were whirling about </p><p>the car and blindly striking by hundreds against </p><p>it, as they rushed on in an endless procession. </p><p> Soon it became apparent that they were revolving</p><p>in a vast circle; and their previous sudden disap- </p><p>pearance was explained when, as if at a signal, they </p><p>all turned their flight upward and rose again above </p><p>the level of the car. </p><p> The things looked so uncanny that I shuddered</p><p>at the recollection of the sight, while Edmund </p><p>seemed lost in thought. </p><p> “What is it?” called out Jack impatiently from</p><p>his bench. “What do you see?” </p><p> While I was trying to frame an answer Edmund</p><p>spoke up in words that filled me with surprise. </p><p> “It’s the next step to Hades, I reckon,” is what he</p><p>said. </p><p> Jack didn’t catch his drift, and I had to think</p><p>a moment before I asked: </p><p> “What in the world do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean this,” replied Edmund, seizing one of the </p><p>knobs and giving it a sudden turn. “We’ve got to </p><p>get up out of here before the tempest strikes us.” </p><p>“You don’t think that they can harm us, do you?” </p><p>I said, with my mind on the flying creatures. </p><p> “Not they, but what they announce. Hold on</p><p>tight now, for I am going to make her spin.” </p><p>Before touching the knob again, he took Ala by </p><p>the band and made her sit on one of the benches, </p><p>showing her how to hold herself firmly in position. </p><p>Then he planted himself by his controllers, and a </p><p>moment later we felt the car bound upward. </p><p>A Tempest on Venus </p><p>BUT the warning which Edmund had read in the </p><p>conduct of the gigantic birds had come too late. </p><p>We shot through their array, knocking them right </p><p>and left by thousands as we rushed upward; but </p><p>the deafening sound thus created was nothing to the </p><p>awful uproar that immediately succeeded. </p><p> I turned dizzy as the car began to spin and plung®</p><p>like a cork in a whirlpool. </p><p> We were caught in a tempest with a vengeance!</p><p>It was getting lighter outside, but the light was </p><p>more fearful than the darkness. It was a lurid red </p><p>gleam that made the boiling clouds which surged </p><p>against the windows resemble foam upon a sea </p><p>of blood whipped to madness by furiously battling </p><p>winds. </p><p> All that we had experienced in the terrible pas-</p><p>sage of the crystal mountains was child’s play to </p><p>this! </p><p> The howling and shrieking of the wind was</p><p>enough to drive one mad. It seemed to blow a </p><p>dozen ways at once. The car rolled, bobbed, tossed, </p><p>and plunged, and, despite all our efforts, we were </p><p>flung upon the floor, striking against one another, </p><p>grasping at supports, out of breath, helpless with </p><p>terror, all shouting at intervals and nobody hearing </p><p>a word in the hubbub of noises. </p><p> Edmund abandoned all efforts to control the car,</p><p>and devoted himself to saving Ala as much as he </p><p>could. </p><p> He held her in his arms, and braced himself in</p><p>a corner where two of the benches running along </p><p>the walls met. Even in that terible excitement I </p><p>noticed a look of confidence in her face as she fixed </p><p>her eyes upon Edmund. Jack suffered fearfully </p><p>from the shocks he received, and I did my best to </p><p>aid him. </p><p> Once I caught Edmund’s eye, and he glanced</p><p>meaningly upward, which I took for an intimation </p><p>that the car was still rising, and that he looked for </p><p>deliverance from our peril in that way. But there </p><p>W'ere certainly times when we plunged downward </p><p>with fearful speed, for we would be almost lifted </p><p>from the floor by the inertia. </p><p> This dreadful scene may have lasted an hour, or</p><p>it may have lasted not more than twenty minutes; </p><p>but it seemed endless. The change came with great </p><p>suddenness. </p><p> One moment we were rolling and pitching, as</p><p>usual, and the next—it was all over. </p><p>The Danger Over </p><p>'"pHE car seemed to have been struck dead, it was </p><p>A so absolutely motionless. At the same instant </p><p>the howling of the wind passed away in a dying </p><p>scream. My ears rang still with the echo, and I </p><p>was too dizzy to stand straight. </p><p> In a few moments it became evident that the mo-</p><p>tionlessness of the car was only apparent. We were </p><p>still rising. Edmund gently placed Ala on a bench </p><p>and went to the controllers. After turning a couple </p><p>of knobs, he faced about with a cheering smile. </p><p> “We are out of it,” he said. “There is no more</p><p>danger. The only thing there w'as to do was to keep </p><p>on rising. We are now above the denser part of the </p><p>atmosphere, and the cyclones are whirling far be- </p><p>neath us. I will bring the car to rest, and if I am </p><p>not mistaken you will look down upon a scene that </p><p>you will not soon forget. </p><p> “I cannot open the air-tight glass shutters,” he</p><p>continued, “because at the elevation where we now </p><p>are the air is too rare especially for Ala and her </p><p>friends—but by inclining the car a little to one side </p><p>we can have a good view.” </p><p>There was an arrangement of movable weights </p><p>608 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>sliding upon bars to produce an inclination toward </p><p>one side or the other; and in a few minutes Edmund </p><p>had the car, which was now practically at rest, so </p><p>canted that one of the large windows afforded a view </p><p>almost directly downward. </p><p>An Amazing View from the Air </p><p>THE spectacle beneath drove the memory of an </p><p>awful experience, for the moment, from the </p><p>minds of all. The sun was shining brilliantly over- </p><p>head, and its light fell upon a raging sea of clouds, </p><p>which, except at their edges, where they were torn </p><p>into flying scud, looked as dense as white molten </p><p>metal. </p><p> A hundred tornadoes appeared to be whizzing at</p><p>once, all turning in the same direction with sicken- </p><p>ing velocity; and where these whirlwinds came to- </p><p>gether, their peripheries moving opposite ways, it </p><p>was as if two gigantic buzz-saws had met, each </p><p>plowing the other to pieces and whirling the frag- </p><p>ments round in the wildest confusion. The play of </p><p>lightning was fierce and incessant; but when we </p><p>were in the midst of it, it had passed unnoticed, the </p><p>thunder being blended with the roar of the wind. </p><p> "Good Heavens!” cried Jack, holding himself pain-</p><p>fully erect at the window. “Did we come through </p><p>that?” </p><p> “Indeed we did,” replied Edmund, “and I don’t</p><p>mind saying that I shouldn’t like to venture such a </p><p>trip again.” </p><p> “But what does it all mean?” I asked.</p><p> “Its meaning is clear enough. In penetrating to-</p><p>ward the torrid circle, where the unsetting sun is </p><p>forever in the zenith, we have entered the zone of </p><p>tempests that surrounds it. The heated air is al- </p><p>ways rising above the area enclosed in the central </p><p>circle and flowing off above on all sides. </p><p> “Colder air rushes in below to take its place; and</p><p>at a certain distance from the center, which we </p><p>have reached, the contending currents come together </p><p>with the results that you see.” </p><p> Ala, who had resumed all of her usual self com-</p><p>mand, was one of the most eager of the watchers of </p><p>this spectacle, and Edmund and she communed to- </p><p>gether for a long time, pointing out and discussing </p><p>the marvelous features of the scene. </p><p> At last I asked Edmund:</p><p> “What do you mean to do next? Go back?”</p><p>“No,” he replied. “At least, we’ll not go back the </p><p>way we came. Having got so far, I think we’ll cir- </p><p>cumnavigate the planet and take a bird’s-eye look </p><p>at it. Jack seems to be getting along pretty well, </p><p>and by keeping near the upper limit of the atmo- </p><p>sphere we can travel so fast that the whole trip will </p><p>not occupy more than twenty-four hours.” </p><p> “That’s it,” cried Jack; “that suits me exactly. To</p><p>go back the way we came would look as if we had </p><p>been beaten.” </p><p> The talk of going back set my mind once more on</p><p>the dangers that were probably gathering for us at </p><p>the capital, and I could not refrain from saying </p><p>quietly to Edmund: </p><p> “You know you ought to get back as soon as pos-</p><p>sible, for I am sure there are plots hatching that </p><p>may have terrible consequences. Remember that the </p><p>eagle beak on the black throne is against us, and </p><p>our absence with Ala leaves him a free field. Ingra, </p><p>too, is at liberty?” </p><p> But Edmund only smiled at my gloomy forebod-</p><p>ings. </p><p> “You borrow too much trouble,” he said.</p><p> But neither he in his buoyant optimism, nor I</p><p>with my half-defined suspicions, foresaw what was </p><p>coming. </p><p>CHAPTER XXI. </p><p>The Land of Night Again </p><p>ALTHOUGH the sun was now continually over- </p><p>head and entirely unclouded, we did not suf- </p><p>fer from its heat, because we were running </p><p>at so great an elevation that the air was rarer than </p><p>on the loftiest terrestrial mountain, and the rays </p><p>that struck the outside of the polished car were re- </p><p>flected off without penetrating. </p><p> But on the planet below us, buried in its blanket</p><p>of heavy air, the effect of the intense and unceasing </p><p>solar radiation was terrific. We had already seen </p><p>one of its results in the belt of cyclones, but as we </p><p>passed over that and entered the central torrid cir- </p><p>cle, we beheld, if possible, still more dreadful in- </p><p>dications of the merciless action of the sun. </p><p> When we had left the region of clouds and storms</p><p>behind, the bare surface of the planet became visi-</p><p>ble, and Edmund kept one side of the car inclined </p><p>downward to give us a better view from the win- </p><p>dow, </p><p>A Desert on Venus </p><p>WE were many miles above the ground, and the </p><p>smaller details were not visible even with our </p><p>binoculars; but we did not dare to drop lower be- </p><p>cause of the heat, which, in spite of our great dis- </p><p>tance, came to our faces, even through the thick </p><p>glass, like the blast of a furnace. </p><p> Evidently, no life could exist on that scorched sur-</p><p>face, and not a drop of water could stay there. Mil- </p><p>lions of square miles of land lay literally roasting, </p><p>and its prevailing dark-brick color suggested the </p><p>idea that it was red-hot. </p><p> There was no temptation to linger here, and in a</p><p>short while we rose entirely above the atmosphere, </p><p>in order, as Edmund said, to make it safe for him to </p><p>turn the “interplanetary knob,” and set the car go- </p><p>ing at a speed of more than a mile a second. In </p><p>this way the transit of the torrid circle, though it </p><p>was thousands of miles broad, was effected in an </p><p>hour, and upon approaching the opposite border we </p><p>saw again the ring of swirling clouds that encloses </p><p>it all round. </p><p> Jack, who was now rapidly recovering the use of</p><p>his limbs, stood with us most of the time at the </p><p>window; and as he saw the clouds passing far be- </p><p>neath, the thought seemed for the first time to strike </p><p>his mind that in circumnavigating the planet we </p><p>should once more visit the scene of our first adven- </p><p>ture on the dark hemisphere. </p><p> “By Jove, Edmund,” he suddenly sang out, “we’ll</p><p>have to cross those mountains again!” </p><p> “Of course we will,” said Edmund, “but it will</p><p>be a simple matter now. We’ll go miles above their </p><p>tops.” </p><p> “And, hooray! We’ll visit the caverns,” Jack</p><p>went on, with rising spirits. “Juba, old boy,” slap- </p><p>ping him on the latter’s hairy back, "you are going </p><p>to see your old home once more, do you understand? </p><p> i</p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE	609</p><p> But we won’t leave you there. No, sirree! We can’t</p><p> part with you. I want to see you in New York once."</p><p> “But, if Juba shmiid want to stay with his friends</p><p> —” I began.</p><p> “Then, he’ll have to stay,” Edmund interrupted</p><p> gravely. “And I am going to advise him to stay.”</p><p> "Aw, Juba won’t want to stay,” said Jack, laugh-</p><p> ing. “He likes our company too well.”</p><p> But Edmund’s words and manner set me to worry-</p><p> ing again about what was going an behind our backs</p><p> at the capital; and I was impatient to return and</p><p> have it out, and then get away for good.</p><p> Edmund saw the trend of my thoughts—I believe</p><p> he was beginning to acquire something of Ala’s</p><p> power of mind-reading—and he said to me, in an</p><p> aside:</p><p> “Don’t be so down-hearted. It’ll come out all</p><p> right. Keep your courage up, and help me with the</p><p> others.”</p><p> We passed over the storm-zone at high speed, and</p><p> then came the temperate, or inhabited, zone; but the</p><p> part of it now beneath our eyes was on the opposite</p><p> side of the planet from the capital. It appeared to</p><p> be dotted with villages; and occasionally the towers</p><p> of a considerable city were visible. Ala, however,</p><p> informed Edmund that this portion of Venus was</p><p> mainly devoted to agriculture, and contained no</p><p> great towers. We were so high that the airplanes</p><p> in sight seemed to be crawling upon the ground.</p><p>Leaving the Night Hemisphere </p><p> A NOTHER belt of clouds ahead soon reminded us</p><p> that we were rapidly approaching the borders</p><p> of the night hemisphere, and our expectations be-</p><p> came eagerly alive. Ala, especially, was nervously</p><p> excitable over the prospect.</p><p> Now, at last, she was to enter that mysterious</p><p> country which none of her people had ever succeeded</p><p> in penetrating, and concerning which so many su-</p><p> perstitions and traditions existed. The majestic</p><p> majordomo, who had behaved with commendable</p><p> equanimity through all of our adventures thus far,</p><p> showed a little nervousness, I thought, when Ala</p><p> explained to him what was about to happen. I</p><p> watched Juba closely, but his face was impassive.</p><p> The night hemisphere, you will remember, is</p><p> ringed outside the crystal mountains by another zone</p><p> of tempests and a broad sea into which the rivers</p><p> periodically formed by the melting ice pour. Wd</p><p> were now so high that the storms did not trouble us;</p><p> and we admired, at our leisure, the shining expanse</p><p> of sea surface, whitened with foam, that showed</p><p> through shifting breaks in the tempestuous clouds.</p><p> Presently, Edmund, who had been watching from</p><p> the lookout, slowed down and swung the car half-</p><p> way round.</p><p> “Now’s your chance,” he said. “Take a look at</p><p> the mountains before we cross them.”</p><p> We all crowded round the window. There they</p><p> lay, those terrific ice peaks, in a long glittering line</p><p> upon the horizon. Their tops were wreathed in</p><p> straggling clouds, through which occasionally darted</p><p> a diamond-bright flash where the level sunlight was</p><p> reflected from some smooth flank of pure ice.</p><p> “I wonder if we can see the place where we were</p><p> imprisoned by the fall of the car?” said Jack.</p><p> “No,” Edmund replied. “That is over on the</p><p> other side. Remember we are approaching the dark</p><p> hemisphere at a point opposite to where we left;</p><p> it.”</p><p> “But the snow mountains' seem just the same</p><p> here.”</p><p>An Arctic Cold on Venus </p><p>ccnpO be sure. Why shouldn’t they he the same? </p><p> The planet is completely ranged wrfch them, for</p><p> the moisture-laden air flows off equally on dll ftfcfes</p><p> of the globe.”</p><p> We were already it sueh an elevation that we</p><p> could clear the mountains and the stowwy ah* ffiat</p><p> raged above their heads; and Edmund, after fifteen</p><p> minutes stoppage, resumed the journey. Gradually’</p><p> a marvelous scene opened around us.</p><p> The air seemed to darken, and the stars began to</p><p> appear. These grew brighter as the night deepened,</p><p> and soon they glowed with inci'eATEle brfBfeitcy. It</p><p> was so long since my eyes had beheld item, that I</p><p> was astonished by their brightness and their mul-</p><p> titude. But the effect upon Ala and her atteniants</p><p> was indescribable.</p><p> You must remember that none of them had ever</p><p> seen a star before, and now suddenly they bcfcdfd</p><p> thousands. They could not comprehend the meaning</p><p> of the wonderful spectacle. It was such a revelaffen</p><p> of the universe as they had never dreamed of.</p><p> When we had passed completely wifcfem ffie realm</p><p> of darkness, with the crystal mountains oifte more</p><p> flaming in fiery shapes behind us, Edinurid brought</p><p> the car to rest.</p><p> He had already started the electric heaters and</p><p> clothed Ala in furs, and now the rest of tfs got out</p><p> our arctic garments from the lockers.</p><p> “I am now preparing to drop down to the ground,”</p><p> Edmund said, “in order to take our bearings. A</p><p> few observations of the stars will enable me to</p><p> orient myself, arid then we can set out with con-</p><p> fidence in search of the caverns.”</p><p> The descent was made rapidly, and then, in our</p><p> warm clothing, we stepped out of the car upon tho</p><p> icy shingle.</p><p> Ala shivered at the touch of the glacial air, and</p><p> her maids and the majordomo quickly fled back into</p><p> the shelter of the car. But Edmund wished Ala to</p><p> remain outside, and he doubled the furs covering her</p><p> until she intimated that she no longer felt any dis-</p><p> comfort from the cold. Then he got out his instru-</p><p> ments of observation.</p><p> But first he pointed out the earth and the moon</p><p> to Ala. That was a thrilling moment to all of us!</p><p> How splendid our old planet looked up there, and</p><p> how proud we felt as we watched Edmund endeavor-</p><p> ing to make his companion comprehend what it was</p><p> that she saw. I think that he succeeded, at least</p><p> so far that she understood that it was our world</p><p> which shone so splendidly overhead.</p><p> “Do you understand what this means?” asked Ed-</p><p> mund, suddenly turning to me.</p><p>“I understand that that is the earth, of course,” </p><p>I replied. </p><p> “But, are you not surprised to find it still so high</p><p> overhead here?”</p><p>Then the truth burst upon me. </p><p>A Year of the Venus Calendar </p><p> «TTfHY, yes!” I exclaimed; “it means that a</p><p> V t whole year has elapsed since we arrived upon</p><p>610 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES. </p><p>Venus. She has gone round her orbit, and con- </p><p>back into conjunction with the earth.” </p><p> “More than a year,” Edmund replied. “Some five</p><p>hundred and eighty days; for that is about the time </p><p>from one conjunction to the next.” </p><p> “Do you mean to say that we have been here al-</p><p>most twenty months?” cried Jack. </p><p> ‘There is the evidence,” Edmund responded. “As-</p><p>tronomy doesn’t lie.” </p><p> “Well,” said Jack, “it’s the shortest twenty months</p><p>in my experience.” </p><p> Henry, after his fashion, said nothing, but looked</p><p>gloomy and disgruntled in the glare of the electric </p><p>light streaming from the car. </p><p> Having finished his observations, Edmund an-</p><p>nounced that he now knew his course and could take </p><p>us directly to the caverns of Juba’s people. But, be- </p><p>fore entering the car, he took Ala again by the </p><p>arm, and they stood together for a long time, gazing </p><p>up at the earth and the stars, while he communed </p><p>with her, telling her, in that strange language, I </p><p>know not what marvelous things which must have </p><p>been revelations of enormous significance to her in- </p><p>telligence. </p><p> I can see them yet, standing there side by side,</p><p>and I can recall the very expression of her beautiful </p><p>eyes, peering out of the hooding furs, as she drank </p><p>in his thoughts, with a look of mingled love, and </p><p>admiration, and confidence. </p><p> At length we reentered the car and, rising to a</p><p>moderate elevation, resumed our journey at a rapid </p><p>pace. The pathless frozen desert beneath us glit- </p><p>tered occasionally in the starlight, and after a long </p><p>time we caught sight of the well-remembered shafts </p><p>of light rising from the ground. </p><p> “We are getting into the inhabited region,” said</p><p>Edmund. “We shall have to search a little for land- </p><p>marks,” he added, “because, of course, my observa- </p><p>tions are not as accurate as those of a geodetic sur- </p><p>vey, and I cannot locate the precise position of </p><p>Juba’s caverns. But I can come very close to them, </p><p>and I depend upon Juba himself to aid in finding the </p><p>exact spot.” </p><p> Since our arrival in the dark hemisphere I had</p><p>frequently studied Juba’s countenance, and I de-</p><p>tected many signs of the interest that the poor fel- </p><p>low experienced in finding himself once more in </p><p>his own land. Still, it seemed to me that Jack was </p><p>right, and that Juba would prefer to stay with us </p><p>than to remain with his people. </p><p>The Caverns Once More </p><p>WE passed over several groups of inhabited </p><p>caverns, but we saw no signs of life except the </p><p>light shafts issuing upward. </p><p> We now ran close to the surface, and kept a</p><p>sharp outlook. Suddenly Juba slapped his hairy </p><p>hands with an expression of delight, and pointed to </p><p>a row of lights which he seemed to recognize. </p><p> “That’s it,” said Edmund. “I was sure he would</p><p>know when he was at home.” </p><p> There was no mistake about it. Juba had recog-</p><p>nized his own village, so to speak, probably by the </p><p>arrangement of the shafts. In a little while, we our- </p><p>selves became aware of a certain familiar aspect of </p><p>the landscape, and, almost without hesitation, we </p><p>approached the mouth of our ovm cavern. Then we </p><p>came softly down to the ground, and the door was </p><p>thrown open. </p><p> “Hold on,” said Jack “let’s give them a surprise.</p><p>Let’s fire a gun in salute.” </p><p> Edmund made no objection, and Jack, who had</p><p>almost entirely recovered his activity, fired the sig- </p><p>nal. </p><p> As the sound rattled through the frozen air, we</p><p>waited with great curiosity, standing within a few </p><p>rods of the terrible altar on which I had nearly been </p><p>sacrificed. </p><p> Presently, two or three hairy heads appeared at</p><p>the cavern’s mouth. Juba immediately ran toward </p><p>them. They disappeared like frightened rabbits, and </p><p>Juba dashed down the steps in pursuit. We halted </p><p>at the top to let him soothe the fears of his com- </p><p>patriots. In a short time he reappeared with a </p><p>dozen companions. </p><p> Evidently he had explained the situation, and I</p><p>was rather surprised at the apparent indifference </p><p>with which they greeted us. We seemed much more </p><p>glad to see them than they were to see us. I recog- </p><p>nized several well-known faces among them. </p><p> Then, accompanied by Ala and her attendants,</p><p>we descended, escorted by Juba, who seemed to take</p><p>great pride in leading us. Arrived at the first un- </p><p>derground apartment, we found a great crowd of </p><p>the hairy natives assembled. </p><p>Juba Meets His Friends </p><p>THE women were more cordial in their greetings </p><p>than the men, and seemed especially interested </p><p>in Ala and her maids. I expected to see some indica- </p><p>tions of concern over the fate of those who had been </p><p>lost in the flood, but I observed none; and I do not </p><p>really know whether or not any explanation of their </p><p>absence was given by Juba. </p><p> While most of our party remained in this cham-</p><p>ber, Edmund took Ala and the majordomo on an ex- </p><p>ploration of the deeper parts of the cavern. Ala </p><p>expressed the greatest interest in everything she </p><p>saw. Edmund told me that he showed her the coal- </p><p>mines, the black-smith shop, and all the curiosities </p><p>of the place. </p><p> But there was no reason for lingering there, and,</p><p>as soon as Edmund had completed his circuit, pre- </p><p>parations were made for our departure. Then Ed- </p><p>mund took Juba aside and tried, as he had said he </p><p>would, to persuade the fellow to remain with his </p><p>own people. But Juba was deaf to all arguments; </p><p>and at last Edmund, throwing up his hands, said: </p><p> “Well, it’s no use. Juba is determined to go back</p><p>with us; so we’ll have to take him.” </p><p> Poor Juba!</p><p> I often think of him now. How infinitely better</p><p>it would have been for him if he had not been so </p><p>fond of the strangers who had dropped into his </p><p>gloomy world out of the starry sky! </p><p> CHAPTER XXII.</p><p>At the Capital </p><p> NEED not detain you with an account of our</p><p> return trip.</p><p> Edmund again laid his course by the stars,</p><p>and running at a high elevation we passed over the </p><p>crystal mountains and their warring tempests, be- </p><p>lieving that we could recogniw with our glasses the </p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE </p><p> huge jeweled peak that had once so nearly wrought</p><p> our destruction. Edmund pointed this out to Ala, as</p><p> she clung to his arm; and then we crossed the sea</p><p> where we had first met her, and were soon coursing</p><p> under the great cloud-dome in the land of filtered</p><p> sunshine.</p><p> Upon reaching the capital, the same scenes of</p><p> jubilation were renewed; but there was great sur-</p><p> prise at our reappearing from exactly the opposite</p><p> direction to that in which we had been expected.</p><p> An airplane was at once despatched to recall those</p><p> who were waiting for us on the border of the twi-</p><p> light zone.</p><p> There can be no doubt that the forebodings which</p><p> had so long occupied my mind tended to color my</p><p> judgment, yet I would have sworn that I detected</p><p> a change in the moral atmosphere of the capital.</p><p> Our greeting from the people was hearty, as usual,</p><p> but there were faces which seemed to me to wear a</p><p> half-concealed scowl; and I caught, occasionally, an</p><p> unfriendly glance in the crowd.</p><p> These things impressed me so deeply that again I</p><p> warned Edmund.</p><p> “The current is beginning to run against us,” I</p><p> told him. “I am sure of it.”</p><p> This time he did not laugh at my fears. On the</p><p> contrary, he said:</p><p> “Yes, I believe you are right. But I am not</p><p> afraid. We have weathered worse storms.”</p><p> “But, what will you do?”</p><p> “Let events take their course, and watch them.”</p><p> “Then you may be too late. Listen to me. Pre-</p><p> pare the car, get Ala's consent to go, for I believe</p><p> she would follow you anywhere, and start for the</p><p> earth at the earliest possible moment.”</p><p> Edmund mused a little while; then he said:</p><p> “The day after to-morrow.”</p><p> “The day after to-morrow?” I replied impa-</p><p> tiently. “Why trifle thus? You know that there are</p><p> no days and to-morrows in this kind of endless</p><p> light.”</p><p> Edmund smiled.</p><p> “Count forty-eight hours by your watch,” he</p><p> said, ‘ and at the end of that time, I promise you to</p><p> start.”</p><p> This promise heartened me immensely. But I did</p><p> not know what that “day after to-morrow” had in</p><p> store. The blow was nearer falling than I could have</p><p> suspected.</p><p> It was hastened without doubt, by an occurrence</p><p> which nobody could foresee or govern, and which,</p><p> if it had happened at the time of our first arrival,</p><p> would probably have had no mischievous conse-</p><p> quences for us.</p><p> But, since that fatal interview in the temple, all</p><p> was changed; and an event more disastrous for us</p><p> than that which now occurred, Ingra himself could</p><p> not have devised.</p><p> The Opening of the Cloud Dome</p><p> TT was the opening of the cloud-dome!</p><p> -*• I have already told you that at certain unpre-</p><p> dictable times a rift appeared in the pearly vault of</p><p> the heavens, and the sun for a few minutes blazed</p><p> down through the opening in unclouded splendor.</p><p> So many years had elapsed since the last occurrence</p><p> of this phenomenon, that for the younger genera-</p><p> tion it was only a tradition; yet it was a tradition</p><p>611 </p><p> on which the pagan religious system—of which the</p><p> eagle-faced sphinx in the red-lighted temple was</p><p> the head-center—was based; and its influence upon</p><p> the ignorant and superstitious multitude was un-</p><p> bounded and irresistible.</p><p> This terrible priest, whose hatred of us had of</p><p> course, been stimulated by Ala's open defiance, had,</p><p> as I feared, occupied the time of our absence in</p><p> poisoning as many minds as possible against us;</p><p> and his sacred character had enabled him to spread</p><p> the venom of religious prejudice with amazing ra-</p><p> pidity. Even if we had not wasted time on our un-</p><p> fortunate expedition, I do not know that we could</p><p> have done much to counteract his pernicious in-</p><p> fluence; but then, at least, we should have been</p><p> ready at an earlier date to escape from his clutches.</p><p> And who knows what Ala, with her great popu-</p><p> tenty might have accomplished if she had been on</p><p> the ground ? I did not doubt for a moment that In-</p><p> gra was in the capital, and thick in the plot.</p><p> The opening of the dome came very suddenly. It</p><p> was announced by a great shout—a rare occurrence</p><p> from the people who happened to be on the outer</p><p> platforms of the palace tower.</p><p> We were all with Ala at the time, Edmund being</p><p> engaged in trying to decipher the curious characters</p><p> in a large book which she had brought him.</p><p> Upon hearing the shout, we all ran out.</p><p> The scene was one of the most unforgettable</p><p> things that occurred in our whole expedition. Ex-</p><p> cited people were crowding the platforms, jostling</p><p> one another, jabbering, pushing, and pointing up-</p><p> ward; some already on their knees, others with looks</p><p> of the utmost consternation, throwing their arms</p><p> wildly above their heads, while hundreds of airplanes</p><p> were circling like frightened birds above the towers.</p><p>The Venerians See the Sun </p><p>T glanced upward, following the direction of thou- </p><p> *	sands of eyes, and was momentarily blinded by</p><p> the fierce glare of the sun, pouring its unmitigated</p><p> rays straight down through a narrow rift in the</p><p> cloud-dome.</p><p> The gold and jewels that decorated the tower mado</p><p> it blaze with a splendor like that of a huge frost-</p><p> gemmed tree struck by the morning rays after a</p><p> winter night’s ice-storm. It wa3 too dazzling to look</p><p> upon.</p><p> Then there was a movement in the vast throng, a</p><p> space cleared itself, and the gigantic augur, wearing</p><p> a great black miter flaming with circles of rubies</p><p> and carbuncles, appeared, his strange beak project-</p><p> ing ominously and his black eyes aglow.</p><p> Thousands instantly dropped on their knees as he</p><p> slowly advanced. With one long arm carrying a sort</p><p> of crozier, he pointed aloft, while he muttered a</p><p> chant that fell like a charm upon the superstitious</p><p> multitude.</p><p> I glanced at Ala.</p><p> She did not stir; and I felt my heart give an ex-</p><p> ultant bound, with the conviction which flashed over</p><p> me that her active, penetrating mind had flung off</p><p> the burden of this superstition. How much Edmund</p><p> had been able to teach her, I do not know; but I</p><p> gave him all credit for the change.</p><p> Soon the terrible priest directed hi3 menacing</p><p> glance upon us, as we continued standing after ali</p><p> the others had abjectly fallen before him.</p><p>612 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> If his eyes had glared before, they turned to liv-</p><p>ing flames now. With a majestic stride, he advanced </p><p>toward Ala; and I thought for a moment that he </p><p>meant to strike her down with his staff. Edmund </p><p>pushed her behind him; and I shall never cease to </p><p>thrill at the recollection that I, with a boldness that </p><p>surprised and gratified me afterward, sprang in- </p><p>stantly to Edmund’s side, with Jack—brave old Jack </p><p>at my elbow. </p><p> What we should have done next I do not know</p><p>for our enemy hesitated. </p><p>An Anathema </p><p>WHETHER he was cowered by our menacing </p><p>aspect, or whether he thought it unbecoming </p><p>his dignity to attack us physically, at any rate, he </p><p>stopped short. Then, towering to his full height, </p><p>he made one vast sweep with his arms, and covered </p><p>us, I suppose, with a withering anathema. </p><p>As far as he was concerned, that apparently ended </p><p> it.</p><p> He paid us no more attention after that than if</p><p>we had been so many sticks, but directed his gaze </p><p>straight at the sun. I saw its rays sparkle in the </p><p>corner of his black eyes, which never winked; and </p><p>I nope I may be forgiven for wishing, as I did, that </p><p>iiis god would strike him blind on the spot! </p><p> As I glanced around, I caught side looks from the</p><p>prostrate worshippers which boded no good. </p><p> Suddenly a cold hand seemed to have been planted</p><p>over the pit of my stomach, for there, lifting his </p><p>head above the kneeling crowd and staring at us </p><p>with a wicked grin, was Ingra! An instant later, </p><p>and before I could speak to Edmund, he was gone. </p><p> Th'is capped the climax of my apprehensions. The</p><p>mere fact that Ingra dared to show himself here </p><p>attested the change that had occurred in our situa- </p><p>tion. After a moment’s thought, I determined not </p><p>to tell Edmund at present what I had seen. </p><p> The spectacle of the opening of the dome ended</p><p>as unexpectedly as it had begun. The rift closed, </p><p>and then, for a few moments, the contrast between </p><p>the unclouded brilliance of the sun and the soft </p><p>glow that succeeded had an effect as if we had been </p><p>plunged into night. </p><p> Finally, objects became clearer, there was a great</p><p>movement of the closely packed throng, the people </p><p>rose from their knees, and the black priest had gone </p><p>as mysteriously as if he had been snatched up into </p><p>the sky. </p><p>CHAPTER XXIII. </p><p>The Blow Falls </p><p>AFTER the scene that I have tried to describe in </p><p>the last chapter, events hurried on with a rapid- </p><p>ity which was not apparent upon their surface. </p><p> I believe that Edmund with all his perspicacity,</p><p>failed to appreciate their meaning. In fact, he was </p><p>himself responsible for giving them an impetus to- </p><p>ward the inevitable crisis, which, but for the prema- </p><p>ture step that he and Ala took, might have been de- </p><p>layed considerably. </p><p> But I shall come to that in a few minutes.</p><p> As the excitement of the crowd died down, the</p><p>people began to move about in groups, communing </p><p>together about the marvel that they had witnessed. </p><p>The unfavorable attitude toward us was spreading </p><p>among them </p><p> It was plain that it had grown enormously in</p><p>strength since the scene with the augur, and the </p><p>impression quickly reached those who had not been </p><p>near enough to see for themselves. </p><p> I could not speak immediately to Edmund, because</p><p>he was continually in conference with Ala; but get- </p><p>ting Jack aside, in order not to alarm Henry, who </p><p>was already in a pitiable state of moral collapse, I </p><p>opened my mind to him. </p><p> “Jack,” I said, “Edmund has promised to get away</p><p>soon.” </p><p> “Well, that’ll be a good thing, I reckon,” was the</p><p>reply. </p><p> “What do you think of the sentiment of this</p><p>crowd?” </p><p> “I shouldn’t like to trust myself alone in it. But,</p><p>say! Didn’t we back the old medicinc-man down in </p><p>great shape?” </p><p> “I don’t think we backed him down at all,” I</p><p>replied. “He has better ways of ruining us than by </p><p>attacking us with a big stick. </p><p> “Humph!” said Jack. “I’d have had the drop on</p><p>him, if he’d made another move.” </p><p> “But you are in favor of our getting away at the</p><p>earliest possible moment?” </p><p> “Oh, yes; I think we’d better go. I’ve had enough</p><p>of Venus. But I’m not for backing down. If Ed- </p><p>mund can take Ala along, all right. That’s a little </p><p>romance that’s got to go through.” </p><p> “We’ve got the religious sentiments of these peo-</p><p>ple against us now,” I said, “and we can’t afford to </p><p>stay an unnecessary minute.” </p><p>The Danger Thickens </p><p>anpHEIR religious sentiments be hanged!” ex- </p><p>i- claimed Jack. “What’s their religion? A set </p><p>of pagans! But, by Jove, these girls of Venus are </p><p>great. I only wish I could have had Edmund’s luck.” </p><p>“He may not be as lucky as he seems,” I re- </p><p>plied. “But, come, Jack, I want you to help me per- </p><p>suade Edmund to start even sooner than he has </p><p>promised—in fact, right away.” </p><p> Jack stared at me a moment.</p><p> “See here, Albert,” he said. “I'm with you in</p><p>thinking that the sooner we’re off the better, but </p><p>I’m not for budging a step until Edmund gives the </p><p>word. He knows his affairs and Ala’s. </p><p> “When they’re ready, off we go, as far as I’m con-</p><p>cerned. But that girl has got to be left to choose </p><p>her time; and, if Edmund wants to stay and become </p><p>King of Venus, I’m not the man to coax him away.” </p><p>There was no more to he made out of Jack. I </p><p>thought it would do no good to tell him that Ingra </p><p>was here, for probably he would be all the more </p><p>eager to stay and fight it out. </p><p> At the first opportunity, however, I brought Ed-</p><p>mund back to the subject of getting away. He saw </p><p>what was in my mind before I could speak. </p><p> “What does your watch say?” he asked good-</p><p>naturedly. “Is it day after to-morrow yet?” </p><p> “No, of course not; but listen, Edmund. Don’t</p><p>you see how the peril thickens around us? I pro- </p><p>test that I am no coward; but it would be defying </p><p>fate to stay here any longer. Can’t you persuade </p><p>Ala to go at once?” </p><p>Edmund paused a minute before replying; and </p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE </p><p>613 </p><p>then he said, with some embarrassment of manner: </p><p>“I promised you to start in forty-eight hours. I </p><p>thought that it could be managed, else I shouldn’t </p><p>have promised; but things have taken another turn. </p><p>Ala refuses to go; and you know,” laying his hand </p><p>on my arm, “that I can’t leave her.” </p><p>Edmund’s Determination </p><p>«T&gt; UT what do you propose, then; to stay here </p><p> -O all your life?"</p><p> “That’s it!”</p><p> There was no trace of regret in his tone. It was</p><p>plain that henceforth this, and not his mother earth, </p><p>was to be Edmund’s world. </p><p> Before I could say anything in reply, he went on:</p><p>“But, of course, I don’t mean to keep you and </p><p>Jack and Henry here. I am going to show you </p><p>exactly how to manage the car; and I feel sure that </p><p>you can navigate her home as well as I could my- </p><p>self.” </p><p> The idea of parting from Edmund, of leaving him</p><p>alone on this distant planet while we returned to the </p><p>earth, had never crossed my mind. Now, coming so </p><p>suddenly, it quite overwhelmed me. </p><p> I had long ago forgotten to feel the least resent-</p><p>ment because he had practically kidnapped us and </p><p>brought us way off here against our knowledge and </p><p>against our will. It seemed to me like desertion to </p><p>leave him, and I could not reconcile myself to the </p><p>thought. </p><p> I felt a lump rising in my throat; and it would</p><p>not surprise me if there were tears in my eyes. </p><p> “But, Edmund, I finally managed to say, “you</p><p>can’t stay, you know, and Ala can’t stay. The lives </p><p>of both of you will be sacrificed. Your enemies are </p><p>too numerous and too powerful.” </p><p> “No,” he replied cheerfully. “We shall run no</p><p>great danger. Ala believes that she can stem the </p><p>tide; and I believe it, too, for there never was an- </p><p>other such a woman! She proposes tftat we meet the </p><p>machinations of the chief priest with a counter- </p><p>stroke.” </p><p> “What sort of counterstroke can you deal?”</p><p> “You know how popular Ala has always been, and</p><p>you know also how charmed the whole population </p><p>was with the news of our romance. It is the in- </p><p>grained nature of these children of the sun. They </p><p>passionately love the romantic and the beautiful. </p><p> “We believe that we can overcome the opposition</p><p>of the superstitious element and rouse enthusiastic </p><p>devotion to ourselves, by publicly proclaiming our </p><p>betrothal, and celebrating our nuptials at the ear- </p><p>liest possible moment; and we are going to do it.” </p><p>I was struck dumb—the thing was so unexpected </p><p>and, to my mind, so preposterous. </p><p> “Why, Edmund,” I at last managed to say,”</p><p>“that’s the very thing to bring your enemies down </p><p>upon you. </p><p> “If you are determined to stay here on Venus, all</p><p>right. For Heaven’s sake don’t take a step so </p><p>openly defiant as that which you propose. Keep in </p><p>the background, and get Ala to try her arts of per- </p><p>suasion until the storm blows over.” </p><p> Nothing that I could urge moved him. He and</p><p>Ala had made up their minds, and that was the end </p><p>of it. </p><p> He wound up the discussion by asking me to go</p><p>at once to the car, in order that he might instruct </p><p>me in the management of the controllers. Ala, as </p><p>well as Jack, Henry, and Juba, accompanied us. </p><p> The mere knowledge of Ingra’s presence was</p><p>sufficient to make Edmund wish to have Ala con- </p><p>tinually under his eye; and the others followed where </p><p>they saw us going. The lesson was not long, for </p><p>already I had a general idea of the management of </p><p>the machinery; but it was rendered a little difficult </p><p>by the tacit understanding between Edmund and me </p><p>that Henry should not be told what was in the wind. </p><p> He would be glad enough to go home, but we were</p><p>sure that he would oppose any one acting as engineer </p><p>except Edmund. The affair was managed without </p><p>exciting Henry’s suspicions. Afterward, I got Jack </p><p>aside and toid him the whole story. </p><p> As I expected, he adopted Edmund’s view at</p><p>once. </p><p> “Just the thing to do,” he declared. “But, I tell</p><p>you what, I’m more than half disposed to stay here </p><p>myself, if Edmund does.” </p><p> “Do as you like, Jack,” I replied; “but I’m going</p><p>to get away just as soon as I am certain that Ed- </p><p>mund and Ala cannot, after all, be persuaded to go,</p><p>and that they are in no immediate danger.” </p><p> You are not to suppose, f»om what I have said,</p><p>that Ala was deserted by her people in the midst of </p><p>the serious trouble in which she and we had involved </p><p>ourselves. Her self-confidence, as exhibited in the </p><p>plan which she had formed with Edmund, was alone </p><p>a sufficient indication that she had plenty of friends </p><p>left, and that her rank and character still protected </p><p>her. </p><p>The Betrothal </p><p>AS soon, then, as she had informed these friends </p><p>and faithful supporters of her design, they loy- </p><p>ally aided her to put it into execution. At a less an- </p><p>xious moment I should have eagerly examined into </p><p>all the details of the singular ceremony by which </p><p>the betrothal of the queen to a stranger of another </p><p>race and from another world was to be proclaimed </p><p>to her people. As it was, my mind was too full, and </p><p>only the culminating scene was stamped on my </p><p>memory. </p><p> The immense palace-tower and hundreds of other</p><p>towers all over the city were decorated as we had </p><p>never seen them before. The display of color was </p><p>amazing, even after our experience. </p><p> Most beautiful of all, I thought, was the spectacle</p><p>presented by the thousands of airplanes and airships </p><p>in gala dress. They spiraled about, so countless and </p><p>so brilliant, so swift and so graceful in their mazy </p><p>circlings, that one seemed to be plunged into the </p><p>midst of a vast swarm of the most gorgeous butter- </p><p>flies. </p><p> So dazzling and fascinating a spectacle was never</p><p>conceived by the most ingenious inventor of carni- </p><p>vals and ballets. </p><p> But even while I stood admiring it I could not</p><p>drive away the thought that this wonderful display </p><p>was, in itself, simply a defiance to our enemies, the </p><p>waving of the toreador’s scarlet flag, and I shud- </p><p>dered at consequences which I could not foresee. </p><p> The hour for the final ceremony was now close at</p><p>hand, and we were all to take a conspicuous part in </p><p>it, standing with Ala and Edmund to receive the </p><p>congratulations of the people, after a priest, whom </p><p>C14 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>Ala had won over to her side, had publicly pro- </p><p>claimed their betrothal. </p><p> Ala, beautiful as I had never yet seen her, was</p><p>already habited in white garments glittering with </p><p>diamonds, and Edmund had been fitted out in appro- </p><p>priate dress which splendidly set off his magnificent </p><p>figure, with a jeweled fillet resting amid his dark </p><p>curls. </p><p>Preparing to Return to the Earth </p><p>WHILE we waited thus in one of the upper </p><p>apartments of the palace-tower an irresistible </p><p>impulse came to me to examine the car, which had </p><p>been removed to a neighboring tower. I do not </p><p>know why I suddenly felt this desire—it may have </p><p>been some suspicion of possible meddling by Ingra </p><p>—but, at any rate, I immediately yielded to it. </p><p> I had a key to the chamber in which the car was</p><p>locked, and I said to Edmund, who was in high </p><p>spirits: </p><p> “I want to run over to look at the car."</p><p> “All right," he replied, “but you must be back in</p><p>a quarter of an hour, without fail." </p><p> “I’ll be back,” I responded, and summoned an air-</p><p>boat waiting at the landing. </p><p> Jack and Henry at once expressed a desire to</p><p>accompany me, and I consented. We were not a </p><p>minute in crossing the space separating the palace </p><p>from the adjoining tower, and while Jack and Henry </p><p>remained on the landing of the latter, admiring the </p><p>scene before them, I approached the locked chamber </p><p>containing the car. As I put the key in the door I </p><p>asked myself: </p><p> “What am I here for? I’m hanged if I know.</p><p>But, anyhow, I’ll take a look." </p><p> I opened the door and entered. The car was ap-</p><p>parently all right, and, while I was looking it over </p><p>with no particular design, I heard Jack’s voice raised </p><p>in great excitement. </p><p> I ran to the door, and a gush of heat smote me</p><p>in the face. A single glance showed me that the </p><p>palace was in flames! Vast tongues of fire were </p><p>leaping up from its lower stories, licking the in- </p><p>numerable brilliant balconies, which burst into flame </p><p>as if they had been so much tinder.</p><p> Stunned for an instant by the awful sight, the</p><p>next moment I leaped into the air-boat, pushing </p><p>Jack and Henry before me, but even as we did this </p><p>the material of the boat caught fire, and its engineer </p><p>sprang back upon the platform of the tower. </p><p>“Quick!” I shouted. “We must get the car out. </p><p> We dashed into the apartment containing it, and</p><p>now the value of Edmund’s recent instructions was </p><p>shown. But for them I should never have been able </p><p>to manage it in such an emergency. </p><p> Madly we pushed it out into the furnace of heat,</p><p>for our own tower had caught fire, ind, as we </p><p>sprang inside, I turned on the power. \ve rose like </p><p>a shot out of the flame and smoke. </p><p> Immediately I swung round on the other side of</p><p>the palace opposite to that where we had been. Here, </p><p>as I hoped, the flames had not yet mounted to the </p><p>level that they had attained on the other side. But </p><p>a sight met my eyes that, for a moment, drove me </p><p>mad with rage. </p><p>The Conflagration </p><p>THERE, with a single steersman in an air-boat, </p><p>was Ingra, torch in hand, spreading the con- </p><p>flagration ! Forgetting in my fury what I had come </p><p>for, I drove the car straight against him. He turned </p><p>with startled eyes, and saw us bearing down upon </p><p>him. He read death in my face, and his own grew </p><p>pale. </p><p> Desperately he endeavored to evade the encounter,</p><p>but the steel car struck his boat like a ram, crushed </p><p>in its side, and sent Ingra and his unfortunate com- </p><p>panion spinning into the flames below. </p><p> I exulted over the deed! I felt an unholy joy in</p><p>having at last wrought vengeance upon this monster. </p><p> Then the thought of the time I had lost flashed</p><p>upon me like an accusation. </p><p> “In Heaven’s name!” I cried. “We must save</p><p>Edmund and Ala!” </p><p> “And Juba!” shouted Jack.</p><p>I turned the car, and sped for the platform on </p><p>which I knew that they must be. </p><p> We saw them! But—Heaven forgive me!—w€</p><p>were too late! </p><p> My vengeance had been purchased at an awful</p><p>price. A minute earlier we might have saved them, </p><p>but now they were in the midst of the flames. Ed- </p><p>mund had Ala in his arms, and Juba, his long hair </p><p>catching the sparks, stood resolutely beside them. </p><p> Edmund saw me, and, as I live, he smiled. He</p><p>opened his lips, but in the awful roar of the fire I </p><p>could not hear his voice. </p><p> Then he raised his hand, and seemed to be waving</p><p>us off. He pointed upward, as if commanding us to </p><p>go. </p><p> “I’ll save them yet!” I yelled between my set</p><p>teeth, and rushed the car into the flames. </p><p> But at this instant the whole vast structure of the</p><p>tower gave way. </p><p> It crumbled like a pile of ashes, and they were</p><p>gone, </p><p>CHAPTER XXIV. </p><p>The Earth </p><p>FOR a few minutes after this terrible consum- </p><p>mation none of us spoke a word. Henry had </p><p>swooned. Jack stood motionless by my side. </p><p> Where the tower had been, and the leaping flames</p><p>had raged, was a vast vacuity, with wreathes of </p><p>smoke rising from far below. </p><p> The conflagration was now spreading all over the</p><p>splendid city. A hundred towers were burning </p><p>fiercely on all sides, the pointed flames licking the </p><p>sky, and thousands of planes and air-ships that had </p><p>also caught fire were dropping like flaming brands </p><p>into the furnace. </p><p> The sight filled me at once with pity and with</p><p>horror. I saw one large plane, filled with people, </p><p>driven, in spite of the exertions of its engineers, </p><p>directly over a burning tower. A long spire of </p><p>flame reached up and touched it. It seemed to </p><p>shrivel like a moth in a candle, and down it went </p><p>with all its living freight. </p><p> “Get away from here!” cried Jack, at last recover-</p><p>ing his voice. </p><p> I turned the car and we sped away.</p><p>For hours we rushed on, not particular to choose </p><p>A COLUMBUS OF SPACE </p><p>615 </p><p>our direction. Our only thought was to escape from </p><p>this dreadful place. At last I slowed down to take </p><p>our bearings. </p><p> We had left the doomed capital behind the hori-</p><p>zon, and only the well-known expanse of land be- </p><p>neath, with a few airplanes sailing about over it, </p><p>and the cloud-dome above our heads, reminded us </p><p>that we were still on the planet Venus. </p><p>Back to Earth </p><p>1 BROUGHT the car to rest and sat down with </p><p>Jack to consult. We looked at each other for a </p><p>time in silence. Then we both burst into tears. </p><p> When we recovered ourselves we got out some</p><p>provisions and set the little table on which Edmund </p><p>had served our first morning meal after leaving the </p><p>earth. We were ravenous with hunger, but it was </p><p>a sad repast. </p><p> Henry had to be forced to eat a few mouthfuls,</p><p>for he was yet out of his head and kept up his </p><p>strange mutterings. When the meal was finished </p><p>Jack and I decided upon our course. </p><p> “There is no reason for staying here another</p><p>hour,” I said. “We must start at once for the </p><p>earth.” </p><p> “But are you sure that you can manage the car</p><p>in open space?” Jack eagerly inquired. </p><p>“Yes; Edmund told me everything that needs to </p><p>be done,” and my eyes filled with tears as I spoke. </p><p> “Then let us go,” said Jack solemnly.</p><p> We rose swiftly through the cloud-dome, and</p><p>once more the magnificent spectacle of the great </p><p>white globe was before us. As rapidly as possible </p><p>I accelerated the speed of the car, and the huge </p><p>planet seemed to sail away into space. </p><p> Once above the atmosphere the heavens turned</p><p>black and the stars sprang out to view. There was </p><p>the earth again shining brilliantly, with the moon </p><p>close at her side, and I set our course for them. </p><p> After a while the indicator showed a speed of</p><p>twenty miles a second. </p><p> “I hardly dare to work it up higher,” I said, “but</p><p>since Venus and the earth are now again in conjunc-</p><p>tion, the distance we have to travel is only about </p><p>twenty-six million miles, and we can make it in a </p><p>little over eleven and a half days.” </p><p> “And the meteors?” suggested Jack.</p><p> “We shall have to trust to luck,” I replied.</p><p> Oh, what a trip that was 1</p><p> Our hearts were filled with sadness, for, upon my</p><p>word, we thought more of Edmund and Ala and </p><p>Juba than of the home to which we were returning. </p><p> Henry added to our trouble, for his mind became</p><p>every hour more clouded. At length he grew vio- </p><p>lent in his insanity, and sometimes we were obliged </p><p>to use force to prevent him from injuring himself. </p><p> We had arrived, according to my calculations,</p><p>within a quarter of a million miles of the earth, and </p><p>already we could begin to see many of its geographi- </p><p>cal features, when a crisis arose in Henry’s case. </p><p> He had been quiet for a long time, and we had</p><p>ceased to watch him as carefully as we should have </p><p>done, when, quite unexpectedly, he was seized with </p><p>a maniacal fit, and before a hand could be laid upon </p><p>him he had thrown open one of the windows and pre- </p><p>cipitated himself out of it. </p><p>The First Death </p><p>HE leaped with such force that he shot several </p><p>yards away from the car. I realized in a flash </p><p>that he had gone to his death, for we could not re- </p><p>cover him before his bi-eath would be exhausted. It </p><p>was necessary instantly to close the window, because </p><p>the air was rushing out, and in a few seconds it </p><p>would be all gone, and we could not replace it. The </p><p>apparatus which Edmund had provided automati- </p><p>cally purified the air in the car, and rendered it fit </p><p>to be breathed over and over again for an indefinite </p><p>time, but there was no means of making more air. </p><p> Already in the few seconds that the window had</p><p>remained open the larger part of our supply of air </p><p>had escaped, and the moment we had slammed the </p><p>window back into its air-tight settings Jack and I </p><p>gasped and sank almost helpless on the floor. </p><p> For several minutes we were unable to rise. At</p><p>last I struggled to my feet and looked out of the </p><p>window. </p><p> There floated Henry’s body, accompanying us in</p><p>our flight! </p><p>“Oh, Jack!” I said faintly. “I cannot bear this!” </p><p> “What is it?” he managed to whisper, painfully</p><p>lifting himself to the window. </p><p> The instant he looked out he dropped back to the</p><p>floor with a groan. </p><p> The thought of Henry following us was too hor-</p><p>rible to be entertained. Desperately I turned a </p><p>guiding wheel, and the car moved away on a dif- </p><p>ferent course. But with fascinated eyes I centinued </p><p>to watch the body of our friend until, a mere speck, </p><p>it faded into the blackness of the sky. </p><p> Poor Henry! He had chosen a strange tomb, as</p><p>deep as the heavens and as lasting. I shuddered at </p><p>the thought that there he would continue to float </p><p>forever, imperishable in germless space, unless, per- </p><p>haps, his mother earth should draw him at last </p><p>to her bosom, when, flashing for an instant with </p><p>meteoric fire, his ashes would be scattered unper- </p><p>ceived through the wide atmosphere. </p><p> The desperation of the situation in which I now</p><p>found myself it is impossible to put into words. </p><p>Jack, whose stoutness doubtless served to diminish </p><p>his breathing capacity, continued lying on the floor, </p><p>gasping and half asphyxiated. I myself was as weak </p><p>as a child, yet I had to guide the car. </p><p>The End of Jack </p><p>WITHOUT thought of anything but the neces- </p><p>sity of reaching the earth, or at least of get- </p><p>ting within the limits of the atmosphere, at the ear- </p><p>liest possible moment, I recklessly increased the </p><p>speed. A few minutes’ time saved might mean life </p><p>for Jack. When I spoke to him he could not reply, </p><p>but I saw that he was still breathing. </p><p> How that car did spin!</p><p> Before I was aware that we were so near I sud-</p><p>denly perceived a vast dark mass filling all the sky </p><p>that was visible from the window. The earth! At </p><p>last we were almost there. We must be at the </p><p>upper limit of the atmosphere, and I dared not con- </p><p>tinue this speed any longer. </p><p>I slowed down as rapidly as I could, and not a </p><p>minute too soon, for I could feel heat coming </p><p>through the walls of the car, and at the same mo- </p><p>ment the stout glass in one of the windows cracked </p><p>{.Continued on -page 669) </p><p>^Purchase ofmeWm Foie </p><p>Tho noise was truly, awful.

There is the usual share-holders’ meeting </p><p>and everything seems in a fair way to progress in </p><p>great triumph. But a lightning stroke upsets the </p><p>mathematical calculations. </p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE </p><p> By JULES VERNE</p><p> Part II</p><p>What Causes The Seasons? </p><p> In the first place, during the diurnal rotation of</p><p>Jupiter, which occupies nine hours, fifty-five min- </p><p>ute^, the days are always equal to the nights in all </p><p>latitudes; that is to say, the Jovian day is four </p><p>hours, fifty-seven minutes long, and the Jovian night </p><p>lasts also four hours and fifty-seven minutes. </p><p> “There,” said the admirers of Jovian existence,</p><p>“you have something suited to people of regular </p><p>haHts. They will be delighted to submit to such </p><p>regularity.” </p><p> That is what would happen to the Earth if Bar-</p><p>bicane did what he promised, only as the new axis </p><p>would make no difference in the time of rotation, </p><p>twenty-four hours would still separate the success- </p><p>ive noons, and our spheroid would be blessed with </p><p>nights, and days each twelve hours long, and we </p><p>would live in a perpetual equinox. </p><p> “But the climatal phenomena would be much more</p><p>curious; and no less interesting,” said the enthusi- </p><p>asts, “would be the absence of the seasons.” </p><p> Owing to the inclina-</p><p>tion of the axis to the </p><p>plane of the orbit, we have </p><p>the annual changes known </p><p>as spring, summer, au- </p><p>tumn, and winter. The </p><p>Jovians could know noth- </p><p>ing of these things, and </p><p>the Terrestrians would </p><p>know them no more. The </p><p>moment the new axis be-</p><p>came pecpcndicular to the </p><p>ecliptic there would be </p><p>neither frigid zones nor </p><p>torrid zones, but the </p><p>whole Earth would rejoice </p><p>in a temperate climate. </p><p> Why was this?</p><p> What is the Torrid</p><p>zone? It is that part of the Earth comprised between </p><p>the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Every place </p><p>within this zone has the Sun in the zenith twice a </p><p>year. </p><p> What are the Temperate zones? The part com-</p><p>prised between the Tropics and the Polar circles; </p><p>between 23° 28' and 66° 32' of latitude, and in which </p><p>the Sun never rises to the zenith, but is above the </p><p>horizon on every day in the year. </p><p> What are the Frigid zones? That part of the cir-</p><p>cum-polar regions in which the Sun does not rise </p><p>abtve the horizon on every day in the year; while </p><p>at the Pole itself he does not rise for six months at a </p><p>time. </p><p> The height of the Sun above the horizon is the</p><p>cause of the excessive heat of the Torrid zone, the </p><p>moderate heat of the Temperate zone and the exces- </p><p>sive cold within the Polar circles. </p><p> When the axis became perpendicular these things</p><p>would be different. The Sun would remain on the </p><p>plane of the Equator. All the year around he would </p><p>pursue his imperturbable twelve-hour course, and </p><p>rise to a distance from the zenith according to the </p><p>latitude of the place. In countries of twenty de- </p><p>grees of latitude he would rise seventy degrees </p><p>above the horizon; in countries of forty-nine de- </p><p>grees of latitude he would rise forty-one; in places </p><p>of eighty-four degrees he would rise six, and of </p><p>ninety degrees (the Pole), he would just peep half </p><p>his diameter above the horizon. The days would be </p><p>perfectly regular, and the Sun would rise at the </p><p>same time, and also at the same point on the horizon, </p><p>throughout the year. </p><p> “Look at the advan-</p><p>tages!” said the friends </p><p>of Barbicane. “Every </p><p>man, according to his </p><p>temperament, can choose </p><p>his own climate, which </p><p>will be invariable!” </p><p>Those modern Titans, </p><p>the North Pole Practical</p><p>Association, were going to </p><p>effect a complete change </p><p>in the state of things </p><p>which had existed ever </p><p>since the spheroid had </p><p>been launched on its orbit </p><p>to become the Earth as we </p><p>know it. </p><p> The astronomer might</p><p>lose a few of the familiar </p><p>constellations; the poet might lose the long winter </p><p>nights and the long summer days that figure so fre- </p><p>quently in modern verse; but what of that when we </p><p>think of the advantages that would be enjoyed by </p><p>the majority of the human race? </p><p> As the newspapers in the Barbicane interest</p><p>pointed out, the products of the Earth being reduced </p><p>to regularity, the farmer could always plant and </p><p>sow in the most favorable temperature. </p><p> “Be it so!” said the opposition. “But are we to</p><p>have no rains, or hail, or storms, or waterspouts, or </p><p> IN the second and final installment we find our favorite</p><p> author continuing this classic tale in a lighter vein.</p><p> Is it possible for the earth’s axis to be changed by any</p><p> human agency?

The Earth would continue to describe its orbit </p><p>through space, and the conditions of the solar year </p><p>would remain the same. </p><p> When the consequences of the change of axis</p><p>were brought to the knowledge of the world, they </p><p>caused extraordinary excitement. At first this prob- </p><p>lem of the higher mechanics received an enthusiastic </p><p>welcome. The idea of having seasons of constant </p><p>equality, and, according to the latitude, “to suit </p><p>consumers,” was very attractive. The crowd re- </p><p>veled in the thought that they could enjoy the per- </p><p>petual spring which the bard of Telemachus accord- </p><p>ed to the Island of Calypso, and that they could have </p><p>the spring either fresh or mild. Where the new axis </p><p>was to be seemed to be the secret of Barbicane, </p><p>Nicholl, and J. T. Maston, which they were in no </p><p>hurry to present to the public. Would they reveal it</p><p>in advance, or would it be known after the experi- </p><p>ment? It would be as well to say so, perhaps, as </p><p>opinion began to show signs of anxiety in the mat- </p><p>ter.	.</p><p> One observation ocurred naturally to the mind,</p><p>and was at once commented on in the newspapers. </p><p>By what mechanical means was the change to be </p><p>produced, which evidently required the employment </p><p>of an enormous force? </p><p> The Forum, an important New York review, very</p><p>justly remarked: “If the Earth did not turn on its </p><p>axis, it is probable that a relatively feeble shock </p><p>would suffice to give a movement of rotation around </p><p>an axis arbitrarily chosen; but the Earth is like an </p><p>enormous gyroscope moving at high velocity, and </p><p>it is a natural law that such an apparatus has a </p><p>tendency to turn around the same axis, as Foucault </p><p>demonstrated in his well-known experiments. It </p><p>will therefore be very difficult, if not impossible, to </p><p>shift it.’1 </p><p> But after asking what would be the effort re-</p><p>quired by the engineers of the North Polar Practi- </p><p>cal Association, it was at least as interesting to </p><p>know if the effort was to be suddenly or insensibly </p><p>applied. And if it was to be a sudden effort, would </p><p>not the proceedings of Messrs. Barbicane &amp; Co. pro- </p><p>duce some rather alarming catastrophies on the face </p><p>of the Earth? </p><p>A New Character Appears </p><p>HERE was something to occupy the brains of the </p><p>wise and foolish. A shock is a shock, and it is </p><p>never agreeable to receive the blow or the counter- </p><p>blow. There was a likelihood that the promoters of </p><p>the enterprise had been so busy with the advantages </p><p>the world was to possess that they had overlooked </p><p>the destruction the operation would entail. And </p><p>with considerable cleverness the Major and his allies </p><p>made the most of this, and began to agitate public </p><p>opinion against the president of the Gun Club. </p><p> Although France had taken bo part in the syndi-</p><p>cating, and officially treated the matter with disdain, </p><p>yet there was in that country an individual who con- </p><p>ceived the idea of setting out for Baltimore, to fol- </p><p>low, for his own private satisfaction, the different </p><p>phases of the enterprise. </p><p> He was a mining engineer of about five and thirty</p><p>year of age. He had been the first on the list when </p><p>admitted to the Polytechnic School, and he had been </p><p>the first on the list when he left it, so that he must </p><p>have been a mathematician of the first order, and</p><p>probably superior to J. T. Maston, who, though he </p><p>was a long way above the average, was only a cal- </p><p>culator after all—that is to say, what Leverrier was </p><p>compared to Newton or Laplace. </p><p> This engineer was a man of brains, and—though</p><p>he was none the worse for that—somewhat of a </p><p>humorist, and an original. In conversation with his </p><p>intimates, even when he talked science, his language </p><p>was more that of the slang of the streets than of the </p><p>academical formulas he employed when he wrote. He </p><p>was a wonderful worker, being accustomed to sit </p><p>for ten hours at a stretch before his table, writing </p><p>pages on pages of algebra with as much ease as he </p><p>would have written a letter. </p><p> This singular man was called Pierdeux (Alcide),</p><p>and in his way of condensing it—as is the custom </p><p>of his comrades—he generally signed himself </p><p>APierd, or even AP 1, without even dotting the i. </p><p>He was so perfervid in his discussions that he had </p><p>been named Vitriolic Alcide. Not only was he big, </p><p>but he was tall. His friends affirmed that his height </p><p>was exactly the five millionth part of a quarter of </p><p>the meridian, and they were not far out. Although </p><p>bis head was rather too small for his powerful bust </p><p>and shoulders, yet he held it well, and piercing were </p><p>the eyes that looked through his pince-nez. He was </p><p>chiefly distiguished by one of those physiognomies </p><p>in which gaiety and gravity intermingle, and his </p><p>hair had been prematurely thinned by the abuse of </p><p>algebraic signs under the light of the gas-lamps in </p><p>the study. </p><p> He was one of the best fellows whose memory</p><p>lingers at the school. Although his character was </p><p>independent enough, he was always loyal to the re- </p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE </p><p>619 </p><p>quirements of Code X, which is law among the Poly- </p><p>technicians in all that concerns comradeship and re- </p><p>spect for the uniform. He was equally appreciated </p><p>under the trees of the court of “Acas,” so named </p><p>because there are no acacias, as in the “casers,” the </p><p>dormitories, in which the arrangements of his box, </p><p>and the order that reigned in his “coffin,” denoted </p><p>an absolutely methodical mind. </p><p> That the head of Alcide Pierdeux was a little too</p><p>small for his body we admit, but that it was filled to </p><p>the meninges will be believed. Above all things, he </p><p>was a mathematician as all his comrades are, or </p><p>have been, but he only used his mathematics in ap- </p><p>plication to experimental science, whose chief at- </p><p>traction to him was that it had much to do with in- </p><p>dustry. Herein he recognized the inferior side of </p><p>his nature. No one is perfect. His strong point was </p><p>the study of those sciences which, notwithstanding </p><p>their immense progress, have, and always will have, </p><p>secrets for their followers. </p><p> Alcide was still a bachelor. He was still “equal</p><p>to one,” as he phrased it, although he had no ob- </p><p>jection to become “the half of two.” His friends had </p><p>had ideas of marrying him to a very charming girl </p><p>at Martigues. But, unfortunately, she had a father, </p><p>who responded to the first overtures in the follow- </p><p>ing “martigalade”: “No, your Alcide is too clever! </p><p>He talks to my poor girl in a way that is unintell- </p><p>igible to her!” </p><p> And hence Alcide resolved to take a year’s holiday,</p><p>and thought he could not employ his time better than </p><p>in following the North Polar Practical Association </p><p>in its peculiar undertaking. </p><p> As soon as he arrived at Baltimore he began to</p><p>think over the matter seriously. That the Earth </p><p>would become Jovian by the change of its axis mat- </p><p>tered very little to him. But by what means it was </p><p>to be brought about excited his curiosity, and not </p><p>without reason. </p><p>A Frenchman in Baltimore </p><p>IN his picturesque language he said to himself, </p><p>Evidently Barbicane is going to give our ball a </p><p>terrible knock; but what sort of a knock? Every- </p><p>thing depends on that! I suppose he is going to play </p><p>for ‘side,’ as if with a cue at a billiard-ball; but if he </p><p>hits us ‘square’ he may jolt us out of our orbit, and </p><p>then the years will dance to a pretty tune. They are </p><p>going to shift the old axis for a new one, probably </p><p>above it, but I do not see where they are to get their</p><p>taking-off place from, or how they are to manage the </p><p>knock. If there was no rotation, a mere flip would </p><p>suffice, but they can’t put down that diurnal spin. </p><p>That is the canisdentum.” </p><p> He meant “the rub,” but that was his way of ex-</p><p>pressing himself. </p><p> “Whatever they do,” he continued, “there will be</p><p>no end of a row before it is over.” </p><p> Try all he could, the engineer could not discover</p><p>Barbicane’s plan, which for one reason was much to </p><p>be regretted, as if it had been known to him he would </p><p>at once have made the calculations he needed. </p><p> But all at present was a mystery. And so it hap-</p><p>pened that on the 29th of December Alcide Pierdeux, </p><p>Ingtnieur au Corps National des Mines de France," </p><p>was hurrying with lengthy strides through the </p><p>crowded streets of Baltimore. </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>A Change in Public Opinion </p><p>A MONTH had elapsed since the meeting in </p><p>rooms of the Gun Club, and a change had </p><p>taken place in public opinion. </p><p> The advantages of altering the axis of rotation</p><p>were being forgotten; and the disadvantages were </p><p>being enlarged upon. It was impossible that a </p><p>catastrophe could be avoided, for any change must </p><p>necessarily be occasioned by a violent shock. What </p><p>the catastrophe would be no one could say. Was </p><p>this amelioration of climate desirable? Who would </p><p>gain by it except the Eskimos, Laps, and Samoyeds, </p><p>who had nothing to lose? </p><p> The Major and his allies were indefatigable in</p><p>their prophecies of evil. </p><p> “It is evident,” said Karkof, “that the projectors</p><p>will do all they can to protect the United States from </p><p>the consequences of tho shock.” </p><p> “But can they?” asked Harald. “When you shake</p><p>a tree all the branches shake.” </p><p> “And,” said the Dutchman, “when you are hit in</p><p>the stomach does not your whole body shake?” </p><p>“That is what that famous clause meant!” said </p><p>Todrin. “Here are the geographical and meteoro- </p><p>logical modifications!” </p><p> “Yes,” said Baldenak. “But suppose the change of</p><p>axis throws the seas out of their existing basins?” </p><p>“And if the ocean level is lowered at different</p><p>points,” said Jansen, “some people may find them- </p><p>selves so high up in the world that communication </p><p>with them will be impossible!” </p><p> “If they go up too high they will not be able to</p><p>breathe!” said Harald. </p><p> “Would you like to see Baltimore as high as</p><p>Mont Blanc?” asked Donellan. </p><p> This modification of the axis was evidently a pub-</p><p>lic danger. A change of 23° 28' would produce a </p><p>considerable displacement in the seas, owing to the </p><p>flattening at the Poles. The Earth was thus threat- </p><p>ened with similar disasters to those that, it is be- </p><p>lieved, have recently occurred in Mars. There en- </p><p>tire continents, among others Libya and Schia- </p><p>parelli, have been submerged, as shown by the </p><p>faint blue replacing the faint red. Lake Moeris has </p><p>disappeared. North and south there have been </p><p>changes, and the oceans have withdrawn from many </p><p>localties they formerly occupied. If a few charita- </p><p>ble souls have been much affected at the “floods in </p><p>Mars”—almost as much as to open subscriptions for </p><p>the sufferers—what would they do for the floods </p><p>on the Earth? </p><p> Protests came in by every post. The United</p><p>States Government was urged to interfere. </p><p> “Look as these Yankees,” said one. “They want</p><p>to hang the globe on another axletree! As if the </p><p>old one, after all these centuries, had worn out! </p><p>But is it not as sound as it was at the beginning?” </p><p>And there was Vitriolic Alcide at work trying to </p><p>find out the nature and direction of the shock that </p><p>J. T. Maston had arranged. Once master of the </p><p>secret, he would very soon know what parts of the </p><p>Earth were in danger. </p><p>The Contents of the Note-Book </p><p>IT was not likely that the United States would </p><p>suffer. Barbicane &amp; Co. were quite Yankees </p><p>620 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>enough to take care of their own country. Evidently </p><p>the new Continent between the Arctic Sea and the </p><p>Gulf of Mexico had nothing to fear. It was even </p><p>possible that North America would gain a con- </p><p>siderable accession of territory. </p><p> “That may be,” said the nervous people who only</p><p>saw the perilous side of things. “But are you </p><p>sure? Supposing J. T. Maston has made a mistake? </p><p>Supposing Barbicane makes a mistake when he puts </p><p>Maston’s theory in practice? Such a thing can </p><p>happen to the cleverest artillerists! They do not </p><p>always score, a bull’s-eye!” </p><p> These fears were sedulously worked upon by the</p><p>Major and the opposition. Todrin published a num- </p><p>ber of articles in a leading Canadian newspaper. </p><p>Harald rushed into print in a Swedish journal. </p><p>Colonel Boris Karkof tried his hand in a Russian </p><p>one. The Americans began to take sides. The New </p><p>York Tribune and the Boston Journal took up their </p><p>parable against Barbicane. In vain the North Po- </p><p>lar Practical Association tried to stem the rising </p><p>tide. In vain Mrs. Scorbitt paid ten dollars a line </p><p>for serious articles, humorous articles, and smart, </p><p>scathing paragraphs treating the dangers as chimer- </p><p>ical. In vain the enthusiastic widow endeavored to </p><p>show that if ever hypothesis was unjustifiable, it </p><p>was that which assumed that J. T. Maston was </p><p>capable of an error! </p><p> Neither Barbicane nor his co-directors took the</p><p>trouble to say anything. They let the talk go on </p><p>without making any change in their habits. They </p><p>seemed to be thoroughly absorbed in the immense </p><p>preparations necessitated by their undertaking. The </p><p>revulsion of public opinion seemed to concern them </p><p>not in the least. </p><p> But in spite of all Mrs. Scorbitt could do, it soon</p><p>came about that Impey Barbicane, Captain Nicholl, </p><p>and J. T. Maston began to be looked upon as dan- </p><p>gers to society. So high grew the clamor that the </p><p>Federal Government had to interfere, and call upon </p><p>them to declare their intentions. What were their </p><p>means of action? How did they intend to substitute </p><p>one axis for another? What would be the conse- </p><p>quences of the substitution? What parts of the </p><p>globe would the substitution endanger? </p><p> The excitement raging in every State in the</p><p>Union allowed of no hesitation on the part of the </p><p>Washington Government. A Commission of In- </p><p>quiry, composed of engineers, mathematicians, hy- </p><p>drographers, and geographers, to the number of</p><p>fifty, presided over by the celebrated John Prestice, </p><p>was appointed on the 19th of February, with full </p><p>power to investigate the affair, and put a stop to it </p><p>if necessary. </p><p> Impey Barbicane was requested to attend before</p><p>the commission, Barbicane did not come. </p><p> The police went to look for him at his residence,</p><p>95 Cleveland Street, Baltimore. Barbicane was </p><p>there no longer. </p><p> Where was he? They did not know.</p><p> When had he gone away? Five weeks ago, on</p><p>the 11th of January, he had left Maryland in com- </p><p>pany with Captain Nicholl. </p><p> Where had they gone? No one could say.</p><p> Evidently the two members of the Gun Club</p><p>were on their way to the mysterious region where </p><p>preparations would begin under their direction. </p><p> But where could that be?</p><p> It was important to know, if the scheme of</p><p>these dangerous projectors was to be nipped in the </p><p>bud. </p><p> The effect of this departure of Barbicane and</p><p>Nicholl was immense. The popular wrath rose like </p><p>the rising of the equinoctial tide against the North </p><p>Polar Practical Association. </p><p> But there was one man who ought to know what</p><p>had become of Barbicane and his colleague. There </p><p>was one who ought to be able to reply, and instantly, </p><p>J. T. Maston! </p><p> J. T. Maston was requested to appear before the</p><p> Commission. He did not go!</p><p> Hed he then left Baltimore? Had he gone with his</p><p> colleagues, to help in the work of which the world</p><p> awaited the results with such very natural alarm?</p><p> No! J. T. Maston was still to be found at Ballis-</p><p> tic Cottage. He was still incessantly at work, but</p><p> now on other calculations, which he only left to</p><p> spend an occasional evening with Mrs. Scorbitt at</p><p> New Park.</p><p> A policeman was sent with an order from the</p><p>president of the Commission. The policeman </p><p>reached the cottage, knocked at the door, entered </p><p>the hall, and had a warm reception from Fire-Fire </p><p>and a cool one from J. T. Maston.</p><p> However, the secretary of the Gun Club thought</p><p>it as well to go quietly, and he appeared before the </p><p>Commission complaining bitterly of having been </p><p>interrupted in his occupation. </p><p> The first question put to him was, “Do you know</p><p> the whereabouts of Impey Barbicane and Captain</p><p> Nicholl?”</p><p> “I do,” said J. T. Maston, “but I am not au-</p><p>thorized to tell you.” </p><p> Second question: “Are these two men occupied in</p><p> the preparations for their intended modification of</p><p> the terrestrial axis?”</p><p> “That,” said J. T. Maston, “is part of the secret</p><p> with which I am entrusted, and I refuse to say.”</p><p> “Would he submit his calculations to the Commis-</p><p> sion, that they might judge if the project of the</p><p> Association could be accomplished?”</p><p> “No, certainly not!” said J. T. Maston. “It is</p><p>my right as a free American citizen to keep from </p><p>anybody the result of my work!” </p><p> “But if that is your right, Mr. Maston,” said</p><p>President Prestice solemnly, as if he spoke in the </p><p>name of the entire world, “it may be your duty </p><p>to speak in face of the anxiety that exists.” </p><p>Heroic Silence </p><p>JT. MASTON did not think it was his duty. He </p><p>•	had only one duty—to keep silent; and he</p><p>would keep silent. </p><p> In spite of their persistence, their supplications,</p><p> their threats, the members of the Commission of</p><p> Inquiry could get nothing out of the man with the</p><p> iron hook. Never would they have believed that so</p><p> much obstinacy lurked within a gutta-percha cran-</p><p> ium! J. T. Maston left as he had arrived, and that</p><p> he was congratulated on his valiant defense by Mrs.</p><p> Scorbitt we need hardly say.</p><p> When the result of J. T. Maston’s appearance was</p><p> made known, public opinion took a form that was</p><p> jeally serious for his safety. The pressure on the</p><p> Government became so great that Secretary John S.</p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE </p><p>621 </p><p>Wright had to obtain permission from the President </p><p>to act maim militari. </p><p> On the evening of the 13th of March, J. T. Mas-</p><p>ton was in his workroom at Ballistic Cottage, ab- </p><p>sorbed in his algebra, when the bell of the telephone </p><p>tinkled nervously. </p><p> “Hallo, there! Hallo, there!” murmured the in-</p><p>strument in a way that showed great anxiety. </p><p> "Who’s there?” asked J. T. Maston.</p><p> “Mrs. Scorbitt.”</p><p> "What is it?”</p><p> “Be on your guard! I have just heard that this</p><p>very night—” </p><p> The sentence had not been finished when the door</p><p>of Ballistic Cottage was burst open by a push from </p><p>several shoulders, and up the staircase came an ex- </p><p>traordinary tumult. There was a voice protesting; </p><p>then other voices silencing it; then a bump as of a </p><p>fallen body—bump, bump—it was the negro, Fire- </p><p>Fire, rolling downstairs after an unavailing de- </p><p>fense of his master’s home—bump, bump; the door </p><p>of the workroom flew open; policemen rushed in; the </p><p>excitable Maston seized a revolver; instantly he </p><p>was disarmed; a policeman laid his hand on the </p><p>papers on the desk; Maston slipped free and dashed </p><p>at a note-book; the police were after him; before </p><p>they could reach him he had torn out the last leaf, </p><p>clipped it to his mouth, and gulped it down as if it </p><p>had been a pill! </p><p> “Now!” said he in the tone of a Leonidas at Ther-</p><p>mopylse, “Now you can do your duty.” </p><p> An hour afterward he was in the jail at Balti-</p><p>more. </p><p> And that was probably the best thing that could</p><p>have happened to him, for the populace were in such </p><p>a state of excitement that the police might have </p><p>found themselves powerless to protect him. </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>The Contents of the Notebook </p><p>THE book seized by the Baltimore police con- </p><p>tained thirty pages, sprinkled with formulse, </p><p>multiplications, equations, and finally the gen-</p><p>eral results of J. T. Maston’s calculation. It was </p><p>a work of the higher mechanics, appreciable only by </p><p>mathematicians. One of the equations was the— </p><p>of which we heard in the Moon Voyage. </p><p> The "general reader” could make neither head</p><p>nor tail of Maston’s performances; but they could </p><p>understand the results as told to the newspapers a </p><p>few days later. </p><p> There was nothing wrong with J. T. Maston’s</p><p>working, the Commission reported. The calcula- </p><p>tions had been made with such precision that the </p><p>Commission had no doubt as to their accuracy and </p><p>consequences. If the operation was effected, the ter- </p><p>restrial axis would be undoubtedly changed, and </p><p>then the catastrophes foreseen would be accom- </p><p>plished in all their plentitude. </p><p> “The object,” said the official communication to</p><p>the newspapers, “of the directorate of the North </p><p>Polar Practical Association is the substitution of si </p><p>new axis of rotation for the old one; and it is pro- </p><p>posed to attain this object by means of the recoil </p><p>of an apparatus fixed in some agreed point of the </p><p>Earth’s circumference. If the core of this appa- </p><p>ratus is firmly fixed in the ground, there can be no </p><p>doubt but that it would communicate its recoil to </p><p>the mass of our planet. </p><p> “The apparatus adopted by the Association is a</p><p>monster cannon, which would have no effect if dis- </p><p>charged vertically. To produce the maximum effect </p><p>it must be aimed horizontally toward the north or </p><p>south, and it is this latter direction which has been </p><p>decided on by the Association. In this way the re- </p><p>coil will produce a shock toward the north of the </p><p>nature of that given to a billiard-ball when struck </p><p>on the side.” </p><p> Exactly as Alcide had foreseen!</p><p> “As soon as the explosion takes place, the center</p><p>of the Earth will be displaced in a direction parallel </p><p>to that of the impetus, and a change will ensue in </p><p>the plane of the orbit, and consequently in the length </p><p>of the year; but this will be so slight as to be of </p><p>no appreciable amount. At the same time the Earth </p><p>would take a movement of rotation around an axis, </p><p>supposing that no rotation existed previous to the </p><p>shock. But as the rotation in the line of the Poles </p><p>already exists, it will combine with the accessory ro- </p><p>tation produced by the recoil, and result in a new </p><p>axis. If the gun is fired at the moment when the </p><p>Equator and the Ecliptic are in intersection, and </p><p>if the recoil is enough to displace the Pole 23° 28',</p><p>then the new axis will become perpendicular to the </p><p>plane of the orbit. </p><p> “The consequences of this perpendicularity were</p><p>clearly stated by Impey Barbicane at the meeting </p><p>on the 22nd of December. </p><p> “Given the mass of the Earth and the amount of</p><p>movement it possesses, can a gun be produced hav- </p><p>ing a recoil sufficient to produce such a displace- </p><p>ment of the Pole as 23° 28'? </p><p> “Undoubtedly; if a gun, or series of guns, be con-</p><p>structed in accordance with the laws of mechanics, </p><p>or if the inventors possess an explosive of the neces- </p><p>sary power. Such an explosive they unfortunately </p><p>possess. It was discovered by Captain Nicholl. Its </p><p>name is meli-melonite, but all that is known of it is </p><p>that it is a mixture of organic substances with ni- </p><p>tric acid. A certain number of monatomic radicals </p><p>are substituted for the same number of atoms of </p><p>hydrogen, and a powder is obtained, which, like gun- </p><p>cotton, is formed by combination, not by me- </p><p>chanical mixture of the principal comburents and </p><p>combustibles. </p><p>A Truly Epic Reply </p><p>utttHATEVER this explosive may be, the force </p><p> VV it possesses is sufficient to carry a projectile</p><p>weighing 180,000 tons beyond the terrestrial attrac- </p><p>tion, and it is hoped by the Association that the re- </p><p>coil will have the effect of displacing the Pole, and </p><p>forming a new axis perpendicular to the plane of </p><p>the ecliptic. From which would result the catas- </p><p>trophes which have alarmed the inhabitants of the </p><p>Earth. </p><p> “There is a chance that humanity may yet escape</p><p>the consequences of an operation which would bring </p><p>about such regrettable (geographical and meteoro- </p><p>logical changes in the Surface of the globe. Is it </p><p>possible to construct a cannon of the dimensions </p><p>622 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>required? We are of opinion that it is very doubt- </p><p>ful if it can be done. </p><p> “It is well known that the two chief directors of</p><p>the North Polar Practical Association have left </p><p>Baltimore and America, probably for the purpose of </p><p>attempting the manufacture of this cannon in some </p><p>distant part of the world. </p><p> “Where they have gone to is unknown, and con-</p><p>sequently it is impossible to secure the malefactors </p><p>who would upset the world under pretense of open- </p><p>ing up new coal-fields. </p><p> “Evidently the place was indicated on the last</p><p>page of the note-book captured by the police from </p><p>J. T. Maston. But this last page had disappeared, </p><p>having been swallowed by the said J. T. Maston, </p><p>now in prison at Baltimore. </p><p> “Such is the position. If Impey Barbicane can</p><p>make his cannon and his projectile, he will change </p><p>the earth’s axis, and within the next six months the </p><p>earth will be subjected to his reckless assault. </p><p> “A date has been chosen for the discharge of the</p><p>projectile, the date on which the shock would have </p><p>its maximum of effect on the terrestrial spheroid. </p><p> “This date is the 22nd of September, twelve hours</p><p>after the passage of the Sun across the meridian </p><p>of the place x. </p><p> “This place it is impossible from the calculations</p><p>to discover. </p><p> “There is nothing in J. T. Maston’s note-book to</p><p>show the position of the new axis, </p><p> “It is therefore impossible to state what terri-</p><p>tories or seas will be affected by the attempt. </p><p> “The difference of level will be considerable.</p><p>After the shock the surface of the sea will take the </p><p>form of an ellipsoid of revolution, and the level will </p><p>change nearly all over the globe. </p><p> “In fact the intersection of the level of the old</p><p>sea with the level of the new sea, of two equal </p><p>surfaces of revolution with the axes intersecting, </p><p>will be of two curved planes, and the maxima of ele- </p><p>vation or abasement will exceed 25,000 feet. </p><p> “It is worthy of remark that the ancient Pole will</p><p>be immersed under more than 9000 feet of water, so</p><p>that the district acquired by the North Polar Prac- </p><p>tical Association will be flooded unless there exists </p><p>at the Pole a plateau of more than that number </p><p>of feet of elevation. </p><p> "Where the maximum of alteration of land will</p><p>take place is unknown. There is in the equation </p><p>an unknown quantity, which no known formula can </p><p>evaluate. This unknown is the position of x, where </p><p>the shock is to be applied. This x is the secret of </p><p>the promoters of this deplorable affair. </p><p> “In conclusion, it is desirable to point out that</p><p>all the inhabitants of the Earth are interested </p><p>in unraveling the secret, for all are menaced by the </p><p>proceedings of the Association. </p><p> “Notice is therefore given to the inhabitants of</p><p>all parts of the world to keep a strict watch over </p><p>all operations regarding the founding of cannons, </p><p>or the fabrication of powders or projectiles taking </p><p>place on their territories, and to report the appear- </p><p>ance of any stranger connected therewith to the </p><p>Commission of Inquiry at Baltimore, U. S. A. </p><p> “It is urgently necessary that the information</p><p>should reach the Commission before the 22nd of </p><p>September next, the date on which the established </p><p>order of the terrestrial system is so seriously </p><p>menaced.” </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>Heroic Silence </p><p>IT was a cannon that hurled the projectile up to </p><p>the Moon; it was to be a cannon that was to </p><p>change the terrestrial axis? The cannon! Al- </p><p>ways the cannon! Barbicane and Co. evidently suf- </p><p>fered from chronic attacks of aggravated “cannon- </p><p>ism”! Was a cannon the ultima ratio of the world? </p><p>Was it to be the brutal sovereign of the universe? </p><p>The canon rules theology, was the cannon to give </p><p>the law to commerce and cosmology? </p><p> A cannon was the engine Barbicane &amp; Co. were</p><p>to bring into action. They had not devoted their </p><p>lives to ballistics for nothing. After the Columbiad </p><p>of Tampa Town there was to come the monster can- </p><p>non of—of—the place of x! And already there </p><p>were people who could hear the sonorous command: </p><p>“No. 1! Aim at the Moon! Fire!” </p><p> “No. 2! Change the Earth’s axis! Firel”</p><p> And then for the “general upset” predicted by</p><p>Vitrolic Alcide! </p><p> The publication of the report of the Commission</p><p>produced an effect of which it is impossible even to </p><p>give an idea. There was nothing in it of a soothing </p><p>tendency, it must be admitted. By J. T. Maston’s </p><p>calculations, the problem had evidently been solved. </p><p>The operation to be attempted by Barbicane &amp; Co. </p><p>would, it was only too clear, introduce a most re- </p><p>grettable modification in the dkirnal movement. </p><p>A new axis would be substituted for the old. And </p><p>we know what would be the consequences of that </p><p>substitution. </p><p> The enterprise of Barbicane &amp; Co. was thus</p><p>judged, cursed, and demitted to general reprobation. </p><p>Barbicane &amp; Co. were dangers to society. If they </p><p>retained a few partisans in the United States, they </p><p>were few indeed. </p><p>Interesting for the Inhabitants of the Terrestrial </p><p>Spheroid </p><p>FROM the point of view of their own personal </p><p>safety, Impey Barbicane and Captain Nicholl </p><p>had certainly done wisely to clear out. They would </p><p>assuredly have come to grief if they had not done </p><p>so. It was not with impunity that they could men- </p><p>ace fourteen hundred millions of people, upset their </p><p>habits and customs, and disturb their very existence </p><p>by provoking a general catastrophe. </p><p> But how had these two men managed to dis-</p><p>appear without leaving a trace? How could they </p><p>have gotten away unperceived with the men and </p><p>material necessary for their project? Hundreds of </p><p>wagons, if they went by railway, and hundreds of </p><p>ships, if they went by sea, would be required for </p><p>the transport of the metal, the fuel, and the meli- </p><p>melonite. It was quite incomprehensible how the </p><p>departure could have taken place incognito. But it </p><p>had taken place nevertheless. </p><p> Inquiries were made, but nothing was discovered</p><p>as to any order being sent to any of the metallur- </p><p>gical or chemical works of the world. It was in- </p><p>explicable! But the explanation would come—some </p><p>day! </p><p> Barbicane and Nicholl having mysteriously dis-</p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE </p><p>appeared, were beyond immediate danger. But 3. </p><p>T. Maston! He was under lock and key; but were </p><p>not public reprisals to be feared ? Bah! He did not </p><p>trouble himself about that in the least! Admirably </p><p>obstinate was the calculator! He was of iron—like </p><p>bis fore-arm! At nothing did he quail! </p><p> From the depths of his cell in the jail of Baltimore</p><p>the secretary of the Gun Club became more and more </p><p>absorbed in the distant contemplation of the col- </p><p>leagues he had not accompanied. In his mind’s </p><p>eye he could see Barbicane and Nicholl preparing </p><p>their gigantic enterprise in that unknown region </p><p>where no one could interefere with them. He saw </p><p>them making the cannon, mixing the meli-melonite, </p><p>casting the projectile which the Sun would soon </p><p>count among its minor asteroids! That new star </p><p>which was to bear the name of Scorbitta, as a deli- </p><p>cate compliment to the millionaire of New Park! </p><p>J. T. Maston began to count the days that would </p><p>elapse before the word to fire was given. </p><p> It was the month of April. In two months and</p><p>a half the Sun would halt at the solstice on the </p><p>Tropic of Cancer and retrograde toward the Tropic </p><p>of Capricorn. Three months later he would cross </p><p>the Equator at the autumnal equinox. And with </p><p>that would finish the seasons that for millions of </p><p>ages had alternated with such regularity in every </p><p>terrestrial year. For the last time the spheroid </p><p>would submit to the inequality of its days and </p><p>nights. For the future the number of hours be- </p><p>tween sunrise and sunset would be equal all over </p><p>the globe. </p><p> In truth it was a magnificent work! J. T. Maston</p><p>forgot all about the Polar coal-field in contemplat- </p><p>ing the cosmographical consequences of his labors. </p><p>The principal object of the Association had been </p><p>forgotten in the transformations the face of the </p><p>earth would undergo—notwithstanding that the </p><p>earth did not care about these magnificent transfor- </p><p>mations. </p><p> J. T. Maston, alone and defenseless in his cell,</p><p>resisted every pressure brought to bear on him. The </p><p>members of the Commission of Inquiry visited him </p><p>daily, and obtained nothing. It occurred at last to </p><p>John Prestice to make use of an influence that </p><p>might succeed better than his—that of Mrs. Scor- </p><p>bitt. No one was ignorant of the lengths to which </p><p>the widow would go when the celebrated calculator </p><p>was in peril. </p><p> There was a meeting of the Commission, and</p><p>Mrs. Scorbitt was authorized to visit the prisoner </p><p>as often as she thought fit. Was not she threatened</p><p>with the danger from the recoil of the monster </p><p>cannon as much as any other of the world’s in- </p><p>habitants? Would her New Park mansion escape </p><p>the final catastrophe any more than the wigwam </p><p>of the poor Indian or the humble hut of the back- </p><p>woodsman? Was not hsr life as much in danger </p><p>as that of the obscurest Samoyed or South Sea </p><p>Islander? The president of the Commission ela- </p><p>borately explained this to her, and suggested that </p><p>she should bring her influence to bear for the </p><p>genei*al good. </p><p> If she could only get J. T. Maston to state where</p><p>Barbicane and Nicholl had gone, there would still </p><p>be time to pursue them and save humanity from the </p><p>impending fate. </p><p>623 </p><p>A Mathematician in Jail </p><p> AND so Mrs. Scorbitt had access to the jail,</p><p> -i*- What she desired above all was to see J. T.</p><p> Maston, who had been torn by the police from the</p><p> comf«rts of this cottage. Let it not be supposed that</p><p> the heroic Evangelina was a slave to human weak-</p><p> ness. And if, on the 9th of April, some indiscreet</p><p> ear had been applied to the keyhole the first time</p><p> that the widow appeared in the cell, this is what</p><p> would have met it:</p><p>“At last, dear Maston, I see you again!” </p><p> “You, Mrs. Scorbitt!”</p><p> “Yes, my friend, after four weeks, four long</p><p> weeks of separation—”</p><p> “Exactly twenty-eight days, flve hours, forty-five</p><p> minutes,” said Maston, looking at his watch.</p><p> “At last we meet!”</p><p> “But why, Mrs. Scorbitt? Why have they allowed</p><p> you to come here?”</p><p> “To use whatever influence a boundless admira-</p><p> tion may have on him who is its object!”</p><p> “What!” exclaimed J. T. Maston, “you have con-</p><p> sented to talk thus to me! You have imagined that</p><p> I	would betray my colleagues?”</p><p> “Do you think so meanly of me? I to ask you to</p><p> sacrifice your safety to your honor? I to urge you</p><p> to an act which would be the disgrace of a life con-</p><p> secrated to the highest speculations of the higher</p><p> mechanics?”</p><p> “Bravo, Mrs. Scorbitt! I recognize the worthy</p><p> shareholder of our Association! Never did I doubt</p><p> your courage!”</p><p> “Thank you, dear Maston.”</p><p> “As for me, to divulge our work; to reveal at</p><p> what spot on the surface of the earth our effort is</p><p> to be made; to sell the secret I fortunately kept</p><p> hidden within me; to permit these barbarians to</p><p> launch off in pursuit of our friends, to interrupt</p><p> the labors they are engaged in for our profit and</p><p> our glory! I would rather die first!”</p><p>“Maston, you are sublime!” said Evangelina. </p><p> In truth, these two beings, so closely united in</p><p> enthusiasm—and equally mad*-were born to under-</p><p> stand each other.</p><p> “No!” continued Maston. “Never shall they know</p><p> the name of the country which my calculations have</p><p> designated, and which will become immortal. They</p><p> may kill me if they will, but they shall never pos-</p><p> sess my secret.”</p><p> “And they may kill me with you,” said Mrs. Scor-</p><p> bitt; “for I also will be dumb.”</p><p> “Fortunately, they do not know that you possess</p><p> the secret.’*</p><p> “Do you think I am capable of revealing it be-</p><p> cause I am only a woman ? to betray our colleagues</p><p> and you? No, my friend; no! The philistines may</p><p> raise the world against you to tear you from your</p><p> cell, but I will be with you, and we shall have at</p><p> least the consolation of dying together!”</p><p> And that was the way the conversatfon ended</p><p> every time the widow visited the prisoner. And</p><p> every time the Commissioners inquired as to the re-</p><p> sult the answer was the same.</p><p> “Nothing yet; but in time I hope to obtain what</p><p> you want I”</p><p> Gh, the astuteness of woman!</p><p>“In time!” she said. But time marched on; week </p><p>624 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>went by like days, days like hours, hours like </p><p>minutes. </p><p> It was now May. Mrs. Scorbitt had obtained</p><p>nothing; and if she failed, who could hope to suc- </p><p>ceed? Was the world to resign itself to this </p><p>terrible blow without a chance of hindering it? </p><p>The Chorus of Terror </p><p>TT7'ELL, no! in such things resignation is un- </p><p> W acceptable. Our friends the delegates were</p><p>unceasing in fomenting the excitement. Jansen </p><p>overwhelmed the Commissioners daily. Karkoff </p><p>picked a quarrel with the secretary. Donellan, to </p><p>make things worse, directed attention to another </p><p>victim in the shape of the codfish merchant, Fors- </p><p>ter, who had sunk into insignificance after the </p><p>auction sale, to bid at which he had been engaged. </p><p>And in order to bring the phlegmatic fishmonger </p><p>prominently to the front, the Canadian attempted </p><p>to knock him down. To complicate matters further, </p><p>“the friendly Powers” began “to bring pressure to </p><p>bear” on the Washington Government, which had </p><p>quite enough to do to withstand the “pressure” of </p><p>its own people. In reply the Washington Govern- </p><p>ment issued a circular authorizing the arrest of </p><p>the two “malefactors” by any power whatsoever. </p><p>But none the less did it remain impossible to dis- </p><p>cover where the malefactors had gone. </p><p> Then the Powers hinted that if J. T. Maston</p><p>were properly dealt with, J. T., Maston would re- </p><p>veal the secret. But the Government might as </p><p>well have tried to extract a word from Harpocrates, </p><p>the god of silence, or from the chief deaf-mute of </p><p>the New York Institute. </p><p> And then the exasperation increased with the</p><p>general anxiety, and a few practical minds drew </p><p>attention to the fact that the torture system of the </p><p>Middle Ages was not without some advantages. </p><p>So it was proposed to introduce, for the benefit of </p><p>J. T. Maston, a few experiments with the “boot,” </p><p>the “scavenger’s daughter,” “molten lead,” “boiling </p><p>oil,” the “wooden horse,” the “bastinado,” etc., etc. </p><p>But such things were impossible in the century </p><p>which invented the magazine rifle, roburite, bellite, </p><p>panclastite, and other “ites,” not to mention the </p><p>far superior meli-melonite. </p><p> J. T. Maston had, then, no fear of being put to</p><p>the torture. All that could be done with him was </p><p>to hope that he would speak, or that chance would</p><p>speak for him. </p><p>CHAPTER XIII </p><p>A Truly Epic Reply </p><p>TIME advanced, and so probably did the works </p><p>of Barbicane &amp; Co., but where, was the </p><p>mystery. </p><p> But if their works were to require a foundry</p><p>capable of casting a gun a million times larger </p><p>than a four-hundred pounder, and a projectile </p><p>weighing one hundred and eighty thousand tons, </p><p>they would want thousands of workmen; and where, </p><p>oh! where could they be? </p><p> In what part of the old or new world had Bar-</p><p>bicane &amp; Co. installed themselves so secretly as to </p><p>be invisible to the nations around ? Had they gone </p><p>to some desert island of the Pacific? But there are </p><p> bo desert islands now. That they had gone to the</p><p>Arctic or Antarctic regions was extremely unlikely, </p><p>for those were the very regions they intended to </p><p>displace. </p><p> There was no need to look for them all over the</p><p>world, for J. T. Maston’s note-book had revealed the </p><p>fact that the shot must be fired from near the </p><p>equator. Along the equinoctial line, they might </p><p>be in Brazil or Peru, or Sumatra, or Borneo, or </p><p>Celebes, or New Guinea, but surely they would have </p><p>been discovered by the people in the neighborhood? </p><p>All through Africa, too, they would be almost cer- </p><p>tain of discovery. There remained the Maldive </p><p>Islands, the Admiralty, Gilbert, and Christmas Is- </p><p>lands, the Galapagos and San Pedro Islands; but </p><p>all these had been searched, and no trace of Barbi- </p><p>cane &amp; Co. had been found. </p><p> And what did Alcide Pierdeux think of all this?</p><p>More “sulphuric” than ever, he knew no rest in </p><p>considering the different consequences of the prob- </p><p>lem. That Captain Nicholl had invented an explo- </p><p>sive of such power that its expansion was three </p><p>or four thousand times greater than the most </p><p>violent explosives used in modern war, and five </p><p>thousand six hundred times stronger than “good </p><p>old gun-powder,” was, he remarked, “etonnant, not </p><p>to say dttonmnt!” but it was not impossible. No </p><p>one knows what the future has in store for us in </p><p>that kind of progress. In the shifting of the Earth’s </p><p>axis by means of the recoil of a gun there was </p><p>nothing to surprise him. </p><p> “It is evident,” he said to himself,” that every</p><p>day the Earth receives the counter-shock from </p><p>every shock produced on its surface! It is certain</p><p>that when hundreds of thousands of men amuse </p><p>themselves by sending thousands of projectiles </p><p>weighing pounds, or millions weighing ounces, even </p><p>when I walk or jump, or when I stretch out my arm, </p><p>or when a blood corpuscle circulates in my veins, </p><p>it must in some way influence the mass of our </p><p>spheroid. But in the name of an integral will Bar- </p><p>bicane’s jolt be sufficient to upset the Earth? If </p><p>the equations of that brute Maston really demon- </p><p>strate that, we must make up our minds to it!” </p><p>A Great Mathematician </p><p>IN truth, Alcide could not but admire the ingeni- </p><p>ous calculations of the secretary of the Gun </p><p>Club, communicated by the Commission of Inquiry </p><p>to the mathematicians who could understand them. </p><p>And Alcide, who read algebra as if it were a news- </p><p>paper, found the study of them extremely interest- </p><p>ing. </p><p> But if the upset did come, what a dreadful state</p><p>of affairs there would be in the world! What cities </p><p>thrown down, what mountains shaken, what people </p><p>destroyed by millions, what waters hurled from </p><p>their beds, what fearful terrors! It would be such </p><p>an earthquake as had never quaked before! </p><p> “If Nicholl’s powder,” he said, “was not quite so</p><p> strong, the projectile might return t&amp; give the</p><p> Earth another shock either before or behind the</p><p> firing-point, after making the turn of the globe,</p><p> and then everything might soon be knocked back</p><p> into place, after causing immense destruction,</p><p> nevertheless! But they are going to throw it over-</p><p> board! Thanks to their meli-melonite th6ir shell</p><p> will describe the half of a hyperbola and never come</p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE </p><p> back to beg pardon for having given that kick to</p><p>the terrestrial ball!” </p><p> And Alcide threw his arms about like the sema-</p><p>phore at Portsmouth Dockyard, at the risk of break- </p><p>ing everything within a radius of six feet of him. </p><p> "If the firing-point were known I could soon find</p><p> the great circles in which the alteration will be zero,</p><p> and the places where it will reach the maximum, so</p><p> as to give folks notice to clear out and save them-</p><p> selves from being smashed by their houses tumbling</p><p> about their ears! But how am I to know that</p><p> firing-point?”</p><p> And he ran his fingers through the very little</p><p>hair that had been left him. </p><p> The results of the shock may be much more</p><p>complicated than they imagine! Why should not </p><p>the volcanoes take the opportunity to favor us with </p><p>a few disorderly eruptions, and, like a first voyager, </p><p>displace some of the matter in their insides? Why </p><p>should not the uplifted ocean take a header into </p><p>some of the craters? There’s a chance for you! </p><p>That would give an explosion that might send the </p><p>whole tellurian box of tricks sky high, or rather </p><p>sky higher! What do you say to that, you con- </p><p>founded Maston? You obstinate mute! What do </p><p>you mean by juggling with our poor Earth as if it </p><p>were a ball on a billiard table?” </p><p> These alarming hypotheses of Vitriolic ‘Alcide</p><p>were taken up and discussed by the newspapers all </p><p>over the world. The pyrotechnic display organized </p><p>by Barbicane &amp; Co. would end in waterspouts, tidal </p><p>waves, deluges, would it? But such catastrophes </p><p>would only be partial! Thousands of people would </p><p>disappear, and the rest would hardly notice any- </p><p>thing worth mentioning! As the fatal day ap- </p><p>proached, fear came over the bravest. It might </p><p>have been the dreadful year 1000 from the way in </p><p>which the people generally conducted themselves. </p><p> What happened in that year 1000 it may be inter-</p><p> esting to recall. Owing to a passage in the Apo-</p><p> calypse, the people of Europe were persuaded that</p><p> the Day of Judgement was nigh. They waited for</p><p> the signs of wrath; the son of Perdition, Antichrist,</p><p> was to be revealed.</p><p> “In the last year of the tenth century,” relates</p><p>H.	Martin, "everything was interrupted—pleasures,</p><p>business, interest, even the work in the fields. </p><p>‘Why,’ said the people, ‘should we provide for a </p><p>future that will never come? Let us think of eter-</p><p>nity, which will begin tomorrow.’ They provided </p><p>only for their immediate needs; they handed over </p><p>their lands and castles to the monasteries to obtain </p><p>their protection in the kingdom in the skies which </p><p>was about to come to them. Many of the deeds of </p><p>gift to the churches begin with the words, ‘The </p><p>end of the world approaching, and its ruin being </p><p>imminent.’ When the end of the fetal terra arrived </p><p>the people kept within the basilicas, the chapels, the </p><p>edifices consecrated to God, and waited in agony </p><p>for the seven trumpets of the seven angels of </p><p>judgment to sound in the sky.” </p><p>As we know, New Year's Day, 1000, was reached </p><p>without any disturbance in the laws of Nature. </p><p>But this time the expectation of the catastrophe </p><p>was not based on a doubtful interpretation of a </p><p>text. It was a change to be applied to the earth’s </p><p>equilibrium based on indisputable calculations </p><p>which the progress of the ballistic and mechanical </p><p> sciences rendered quite possible. This time it was</p><p> not the sea that would give back the dead, but the</p><p> sea that would engulf millions of the living.</p><p> Under these circumstances, the position of J. T.</p><p> Maston became daily more critical. Mrs. Scorbitt</p><p> trembled lest he should become the victim of the</p><p> general mania. Sometimes she thought of advising</p><p> him to speak the word which he so obstinately kept</p><p> to himself. But she dared not, and she did well.</p><p> It would have been to expose herself to a categorical</p><p> refusal.</p><p> The city of Baltimore was a prey to terror, and</p><p> it became difficult to restrain the populace, who</p><p> were being excited even unto madness by the news-</p><p> papers, by the telegrams which they published from</p><p> the four angles of the earth, to use the apocalyptic</p><p> language of St. John the Evangelist in the days of</p><p> Domitian. Assuredly, if J. T. Maston had lived</p><p> under that persecuting emperor, his business would</p><p> soon have been settled. He would have been thrown</p><p> to the beasts. But he would have contented himself</p><p> with replying:</p><p> “I am there already!”</p><p> Bat no matter what happened, he refused to re-</p><p>veal the position of place x, knowing well that if he </p><p>divulged it Barbicane and Nicholl would be pre- </p><p>vented from continuing their work. </p><p>One Man Against the World </p><p>A FTER all, there was something grand in this </p><p>struggle between one man and the entire world. </p><p>J. T. Maston increased in grandeur in the mind of</p><p>Mrs. Scorbitt, and also in the opinion of his col- </p><p>leagues of the Gun Club. These gallant fellows </p><p>were as obstinate as retired artillery men and never </p><p>swerved from their support of Barbicane &amp; Co. </p><p>The secretary of the Gun Club reached such a </p><p>height of celebrity that a number of persons even </p><p>wrote to him, as they do to famous criminals, to </p><p>obtain a few lines from the hand of the man </p><p>who was going to upset the globe. </p><p> This was all very fine, but it was more and more</p><p> dangerous. The populace thronged day and night</p><p> around the jail of Baltimore. There was great</p><p> shouting and much tumult. The mob would have</p><p> lynched J. T. Maston there and then if they could;</p><p> and the police saw the time was coming when they</p><p> could no longer protect him.</p><p> Desirous of satisfying the American mob, as well</p><p> as the mob of other countries, the Washington</p><p> Government decided to bring J. T. Maston to trial.</p><p> With a jury selected from the terrified masses,</p><p> “the affair would not hang about long,” to quote the</p><p> words of Alcide, who felt a kind of sympathy for the</p><p> calculator’s tenacity.</p><p> On the 5th of September, the President of the</p><p>Commission visited the prisoner in his cell. </p><p> Mrs. Scorbitt, at his urgent request, was allowed</p><p> to accompany him. Perhaps at the last attempt</p><p> the influence of this amiable lady might be success-</p><p> ful. It would not do to neglect anything. All</p><p> means were legitimate that might secure the word</p><p> of the enigma. If they did not succeed, they would</p><p> see!</p><p> “They will see!” said the knowing ones. “Sup-</p><p>pose they hang J. T. Maston, and the catastrophe </p><p>takes place all the same?” </p><p> At eleven o’clock, then, Maston found himself in</p><p>626 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> the presence of John Prestice and Evangelina Scor-</p><p> bitt.</p><p> “For the last time,” said Prestice, “will yon</p><p> answer me?"</p><p> “What about?" said Maston.</p><p> “Where has your colleague, Barbicane, gone to?”</p><p> “I have already told you a hundred times.”</p><p> “Repeat it for the hundred and first.”</p><p> “He has gone where he will fire the cannon.”</p><p> “And where will he fire the cannon?”</p><p> “Where Barbicane is at this present moment.”</p><p> “Take care, Maston!”</p><p> “Of what?”</p><p> “Of the consequences of your refusal to reply.</p><p> The result will be—”</p><p> “That you will not discover what you have no</p><p> right to know.”</p><p> “What we have the right to know.”</p><p> "That is not my opinion.”</p><p> “We are going to put you on your trial.”</p><p> "You can put me on my trial.”</p><p> “And the jury will find you guilty.”</p><p> "Let them find me guilty.”</p><p> “And the sentence will immediately be given and</p><p> immediately executed.”</p><p> r “Very well.”</p><p> "Dear Maston!” said Evangelina, whose heart</p><p> trembled at the prospect.</p><p> “Oh! Mrs. Scorbitt” said J. T. Maston.</p><p> She bowed her head, and was silent.</p><p> “Would you like to know what the sentence will</p><p> be—”</p><p> “Yes, if you like.”</p><p> “You will be hanged, as you deserve.”</p><p> “Really.”</p><p> “And you will be hanged, sir, as sure as two and</p><p> two make four.”</p><p> The Difference Between a Theorem and a Definition</p><p> «rpHEN, sir, I shall have a chance,” said the</p><p> 1 phlegmatic Maston. “If you were only the</p><p> least bit of a mathematician you would not say as</p><p> sure as two and two make four. What is it that</p><p> proves that all mathematicians up to now have not</p><p> been mad in asserting that the sum of two numbers</p><p> is equal to that of their parts, that two and two</p><p> make exactly four?”</p><p> “Sir!” exclaimed the president, completely puz-</p><p> zled.</p><p> “Ah!” continued Maston. “If you had said as</p><p> sure as one and one make two, all right! That is</p><p> absolutely evident, for it is no longer a theorem,</p><p> it is a definition.”</p><p> At this lesson in arithmetic, the president of the</p><p> Commission retired, while Mrs. Scorbitt’s eyes were</p><p> ablaze with admiration for the extraordinary abili-</p><p> ties of her beloved calculator.</p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p>The Geographical Value of X </p><p> FORTUNATELY for J. T. Maston, the Federal</p><p> Government unexpectedly received the fol-</p><p> lowing telegram:</p><p> “To John S. Wright, Washington, U. S. A.</p><p> “Zanzibar, 13th September, 5 a. m., local time.</p><p> Great foundries have been established among the</p><p> Wamasai to the south of Kilimanjaro. For eight</p><p>months Impey Barbicane and Nicholl have been </p><p>there, with hundreds of black workmen under the </p><p>authority of the Sultan Bali-Bali. Information for </p><p>Government purposes.—Richard W. Trust, U. S. </p><p>Consul.” </p><p> And that is how the great secret was discovered.</p><p>And that is why the secretary of the Gun Club was </p><p>not hanged. </p><p> But who can say that he did not live to regret</p><p>that he was not removed from mankind in all the </p><p>plenitude of his glory? </p><p> Anyhow the fact of the discovery is so important</p><p>in our history that we shall only be treating it with </p><p>due respect in giving it this chapter to itself. </p><p>CHAPTER XV </p><p>Interesting for the Inhabitants of the Terrestrial </p><p>Spheroid </p><p>AND so the Washington Government knew </p><p>Barbican &amp; Co. had commenced business. </p><p>There could be no doubt as to the authenti- </p><p>city of the telegram. The Consul of Zanzibar was </p><p>too cautious a man for his information to be </p><p>doubted, and it was confirmed by subsequent tele- </p><p>grams. The gigantic works of the North Polar </p><p>Practical Association were in full swing in the </p><p>center of the Kilimanjaro region, about three hun- </p><p>dred miles from the East Coast of Africa, a little </p><p>below the equinoctial line. </p><p> How had they come to be installed so secretly</p><p>in this lost country, at the foot of the famous </p><p>mountain discovered in 1848 by Krapf and Reb- </p><p>mann? How had Barbicane &amp; Co. been able to </p><p>build their foundries and collect their staff? By </p><p>what means had they managed to enter into peaceful </p><p>relations with the savage tribes of the districts, and </p><p>their cruel and grasping chiefs? Nobody knew. </p><p>And as there were only a few days to run before </p><p>the 22nd, it was not unlikely that nobody would </p><p>know. </p><p> When J. T. Maston learned from Evangelina that</p><p>the mystery of Kilimanjaro had been cleared up by </p><p>a telegram from Zanzibar— </p><p> “Pshaw!” he said, making a wonderful zigzag</p><p>in the air with his iron hook. "They do not travel </p><p>yet by telegraph or telephone; and in six days— </p><p>patarapatanboom-boom—all will be ready!” </p><p> And any one who heard the secretary of the Gun</p><p>Club deliver the sonorous onomatope, like a roar </p><p>from a Columbiad, would have wondered at the </p><p>amount of vital energy remaining in the old artil- </p><p>leryman. </p><p> But there was no doubt that he was right. There</p><p>was no time to send messengers to the Wamasai </p><p>to arrest Impey Barbicane. Even if the messengers </p><p>started from Egypt, or Aden, or Massowah, or </p><p>Zanzibar, however quickly they might travel, they </p><p>would have to contend with the difficulties of the </p><p>country, with the obstacles unavoidable on a road </p><p>through a mountainous region, and probably with </p><p>followers acting under the orders of a sultan as </p><p>despotic as he was black.</p><p> All hope would have to be given up of stopping</p><p>the operation or arresting the operator. </p><p> But, if that was impossible, nothing was easier</p><p>now than to know the worst that could happen. The </p><p>firing-point had been revealed, and it was a simple </p><p>THE PURCHASE OF </p><p> master 01 calculation—a complicated calculation</p><p> evidently, but not beyond the capacities of alge-</p><p> braists in particular and mathematicians in gen-</p><p> eral.</p><p> At first the Government kept the despatch secret,</p><p> their object being to be able to indicate when they</p><p> published it what would be the results of the dis-</p><p> placement of the axis with regard to the alteration</p><p> in the level of the waters.

In the sea that will be left there </p><p>will probably be many new islands, formed by the </p><p>summits of submarine mountain-chains. </p><p> “In the other segments the waters will rise tg</p><p>a corresponding height. </p><p> “In the segment north-east of Kilimanjaro the</p><p>maximum will be at Yakutsk in Siberia.

And such are the</p><p> eventualities for which those interested must pre-</p><p> pare, unless something happens to prevent the</p><p> dastardly enterprise of Barbicane &amp; Co.”</p><p>CHAPTER XVI </p><p>The Chorus of Terror </p><p>ACCORDING to the “important notice,” the </p><p>dangers of the position could be avoided, or </p><p>rather fled from, by hurrying off to the </p><p>neutral zones. </p><p> The people in peril could be divided into two</p><p>classes, the asphyxiated and the drowned. </p><p> The effect of the communication was to give rise</p><p> to very different opinions, which soon developed into</p><p> the most violent protestations.</p><p> On the side of the asphyxiated were the Ameri-</p><p>cans of the United States, the Europeans of the </p><p>United Kingdom, and France, Spain, etc. The </p><p>prospect of being able to annex territories from the </p><p>ocean-bed was not attractive enough to persuade </p><p>them to accept the change. </p><p> On the side of the drowned were the inhabitants</p><p> of South America, and the Hindoos, Russians, and</p><p> Chinese. But Great Britian was not likely to allow</p><p> Barbicane &amp; Co. to deprive her of her southern</p><p> colonies; and the other nations decidedly objected</p><p> to being so summarily disposed of. Evidently the</p><p> Gulf of Mexico would be emptied to form a huge</p><p> territory of the Antilles, which the Mexicans and</p><p> Americans might claim in accordance with the</p><p> Monroe Doctrine. Evidently the lift of the Philip-</p><p> pines and Celebes would bring up an immense</p><p> region which the British and Spanish might share.</p><p> But vain such compensation! It would never</p><p> balance the loss due to the terrible inundation.</p><p> If the new seas were only to rise over the</p><p>Samoyeds, Laps, Fuegians, Patagonians, Tartars </p><p>even, Chinese, Japanese, or even Argentines, the </p><p>world might have borne the bereavement. But the </p><p>catastrophe affected too many of the great Powers </p><p>for them to bear it quietly. </p><p> Although the central part would remain much as</p><p>it is, Europe would be lifted in the west and low- </p><p>ered in the east, that is to say half asphyxiated on</p><p>one side and half drowned on the other. </p><p> Such a state of affairs was unacceptable. Besides,</p><p> the Mediterranean would be nearly drained dry, and</p><p> that neither French, Italians, Spainards, G-reeks,</p><p> Turks, nor Egyptians cared for, as their position on</p><p> its coast gave them indisputable rights over the</p><p> sea. And what would be the use of the Suez Canal,</p><p> which would escape, owing to its position on the</p><p> neutral line? What was to be done with that when</p><p> there was no Mediterranean at one end and very</p><p> little Red Sea at the other—unless it was length-</p><p> ened by several hundred miles?</p><p> Great Britain had no desire to see Gibraltar,</p><p>Malta, and Cyprus transformed into mountain-tops </p><p>which ironclads would try to anchor near in vain. </p><p>And the British Government declined to entertain </p><p>in any form the suggested compensation from the </p><p>risen bed of the Atlantic. </p><p> In short, all the world was in arms against Bar-</p><p> bicane &amp; Co. Even the people on the neutral lines</p><p> were urgent in their protests. And so it soon came</p><p> about that Barbicane, Nicholl, and J. T. Maston were</p><p> put under the ban of humanity.</p><p> But how the newspapers prospered! What a</p><p>rush there was for copies! What editions after </p><p>editions! For the first time in the history of the </p><p>newspaper press all the papers of every country </p><p>in the world were agreed upon one matter. And the </p><p>effect of that is more easily imagined than des- </p><p>cribed! </p><p> J. T. Maston might well believe that his last hour</p><p> was come.</p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE	629</p><p>A Mob of Lynchers and an Empty Cell </p><p>T N fact, a frantic mob broke into his prison on the </p><p>■A evening of the 17th of September with the inten- </p><p>tion of lynching him, and it is well to say, the police </p><p>made no objection. </p><p> The cell was empty! With the worthy calcu-</p><p>lator’s weight in gold, Mrs. Scorbitt had managed </p><p>his escape. The jailer was the more ready to be </p><p>bribed by a fortune as he had hopes of enjoying it </p><p>for some years. In fact, Baltimore, like Washing- </p><p>ton, New York, and the other chief cities of the </p><p>Atlantic seaboard, was in the list of towns to be </p><p>reasonably elevated, and in which there would re- </p><p>main enough air for the daily consumption of their </p><p>inhabitants. </p><p> J. T.

The important </p><p>notice had been generally understood. If there had </p><p>been a few skeptics before, there were none now. </p><p>The Government issued proclamations to such of </p><p>their peoples as were to be sent up into the rarefied </p><p>air, and to the greater number that were to be </p><p>dropped into deep water. </p><p> The result was such a migration as had never</p><p>been seen, not even when the Aryan families began </p><p>to remove. An exodus took place comprising every </p><p>branch of the Hottentots, Melanesians, Negroes, </p><p>Red Men, Yellow Men, Brown Men, White Men. </p><p> Unfortunately the time was too short. It could</p><p>be reckoned in hours. Given a few months, the </p><p>Chinese might abandon China, the Australians </p><p>Australia, the Patagonians Patagonia, the Siberians </p><p>Siberia. </p><p> But time! Time! The time! How was it pos-</p><p>sible? </p><p> Migration was useless.</p><p> There was only one chane!</p><p>Suppose that Barbicane &amp; Co. were to fail? </p><p>CHAPTER XVII </p><p>The Works at Kilimanjaro </p><p>THE country of the Wamasai is situated in</p><p>the east of Central Africa, between Zanzi- </p><p>bar and the great lakes. Our knowledge of </p><p>it is due chiefly to Thomson, Johnston, Count </p><p>Tekeli and Doctor Meyer. It is a mountainous dis- </p><p>trict under the sovereignty of the Sultan Bali-Bali, </p><p>whose people are negroes, and number from thirty </p><p>to forty thousand. </p><p> Three degrees south of the Equator rises the</p><p>chain of Kilimanjaro, which lifts its highest sum- </p><p>mit over 18,000 feet above the sea, and commands </p><p>northward, southward, and westward, the vast and </p><p>fertile plains of the Wamasai. </p><p> A few miles below the first slopes of the mountain</p><p>lies the town of Kisongo, where the Sultan resides. </p><p>The capital is, truth to tell, but a large village. It </p><p>is occupied by a population, highly gifted and intel- </p><p>ligent, and working hard as much by itself as by </p><p>its slaves under the iron yoke of Bali-Bali, who is </p><p>justly considered to be one of the most remarkable </p><p>sovereigns of Central Africa. </p><p> Impey Barbicane and Captain Nicholl, accom-</p><p>panied by ten foremen devoted to the enterprise, had </p><p>arrived at Kisongo in the first week of January. </p><p>The fact of their departure had only been communi- </p><p>cated to J. T. Maston and Mrs. Scorbitt. They had </p><p>embarked at New York for the Cape of Good Hope; </p><p>thence they had gone to Zanzibar; and a bark, </p><p>secretly chartered, had taken them to Mombasa on </p><p>the other side of the channel. An escort from the </p><p>Sultan had met them at this port, and after a diffi- </p><p>cult journey of about 300 miles across this harassed </p><p>region, obstructed by forests, cut up by streams, </p><p>and checkered with marshes, they had reached the </p><p>royal residence. </p><p> As soon as he had obtained J. T. Maston’s cal-</p><p>culations, Barbicane had put himself in communi- </p><p>cation with Bali-Bali through a Swedish explorer </p><p>who intended to spend a few years in this part of </p><p>Africa. The Sultan had become one of the warmest </p><p>admirers of the audacious Yankee after the cele- </p><p>brated Moon Voyage, the fame of which had spread </p><p>even to this distant country. Without disclosing </p><p>his object Barbicane had obtained from the Wama- </p><p>sai the needful authority to open important works </p><p>at the southern base of Kilimanjaro. For the very </p><p>considerable sum of three hundred thousand dol- </p><p>lars Bali-Bali had engaged to furnish him with the </p><p>labor he required to do what he liked with Kiliman- </p><p>jaro. He could take it down if he liked, or carry </p><p>it away if he could; and he became as much the </p><p>owner of the mountain as he was of the North </p><p>Pole. </p><p>The Works in Africa</p><p>BARBICANE and his colleague were cordially </p><p>welcomed at Kisongo. Bali-Bali felt an ad- </p><p>miration bordering on adoration for the two illus- </p><p>trious voyagers who had launched out in space to </p><p>attain the circumlunar regions, and sympathized </p><p>enthusiastically with the projectors of the myste- </p><p>rious works they wished to establish in his kingdom. </p><p>He undertook that the enterprise should be kept </p><p>secret, both by himself and his subjects, for all of </p><p>whom he could answer, as not one of the negroes </p><p>engaged had the right to leave the works for a day </p><p>under penalty of the most dreadful punishments. </p><p> On this account the operation was enveloped in a</p><p>mystery that the cleverest detectives of America </p><p>and Europe failed to penetrate, and if it was dis- </p><p>covered at last it was because the Sultan had relaxed </p><p>his severity after the completion of the works, and </p><p>because there are traitors or chatterers even among </p><p>negroes. It was in this way that Richard W. Trust, </p><p>the consul at Zanzibar, got wind of what was hap- </p><p>pening at Kilimanjaro. But at that date, the 13th </p><p>of September, it was too late to stop Barbicane in </p><p>the accomplishment of his plans. </p><p> The reason that Barbicane &amp; Co. had chosen the</p><p>country of the Wamasai as the scene of their opera- </p><p>tions was that, in the first place, it was little known </p><p>and rarely visited by travelers, and, secondly, that </p><p>the mass of Kilimanjaro offered all the qualities of </p><p>solidity and position necessary for their work. Be </p><p>sides, the country was rich in all the materials they </p><p>required, and these were found under conditions </p><p>that made them easily workable. </p><p> A few months before leaving the United States,</p><p>Barbicane had learned from the Swedish explorer </p><p>630 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>that iron and coal were abundant in the Kiliman- </p><p>jaro chain. There were no mines to be opened, and </p><p>no shafts to be driven thousands of feet into the </p><p>crust of the earth. The minerals were on the sur- </p><p>face, and had only to be picked up from the ground. </p><p>And in addition to these, there were large deposits </p><p>of nitrate of soda and iron pyrites, such as were </p><p>required for the manufacture of the meli-melonite. </p><p> Barbicane and Nicholl had brought no staff of</p><p>workmen with them except the ten foremen, on </p><p>whom they could depend. These could take com- </p><p>mand of the ten thousand negroes placed at their </p><p>disposal by Bali-Bali, to whom was entrusted the </p><p>task of making the monster cannon and its no less </p><p>monster projectile. </p><p> A fortnight after the arrival of Barbicane and</p><p>his colleague among the Wamasai, three large work- </p><p>shops had been erected in the south of the moun- </p><p>tain; one as the foundry for the gun, one as the </p><p>foundry for the shot, and one as the factory for the </p><p>meli-melonite. </p><p> And how did Barbicane &amp; Co. intend to cast a</p><p>cannon of such colossal dimensions? The only </p><p>chance for the inhabitants of the world was, as we </p><p>have seen, in the difficulty of dealing with such a </p><p>huge undertaking. </p><p> To cast a cannon a million times larger than a</p><p>four hundred pounder would have been beyond the </p><p>power of man. To make a four hundred pounder </p><p>is difficult enough, but a four hundred million </p><p>pounder! Barbicane &amp; Co. did not attempt to do </p><p>so. It was not a cannon nor even a mortar, that </p><p>they had in their minds. They simply intended to </p><p>drive a gallery into the mountain. </p><p> Evidently this enormous mine would have the</p><p>eame effect as a gigantic Columbiad, the manu- </p><p>facture of which would have been as oostly as it </p><p>was difficult, owing to the thickness it would have </p><p>to be to avoid the risk of bursting. Barbicane &amp; </p><p>Co. had always intended to act in this way, and if </p><p>J. T. Maston’s note-book spoke of a cannon, it was </p><p>the four hundred pounder he had taken as the basis </p><p>of his calculations. </p><p> Consequently, a spot was chosen a hundred feet</p><p>up the southern side of the chain, from the base of </p><p>which the plains extended for miles and miles, so </p><p>that nothing would be in the way of the projectile </p><p>when it was hurled from the long tube in the mass </p><p>of Kilimanjaro.</p><p> With great precision and much labor Barbicane</p><p>carried on the driving of his tunnel. Easy to him </p><p>was the construction of boring machines worked </p><p>with air compressed by the power of the large </p><p>waterfalls in the district. The holes bored by the </p><p>machines were charged with meli-melonite, and the </p><p>blasting of the rock was easy, it being a kind of </p><p>syenite composed of orthoclasic felspar and amphi- </p><p>bolic hornblende. It was a favorable circumstance </p><p>that a rock so constituted would strongly resist the </p><p>frightful pressure developed by the expansion of </p><p>the gas; but the height and thickness of the moun- </p><p>tain afforded ample security against any exterior </p><p>splitting or cracking. </p><p>The Great Gun Is Finished </p><p>THE thousands of workmen under the guidance </p><p>of the ten foremen, superintended by Barbi- </p><p>cane, progressed with such zeal and intelligence that </p><p>in less than six months the tunnel was finished. It </p><p>measured nearly ninety feet in diameter and two </p><p>thousand feet long. As it was important that the </p><p>projectile should glide along a perfectly smooth </p><p>surface without losing any of the gas deflagration, </p><p>the interior was lined with a smooth tube of cast </p><p>iron. This was a much larger affair than the cele- </p><p>brated Columbiad of Tampa Town, which had sent </p><p>the aluminum projectile around the Moon. But </p><p>what is there that is impossible to the engineers of </p><p>the modern world? </p><p> While the boring went on in the flank of Kiliman-</p><p>jaro, the workmen were busy at the second foundry. </p><p>While the tube was being built the enormous pro- </p><p>jectile was in process of manufacture. </p><p> All it consisted of was a mass of cast-iron, cylin-</p><p>droconical in form, weighing one hundred and eight </p><p>thousand tons. It had never been intended to make </p><p>such a casting in one piece, but to provide one hun- </p><p>dred and eighty masses, each of one thousand tons, </p><p>which could be hoisted into the tube and arranged </p><p>in front of the meli-melonite so as to form a com- </p><p>pact charge. </p><p> It thus became necessary to furnish the second</p><p>foundry with four hundred thousand tons of ore, </p><p>seventy thousand tons of flux, and four hundred </p><p>thousand tons of good coal, which at the outset was </p><p>transformed into two hundred and eighty thousand </p><p>tons of coke. As the deposits were all in the vicinity, </p><p>this was only a matter of transport. </p><p> The greatest difficulty was the construction of the</p><p>blast furnaces for dealing with the ore; but never-</p><p>theless, before a month was out ten furnaces were </p><p>at work, capable, each, of an output of one hundred </p><p>and eighty tons a day. This gave eighteen hun- </p><p>dred tons in the twenty-four hours, and a hundred </p><p>and eighty thousand tons in ten working days. </p><p> In the meli-melonite factory the work went on</p><p>easily, and so secretly that the composition of the </p><p>explosive was never discovered. All went well; and </p><p>there was hardly an accident to mar the progress. </p><p> The Sultan was delighted. He followed the</p><p>operations with indefatigable assiduity, and it may </p><p>be imagined how his Majesty’s presence stimulated </p><p>the zeal of his faithful subjects. </p><p> When he asked what it all meant, Barbicane</p><p>would reply engimatically: </p><p> “It is a work which will change the face of the</p><p>world!” </p><p> “A work,” Captain Nicholl would add, “that will</p><p>confer on the Sultan Bali-Bali a glory that will </p><p>never fade among the monarchs of Eastern Africa!” </p><p> And that the Sultan of the Wamasai felt proud</p><p>there is no need for us to insist! </p><p>The Great Projectile </p><p>ON the 29th of August the works were completed. </p><p>The tunnel was lined with the smooth iron </p><p>tube built up within it. At the end lay stored two </p><p>thousand tons of meli-melonite in communication </p><p>with the box of fulminate. Then came the pro- </p><p>jectile three hundred and forty-five feet long. In </p><p>front of the projectile was a space of fourteen hun- </p><p>dred and fifty feet in which effect would be given </p><p>to the impulse due to the expansion of the gas. </p><p> That being the case, there remained the question</p><p>—a question of pure "ballistics—would the projectile </p><p>have the trajectory assigned to it by J. T. Maston? </p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE </p><p>631 </p><p>The calculations were correct. They indicated in </p><p>what measure the projectile would deviate to the </p><p>east of the meridian of Kilimanjaro in virtue of </p><p>the earth's rotation, and what would be the form </p><p>of the hyperbolic curve which it described in virtue </p><p>of its enormous initial velocity. </p><p> Second question: Would it be visible during its</p><p>flight? No, for when it left the tube plunged in </p><p>the darkness of the earth, it could not be seen, and </p><p>besides owing to its moderate height it would have </p><p>a very considerable angular velocity. Once it </p><p>entered the zone of light, the smallness of its volume </p><p>would conceal it from the most powerful glasses, </p><p>and for a stronger reason it would, when free from </p><p>the influence of terrestrial attraction, gravitate for- </p><p>ever around the Sun. </p><p> Assuredly Barbicane &amp; Co. might be proud of</p><p>the work they were about to complete. Why was </p><p>not J. T. Maston there to admire the admirable </p><p>execution of the works which was worthy of the </p><p>precision of the calculations that had ispired them? </p><p>And above all things why was he far away when </p><p>the formidable detonation would awake the echoes </p><p>of the most distant horizons of Africa? </p><p> In thinking of him his colleagues had no notion</p><p>that he had had to leave Ballistic Cottage after </p><p>escaping from Baltimore jail, and was now in hid- </p><p>ing to save his precious life. They knew not to </p><p>what a degree public opinion had risen against the </p><p>North Polar Practical Association. They knew </p><p>not what would be the massacres, quarterings, and </p><p>roastings if the people happened to lay hold of them. </p><p>Indeed they were fortunate that when the mine </p><p>was fired they could only be saluted by the shouts </p><p>of the Wamasai. </p><p> “At last!” said Captain Nicholl, when on the</p><p>evening of the 22nd of September they were stroll- </p><p>ing about at the mouth of the mine. </p><p> “Yes! At last! And also—Ha!” and Barbicane</p><p>gave a sigh of relief. </p><p> “If you had to begin again?”</p><p> “Bah! We should begin again!”</p><p> “What luck,” said Nicholl, “that we should have</p><p>at our disposal this admirable meli-melonite!” </p><p>“Which will make you illustrious Nicholl!” </p><p>“Doubtless, Barbicane,” said the captain modestly. </p><p>“But do you know how many galleries we should</p><p>have had to drive in the flanks of Kilimanjaro to </p><p>obtain the same result if we had only gun-cotton </p><p>like that which flung our projectile at the Moon?” </p><p>“Tell me.” </p><p> “One hundred and eighty, Barbicane!”</p><p> “Well, we would have driven them!”</p><p> “And a hundred and eighty projectiles of a hun-</p><p>dred and eighty thousand tons!” </p><p> “We would have made them, Nicholl!”</p><p> There *is no nonsense about men of this stamp.</p><p>But when artillerists have made the round of the </p><p>Moon, of what could they not be capable? </p><p>An Excited Mathematician </p><p>AND that very evening, an hour or two only be- </p><p>fore the discharge was to take place, and while </p><p>Barbicane and Nicholl were thus congratulating </p><p>themselves, Alcide Pierdeux, shut up in his room </p><p>at Baltimore, jumped to his feet and whooped like </p><p>a Redskin. </p><p> “Whoooop! Mr. J. T. Maston! You brute, you</p><p>shall swallow your problem, you shall! And why </p><p>didn’t I see that before! In the name of a cosine! </p><p>If I knew where you were I would ask you to supper, </p><p>and we would have a glass of champagne together </p><p>at the very moment your gun is to go off!” </p><p> And he capered around the room and whirled his</p><p>arms about like a railway signal gone mad. </p><p> “Whoooop, you old plum-tree! You must have</p><p>had a big bang when you calculated the cannon of </p><p>Kilimanjaro! Hurrah for the cannon of Kiliman- </p><p>jaro; and how many more would you like? That </p><p>is not only the sine qua non, my boy, but the sine </p><p>cannon I Whoooop! ’ ’ </p><p>CHAPTER XVIII </p><p>The Wamasai Wait far the Word to Fire </p><p>IT was the evening of the 22nd of September— </p><p>that memorable date to which public opinion </p><p>assigned an influence as disastrous as that of </p><p>the 1st of January, 1000. </p><p> Twelve hours after the sun passed the meridian</p><p>of Kilimanjaro, that is to say, at midnight, the hand </p><p>of Captain Nicholl would fire the terrible mine. </p><p> From Kilimanjaro to Baltimore is one hundred</p><p>and fourteen degrees, or a difference in time of four </p><p>hundred and fifty-six minutes. At the moment of </p><p>discharge it would be twenty-four minutes past </p><p>five in the afternoon in the great city of Maryland. </p><p> The weather was magnificent. The sun had just</p><p>set on the plains of the Wamasai behind a perfectly </p><p>clear horizon. Barbicane &amp; Co. could not have </p><p>wished for a better night, a calmer or a more star- </p><p>lit one, in which to hurl their projectile into space. </p><p>There was not a cloud to mingle with the artificial </p><p>vapor developed by the deflagration of the meli- </p><p>melonite. </p><p> Who knows? Perhaps Barbicane and Nicholl</p><p>were regretting that they could not take their places </p><p>inside the projectile? In the first second they could </p><p>have traveled over seventeen hundred miles! After </p><p>having penetrated the mysteries of the lunar world, </p><p>they would have penetrated those of the solar world, </p><p>and under conditions differently interesting from </p><p>those of Hector Servadac on the comet Gallia! </p><p> The Sultan Bali-Bali, the great personages of his</p><p>court, that is to say, his minister of finance and his </p><p>minister of works, and the staff of black workmen, </p><p>were gathered together to watch their final opera- </p><p>tion. But, with commendable prudence, they had </p><p>taken up their position three miles away from the </p><p>mouth of the mine, so as to suffer no inconvenience </p><p>from the disturbance of the atmosphere. </p><p> Around them were a few thousand natives from</p><p>Kisongo and the villages in the south of the prov- </p><p>ince, who had been ordered by the Sultan to come </p><p>and admire the spectacle. </p><p> A wire connecting an electric battery with the</p><p>detonator of the fulminate in the tube lay ready to </p><p>fire the meli-melonite. </p><p> As a prelude, an excellent repast had assembled</p><p>at the same table the Sultan, his American visitors, </p><p>and the notabilities of the capital—the whole at the </p><p>cost of Bali-Bali, who did the thing all the better </p><p>from his knowing he would be reimbursed out of the </p><p>ample purse of Barbicane &amp; Co. </p><p> It was eleven o’clock when the banquet, which had</p><p>begun at half-past seven, came to an end by a toast </p><p>632 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>proposed by the Sultan in honor of the engineers of </p><p>the North Polar Practical Association and the suc- </p><p>cess of their undertaking. </p><p>A Failure </p><p>IN an hour the modification of the geographical </p><p>and climatological conditions of the Earth </p><p>would be an accomplished fact- </p><p> Barbicane, his colleague, and the ten foremen be-</p><p> gan to take up their places around the hut in which</p><p> the electric battery was placed.</p><p>Barbicane, chronometer in hand, counted the </p><p>minutes—and never did they seem so long—those </p><p>minutes which seemed not years, but centuries! </p><p>At ten minutes to twelve he and Captain Nicholl </p><p>approached the apparatus which put the wire in </p><p>communication with the cannon of Kilimanjaro. </p><p>The Sultan, his court, the crowd of natives </p><p>formed an immense circle around them. </p><p> It was essential that the discharge should take</p><p> place at the precise moment indicated in the calcula-</p><p> tions of J. T. Maston, that is at the instant the sun</p><p> touched the equinoctial line, which henceforth he</p><p> would never leave in his apparent orbit around the</p><p> terrestrial spheroid.</p><p> Five minutes to twelve!</p><p> Faur minutes to twelve!</p><p> Three minutes to twelve!</p><p>Two minutes to twelve! </p><p> One minute to twelve!</p><p>Barbicane followed the hand of the chronometer, </p><p>which was lighted by a lantern held by one of the </p><p>foremen. </p><p> Captain Nicholl stood with his finger on the but-</p><p> ton of the apparatus ready to close the circuit.</p><p>Twenty seconds to twelve! </p><p>Ten seconds! </p><p>There was not the suspicion of a shake in the </p><p>hand of the impassible Captain Nicholl. He and his</p><p>friend were no more excited than when, shut up in </p><p>the projectile, they waited for the Columbiad to </p><p>despatch them to the Moon. </p><p> Five seconds!</p><p>One! </p><p> “Fire!” said Barbicane.</p><p> And Nicholl’s finger pressed the button.</p><p>The noise was truly awful. The echoes rolled in </p><p>thunders far beyond the realm of the Wamasai. </p><p>There was a shrill shriek of the projectile which </p><p>traversed the air under the impetus from milliards </p><p>of milliards of litres of gas developed by the in- </p><p>stantaneous deflagration of two thousand tons of </p><p>meli-melonite. It seemed as though there had passed </p><p>over the surface of the Earth one of those storms in </p><p>which are gathered all the fury of Nature. </p><p> And the effect could have been no more terrible if</p><p> all the guns of all the artilleries of the world had</p><p> been joined to the thunders of the sky to give one</p><p> long continuous roar together.</p><p>CHAPTER XIX </p><p>J. T. Maston Regrets He Was Not Lynched </p><p>THE capitals of the globe—and also the less </p><p>important towns, and even the humbler vil- </p><p>lages—were, as a rule, waiting for the result </p><p>in a paroxysm of terror. The newspapers took care </p><p>that the exact moment corresponding to midnight </p><p>at Kilimanjaro should be thoroughly well known. </p><p> At Baltimore, as we are aware, twelve hours after</p><p>the passage of the Sun on the meridian of Kiliman- </p><p>jaro, it would be 5:24 p. m. </p><p> We need not enlarge on the agony of these mo-</p><p>ments. The most pewerful pen of modern times </p><p>would be helpless to describe them. </p><p> That the inhabitants of Baltimore ran no dan-</p><p>ger of being swept away by the rising sea may be </p><p>very true! That they would not see Chesapeake </p><p>Bay empty itself, and Cape Hatteras at the end be- </p><p>come a mountain crest above the dried Atlantic, is </p><p>agreed! But the city, like many others not menaced </p><p>with emersion or immersion, might be shattered by </p><p>the shock, its monuments thrown down, and its </p><p>streets engulfed in the abysses that might open in </p><p>the ground! And was there not a justification for </p><p>fearing for those other parts of the world which</p><p>would never survive the displacement of the waters? </p><p> Why, certainly!</p><p> And so every human being in that city felt a cold</p><p>shiver in the spinal marrow during that fatal </p><p>minute. Yes! all trembled with terror—but one! </p><p>And that one was Vitrolic Alcide, who was quietly </p><p>sipping a cup of hot coffee as if he and the old world </p><p>would last forever. </p><p> 5:24 p. m., answering to Kilimanjaro midnight,</p><p>passed. </p><p> At Baltimore—nothing occurred!</p><p> At London, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Constantinople—</p><p>nothing! Not the least shock! </p><p> Professor Milne, in the coal-pit at Kagoshina, in</p><p>Japan, gazed steadily at the seismograph, and saw </p><p>not the least abnormal movement in the crust of the </p><p>Earth in that part of the world. </p><p> At Baltimore there was no sign of any disturb-</p><p>ance whatsoever. The sky was cloudy, and when </p><p>the night came it was impossible to see if the ap- </p><p>parent movement of the stars had changed—which </p><p>would, of course, have indicated a change in the </p><p>Earth’s axis. </p><p>Explanation </p><p>WHAT a night did J. T. Maston pass in his re- </p><p>treat, unknown to all save Mrs. Scorbitt! He </p><p>raged! He raved! He could not keep still. Would </p><p>that he had been a few days older, to see if the </p><p>curve of the Sun was modified—an indisputable </p><p>proof of the success of the operation. On the 23rd </p><p>the change would not be noticeable, for on that day </p><p>the Sun invariably rises due east in every country </p><p>of the globe. </p><p> In the morning the Sun rose just as usual.</p><p> Major Donellan and his friends were on the ter-</p><p>race of their hotel. They had furnished themselves </p><p>with instruments of extreme precision, which would </p><p>show if the Sun described its curve in the plane of </p><p>the Equator. </p><p> There was nothing to show that it did; and a few</p><p>minutes after it had risen the radiant disk inclined </p><p>toward the southern hemisphere. </p><p> There was no change in its apparent path.</p><p> The Major and his colleagues expressed their de-</p><p>light by giving three cheers for the Sun. </p><p> The sky was superb, the horizon quite clear from</p><p>the mists of the night, and never did the glorious </p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE </p><p>633 </p><p>orb present himself under greater conditions of </p><p>splendor before a wondering people. </p><p> “And the very place noted by the laws of astron-</p><p> omy!” said Baldenak.</p><p> “Of our old astronomy,” said Karkof, “which these</p><p> madmen attempted to annihilate!”</p><p> “To their cost and shame,” said Jansen.</p><p> “And the Arctic regions will remain under their</p><p> eternal ice!” said Professor Harald.</p><p> “Hurrah for the Sun!” shouted Donellan. “He is</p><p> good enough for us as he is!”</p><p> “Hurrah! hurrah!” said the others on the bal-</p><p> cony.</p><p> Then it was that Todrin, who had said nothing,</p><p> remarked judiciously, “Perhaps they have not</p><p> fired!”</p><p> “Not fired?” ejaculated the Major aghast.</p><p> And that, with a different intonation, was what</p><p> J. T. Maston and Mrs. Scorbitt said.</p><p> “Not fired?”</p><p> And that was what the wise and the foolish were</p><p> asking; and it was what Alcide Pierdeux said, add-</p><p> ing, “Whether they fired or no, it does not matter!</p><p> The Earth will still spin on its old axis!”</p><p> No one knew what had passed at Kilimanjaro;</p><p> but before the end of the day an answer was given</p><p> to the question that puzzled humanity.</p><p> There was a telegram from Zanzibar:—</p><p> “To John S. Wright, Washington, U. S. A.</p><p> . ‘'Zanzibar, 23rd September, 7:27 a. m., local time.</p><p> Discharge took place at midnight from cannon on</p><p> southern side of Kilimanjaro. Projectile traveled</p><p> with fearful shriek. Awful explosion. Province</p><p> devastated by a tornado. Sea risen in the Mozam-</p><p> bique Channel. Many ships damaged and driven on</p><p> shore. Towns and villages annihilated. All well,</p><p> as usual.—Richard W. Trust, U. S. Consul.”</p><p> Yes. All well as usual I Nothing changed in the</p><p> state of affairs except the disasters among the</p><p> Wamasai caused by the artificial tornado and the</p><p> wrecks caused by the risen sea.</p><p> And had it not been the same when the famous</p><p> Columbia had sent its projectile toward the Moon?</p><p> The shock communicated to the soil of Florida had</p><p> only been experienced for a hundred miles around.</p><p> But this time the effect ought to have been a hun-</p><p> dred times as great.</p><p> Under any circumstances the telegram informed</p><p> the world of two matters of interest:—</p><p> 1.	The enormous cannon had been made in the</p><p> flank of Kilimanjaro.</p><p> 2.	It had been fired at the time stated.</p><p>Paying the African Money </p><p> AND then the world gave a shout of satisfaction,</p><p> which was followed by an immense shout of</p><p> laughter.</p><p> Barbicane &amp; Co.’s attempt had failed piteously!</p><p> J. T. Maston’s calculations might as well be put in</p><p> the wastepaper basket! The North Polar Practical</p><p> Association had nothing now to do but go into</p><p> another kind of liquidation!</p><p> Could it be possible that the secretary of the</p><p> Gun Club had made a mistake?</p><p> “I would rather believe I am deceived in the</p><p> affection with which he inspires me,” said Mrs.</p><p> Evangelina Scorbitt.</p><p> And if there was a discomfited being on the face</p><p> of the planet it was J. T. Maston. When he saw</p><p> that nothing had changed in the conditions of the</p><p> Earth’s movement, he was buoyed up with hope that</p><p> some accident had retarded the work of Barbicane</p><p> and Nicholl.</p><p> But since the Zanzibar telegram he had to admit</p><p>that the experiment had failed. </p><p> Failed? And the equations, the formulae from</p><p>which he had deduced the success of the enterprise! </p><p>Was the gun not long enough, the projectile not </p><p>heavy enough, the explosive not strong enough? No! </p><p>It was inadmissible! </p><p> J. T. Maston was in such a state of excitement</p><p>that he declared he would leave his retreat. Mrs. </p><p>Scorbit tried in vain to prevent him. Not that she </p><p>feared for his life, for the danger was over. But</p><p>the pleasantries that would be showered on the un- </p><p>happy calculator, the jokes that would rain on his </p><p>work—she would have spared him. </p><p> And, still more serious, what was the reception</p><p>the Gun Club would give him? Would they retain </p><p>him as their secretary after a failure that covered </p><p>them with ridicule? Was not he, the author of the </p><p>calculations, entirely responsible for the collapse? </p><p> He would listen to nothing. He would yield</p><p>neither to the tears nor prayers of Mrs. Scorbitt. He </p><p>came out of the house in which he was hidden. He </p><p>appeared in the streets of Baltimore. He was </p><p>recognized, and those whom he had menaced in their </p><p>fortune and existence, whose anxiety he had pro- </p><p>longed by his obstinate silence, took vengeance on </p><p>him by deriding him in every way. </p><p> The street boys shouted after him, “Go along, old</p><p>Pole-shifter!” “Hallo, old clock-jobber!” “How’s </p><p>the figuring tinker?” </p><p> And a mob gathered and began to hustle him, and</p><p>he had to seek refuge in the New Park mansion, </p><p>where Mrs. Scorbitt did her best to console him. It </p><p>was in vain. </p><p> J. T. Maston—after the example of Niobe—would</p><p>not be consoled. His gun had produced no more </p><p>effect on the terrestrial spheroid than an ordinary </p><p>fire cracker. </p><p> A fortnight went by, and the world had already</p><p>forgotten the North Polar Practical Association. A </p><p>fortnight, and no news of Barbicane or Captain </p><p>Nicholl! Had they perished in the counter-shock </p><p>of the explosion, victims to the ravages produced </p><p>among the Wamasai? Had they paid with their </p><p>lives for the biggest mystification of modern times? </p><p> No. At the explosion Barbicane and Nicholl had</p><p>been thrown down; so had the Sultan, and several </p><p>thousand natives; but they had all risen again safe </p><p>and sound. </p><p> “Is it a success?” asked Bali-Bali, rubbing his</p><p>shoulders. </p><p> “Can you doubt it?”</p><p> “I—doubt it! But when shall we know?”</p><p> “In a day or two!” said Barbicane.</p><p> Did he see that the attempt had failed?</p><p> Possibly. But he never would have admitted it</p><p>to the monarch of the Wamasai. </p><p> Two days afterward Barbicane and Nicholl took</p><p>their leave of Bali-Bali, not without paying a good </p><p>round sum for the destruction done to the surface </p><p>of his kingdom. And as the money went to his own </p><p>private pocket, and his subjects got not a dollar, he </p><p>had no cause to regret so lucrative an affair. </p><p>634 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> Then the two friends, followed by their foremen,</p><p> reached Zanzibar, where they found a vessel start-</p><p> ing for Suez.

Nicholl ?”</p><p> |-£ “Maston!”</p><p> JLJ “You?”</p><p> “We!”</p><p> And in that pronoun, spoken simultaneously by</p><p> the two in a singular tone, there was everything</p><p> that could be said in the way of irony and reproach.</p><p> J. T. Maston passed his iron hook across his fore-</p><p> head. Then in a voice that hissed between his lips</p><p> he asked:</p><p> “Your gallery at Kilimanjaro was two thousand</p><p> feet long and ninety in diameter?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Your projectile weighed one hundred and eighty</p><p> thousand tons?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “And you used two thousand tons of meli-</p><p> melonite?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> The three yes’s fell like blows of a sledge-hammer</p><p> on J. T. Maston’s occiput.</p><p> “Then I conclude—” he said.</p><p> “What?” asked Barbicane.</p><p> “That, as the experiment failed, the explosive did</p><p> not give the projectile the necessary initial velo-</p><p> city !”</p><p> “Indeed!” said Captain Nicholl.</p><p> “And that your meli-melonite is only fit for pop-</p><p> guns !”</p><p> Captain Nicholl started at the insult.</p><p> “Maston!” he exclaimed.</p><p> “Nicholl!”</p><p> “Will you fight me with meli-melonite?”</p><p> “No; with gun-cotton. It is surer!”</p><p> Mrs. Scorbitt hastened to interfere.</p><p> “Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” she said. “Between</p><p> friends!”</p><p> Then Impey Barbicane put in a word very quietly.</p><p> “What is the use of abusing each other? It is</p><p> certain that the calculations of our friend Maston</p><p> were correct, and it is certain that the explosive of</p><p> our friend Nicholl was sufficient 1 We followed ex-</p><p> actly the teachings of science! And we failed! For</p><p> what reason? Probably we shall never know!”</p><p> “Well,” said the secretary of the Gun Club; “we</p><p> will try it again!”</p><p> “And the money which has been lost?” observed</p><p> Captain Nicholl.</p><p> “And public opinion, which will not permit you</p><p> to again risk the fate of the world?” added Mrs.</p><p> Scorbitt.</p><p> What will become of the North Pole?” asked</p><p>Nicholl. </p><p> “What is the value of the shares in the North</p><p>Polar Practical Association?” asked Barbicane. </p><p> Oh, what a fall there had been thereof! The</p><p>certificates could be bought at waste-paper prices. </p><p>Ridicule Develops </p><p>SUCH was the memorable fiasco of the gigantic </p><p>project of Barbicane &amp; Co. </p><p> If ever unfortunate engineers were overwhelmed</p><p>with ridicule, if ever there were amusing articles in </p><p>the newspapers, caricatures, comic songs, parodies </p><p>—it was then. Barbicane, the director of the Associa- </p><p>tion, the members of the Gun Club, were literally </p><p>covered with scorn. The storm of contempt was so </p><p>thoroughly American that it was untranslatable even </p><p>in Volapuk. And Europe joined in with such vigor </p><p>that at last America was scandalized. And then </p><p>remembering that Barbicane, Nicholl, and Maston </p><p>were of American birth, and belonged to the famous </p><p>club of Baltimore, a reaction in their favor set in, </p><p>which was almost strong enough to make the United </p><p>States declare war against the Old World. </p><p> But was it ever to be known why the enterprise</p><p>failed? Did the failure prove that the project was </p><p>impossible, that the forces of which man disposes </p><p>will never be sufficient to bring about a change in </p><p>the Earth’s diurnal movement, that never would the </p><p>Polar regions be displaced in latitude to such an </p><p>extent that their icy mantle will be melted by the </p><p>solar rays? </p><p> That this was the case appeared undoubted a few</p><p>days after the return of Barbicane and Nicholl to </p><p>the United States. </p><p> A letter appeared in the Parisian Temps of the</p><p>17th of October, which did mankind a service in con- </p><p>firming it in its feeling of security. </p><p>A Letter from the Great Mathematician </p><p>HE letter was the following:— </p><p> “The abortive attempt to furnish the Earth</p><p>with a new axis is now known. Nevertheless, the </p><p>calculations of J. T. Maston were correctly founded, </p><p>and would have produced the desired results if by </p><p>some inexplicable distraction they had not been nul- </p><p>lified by an error at the outset. </p><p> “In fact, the celebrated secretary of the Gun Club'</p><p>took for his basis the circumference of the terres- </p><p>trial spheroid at forty thousand metres instead of </p><p>forty million metres—and that nullified the solution. </p><p> “How came he to make 3uch an error? What</p><p>could have caused it.? How could so remarkable a </p><p>mathematician have made such a mistake? Con- </p><p>jecture is vain. </p><p> “There is no doubt that the problem of the change</p><p>of the terrestrial axis was correctly stated, and it </p><p>should have been correctly worked out. But the </p><p>initial error of three noughts produced an error of </p><p>twelve noughts in the final result</p><p> “It is not a cannon a million times as large as a</p><p>four hundred-pounder, but a million million million </p><p>such cannons, hurling a million million million pro- </p><p>jectiles of one hundred and eighty thousand tons, </p><p>that would displace the Pole 23° 28', supposing that </p><p>melio-melonite has the expansive power attributed </p><p>to it by Captain Nicholl. </p><p>“In short, the discharge of the projectile at Kili- </p><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE </p><p>635 </p><p>manjaro has been to displace the Pole three microns </p><p>—that is, one ten-thousandth of an inch, and the </p><p>maximum effect on the level of the sea must have </p><p>been just nine-thousandths of a micron. </p><p> “The projectile has become a small planet and</p><p>henceforth belongs to our system, in which it is re- </p><p>tained by the solar attraction. </p><p>“Alcide Pierdeux.” </p><p> So it was some distraction of J. T. Maston’s, an</p><p>error of three noughts at the beginning of his cal- </p><p>culations, that had brought this humiliating disaster </p><p>on Barbicane &amp; Co. </p><p> The members of the Gun Club were furious, but</p><p>among the general public a reaction arose in favor </p><p>of the poor fellow. After all, it was this mistake </p><p>which had caused all the evil—or rather all the </p><p>good, for it saved the world from ruin. </p><p> And so compliments came in from all parts, and</p><p>letters arrived in millions congratulating J. T. Mas- </p><p>ton on having forgotten his three noughts! </p><p> But that extraordinary man, more deeply dis-</p><p>gusted than ever, would not listen to the congratu- </p><p>latory world. Barbicane, Nicholl, Tom Hunter </p><p>with the wooden leg, Colonel Bloomsberry, the </p><p>brisk Bilsby, and their friends, would never for* </p><p>give him. </p><p> But at least there remained Mrs. Scorbitt!</p><p> At first J. T. Maston refused to admit that he</p><p>had made a mistake; and set to work to check his </p><p>calculations. </p><p> Vitriolic Alcide was, however, accurate. And that</p><p>was why, when he found the error at the last mo- </p><p>ment, and had no time to reassure his fellow-men he </p><p>so calmly sipped his pleasant hot cup of coffee while </p><p>the spinal marrow was so unpleasantly cool in his </p><p>fellow-men’s backs. </p><p> There was no disguising the fact. Three noughts</p><p>had slipped out of the terrestial waist! </p><p> Then it was that J. T. Maston remembered! It</p><p>was at the beginning of his labors when he had shut </p><p>himself up in Ballistic Cottage. He had written </p><p>the number of 40,000,000 on the blackboard. </p><p> At that moment came a hurried tinkle from the</p><p>telephone. He had gone to the instrument. He had </p><p>exchanged a few words with Mrs. Scorbitt. There </p><p>was a flash of lightning that upset him and his </p><p>blackboard. He picked himself and his blackboard </p><p>up. He began to write in the figures half rubbed </p><p>out by the falL He had just written 40,000—when </p><p>the bell rang a second time. And when he returned </p><p>to work he had forgotten the three last noughts in </p><p>the measure of the Earth’s equator! </p><p>Now all that was the fault of Mrs. Scorbitt. If </p><p>she had not bothered him he would never have been </p><p>knocked down by the return shock of that electrical </p><p>discharge. </p><p> And so the unhappy woman also received a shock</p><p>when J. T. Maston told her how the mistake had </p><p>been made. Yes! She was the cause of the disas- </p><p>ter ! It was her doing that J. T. Maston was now </p><p>dishonored for the many years he had to live, for </p><p>it was the general custom to die as centenarians in </p><p>the Gun Club. </p><p> And after the interview J. T. Maston fled from</p><p>the house in New Park. He went back to Ballistic </p><p>Cottage. He strode about his work-room saying to </p><p>himself: </p><p> “Now I am good for nothing in the world!”</p><p> “Not even if you were to marry?” said a voice</p><p>which emotion made heartrending. </p><p> It was Mi-s. Scorbitt.</p><p> Tearful and distracted she had followed J. T.</p><p>Maston. </p><p> “Dear Maston!” said she.</p><p> “Well! Yes!” said he; “on one condition—that I</p><p>never again touch mathematics.” </p><p>A Happy Marriage </p><p>«t ABOMINATE them!” said the widow. </p><p> J. And thus it was that Mrs. Scorbitt became</p><p>Mrs. J. T. Maston. </p><p> As to Alcide Pierdeux, what honor, what celebrity</p><p>that letter brought him and his old school! Trans- </p><p>lated into all languages, copied into all newspapers, </p><p>it made his name known throughout the world. </p><p> It happened, therefore, that the father of the</p><p>pretty Provemjale, who had refused him his daugh-</p><p>ter’s hand because he was too learned, came to read </p><p>the famous letter in the Petit Marseillais. Without </p><p>any assistance he managed to make out its meaning. </p><p>And then he was seized with remorse, and, as a pre- </p><p>liminary measure, sent Vitriolic Alcide an invitation </p><p>to dinner. </p><p> And so the world was left as it was.</p><p> No attempt was made by Barbicane &amp; Co. to re-</p><p>sume business. Any attempt would have been futile. </p><p>Aclide’s contention was indisputable. It could be </p><p>shown by mechanics that to effect a displacement </p><p>of 23° 28', even with meli-melonite, so many Kili- </p><p>manjaro guns or mines would be required, that the </p><p>surface of the earth could not hold them. </p><p> The world’s inhabitants could thus sleep in peace.</p><p>To modify the conditions of the Earth’s movement </p><p>is beyond the powers of man. It is not given to </p><p>mankind to change the order established by the </p><p>Creator in the system of the Universe. </p><p> The End</p><p>Hail And Good-By </p><p> By Leland S.

He gave such a strange account of him- </p><p>self that he was supposed demented. Subsequently </p><p>he alleged that his mind was a blank from the mo- </p><p>ment of his escape from the Lady Vadn. His case </p><p>was discussed among psychologists at the time as </p><p>a curious instance of the lapse of memory conse- </p><p>quent upon physical and mental stress. The fol- </p><p>lowing narrative was found among his papers by the </p><p>undersigned, his nephew and heir, but unaccom- </p><p>panied by any definite request for publication. </p><p> The only island known to exist in the region in</p><p>which my ucle was picked up is Noble’s Isle, a small </p><p>volcanic islet and uninhabited. It was visited in </p><p>1891 by H. M. S. Scorpion. A party of sailors then </p><p>landed, but found nothing living thereon except cer- </p><p>tain curious white moths, some hogs and rabbits, </p><p>and some rather peculiar rats. So that this narra- </p><p>tive is without confirmation in its most essential </p><p>particular. With that understood, there seems no </p><p>harm in putting this strange story before the pub- </p><p>lic in accordance, as I believe, with my uncle’s in- </p><p>tentions. There is at least this much in its behalf: </p><p>my unele passed out of human knowledge afeout </p><p>latitude 5° S. and longitude 105° E., and reappeared </p><p>in the same part of the ocean after a space of eleven </p><p>months. In some way he must have lived during the </p><p>interval. And it seems that a schooner called the </p><p>Ipecacuanha with a drunken captain, John Davies, </p><p>did start from Africa with a puma and certain other </p><p>animals aboard in January, 1887, that the vessel </p><p>was well known at several ports in the South Pacific, </p><p>and that it finally disappeared from those seas (with </p><p>a considerable amount of copra aboard), sailing to </p><p>its unknown fate from Bayna in December, 1887, </p><p>a date that tallies entirely with my uncle’s story. </p><p>Charles Edward Prendick. </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p> By H. G. WELLS</p><p> (The Story written by Edward Prendick.)</p><p>CHAPTER I. </p><p>In the Dingey of the “Lady Vain” </p><p>DO not propose to add anything to what </p><p>has already been written concerning the </p><p>loss of the “Lady Vain." As every one </p><p>knows, she collided with a derelict when </p><p>ten days out from Callao. The long- </p><p>boat, with seven of the crew, was picked up eigh- </p><p>teen days after by H. M. </p><p>gunboat “Myrtle," and the </p><p>story of their terrible pri- </p><p>vations has become quite </p><p>as well known as the far </p><p>more horrible “Medztsa” </p><p>case. But I have to add </p><p>to the published story of </p><p>the “Lady Vain” another, </p><p>possibly as horrible and </p><p>far stranger. It has </p><p>hitherto been supposed </p><p>that the four men who </p><p>were in the dingey perish- </p><p>ed, but this is incorrect. </p><p>I have the best of evidence </p><p>for this assertion: I was </p><p>one of the four men. </p><p> But in the first place I</p><p>must state that there never were four men in the </p><p>dingey,—the number was three. Constans, who </p><p>was “seen by the captain to jump into the gig,”1 </p><p>luckily for us and unluckily for himself did not </p><p>reach us. He came down out of the tangle of ropes </p><p>under the stays of the smashed bowsprit, some rope </p><p>caught his heel as he let go, and he hung for a </p><p>moment head downward, and then fell and struck </p><p>a block or spar floating in the water. We pulled </p><p>towards him, but he never came up. </p><p> I say luckily for us he did not reach us, and I</p><p>might almost say luckily for himself; for we had </p><p>only a small breaker of water and some soddened </p><p>ship’s biscuits with us, so sudden had been the </p><p>alarm, so unprepared the ship for any disaster. We </p><p>thought the people on the launch would be better </p><p>provisioned (though it </p><p>seeras they were not), </p><p>and we tried to hail them. </p><p>They could not have heard </p><p>us, and the next morning </p><p>when the drizzle cleared, </p><p>—which was not until </p><p>past midday,—we could</p><p>see nothing of them. We </p><p>could not stand up to look </p><p>about us, because of the </p><p>pitching of the boat. The </p><p>two other men who had </p><p>escaped so far with me </p><p>were a man named Hel- </p><p>mar, a passenger like my- </p><p>self, and a seaman whose </p><p>name I don’t know,—a </p><p>short sturdy man, with a </p><p>stammer. </p><p> We drifted famishing, and, after our water had</p><p>come to an end, tormented by an intolerable thirst, </p><p>for eight days altogether. After the second day the </p><p>sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm. It is quite </p><p>impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those </p><p>eight days.

After the </p><p>first day we said little to one another, and lay in </p><p>our places in the boat and stared at the horizon, or </p><p>watched, with eyes that grew larger and more hag- </p><p>gard every day, the misery and weakness gaining </p><p>upon our companions. The sun became pitiless. The </p><p>water ended on the fourth day, and we were already </p><p>thinking strange things and saying them with our </p><p>eyes; but it was, I think, the sixth before Helmar </p><p>gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking. I </p><p>remember our voices were dry and thin, so that we </p><p>bent towards one another and spared our words. I </p><p>stood out against it with all my might, was rather </p><p>for scuttling the boat and perishing together among </p><p>the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar said </p><p>that if his proposal was accepted we should have </p><p>drink, the sailor came round to him. </p><p> I would not draw lots however, and in the night</p><p>the sailor whispered to Helmar again and again, </p><p>and I sat in the bows with my clasp-knife in my </p><p>hand, though I doubt if I had the stuff in me to </p><p>fight; and in the morning I agreed to Helmar’s </p><p>proposal, and we handed halfpence to find the odd </p><p>man. The lot fell upon the sailor; but he was the </p><p>strongest of us and would not abide by it, and </p><p>attacked Helmar with his hands. They grappled </p><p>together and almost stood up. I crawled along the </p><p>boat to them, intending to help Helmar by grasp- </p><p>ing the sailor’s leg; but the sailor stumbled with </p><p>the swaying of the boat, and the two fell upon the </p><p>gunwale and rolled overboard together. They sank </p><p>like stones. I remember laughing at that, and won- </p><p>dering why I laughed. The laugh caught me sud- </p><p>denly like a thing from without. </p><p> I lay across on one of the thwarts for I know not</p><p>how long, thinking that if I had the strength I </p><p>would drink sea-water and madden myself to die </p><p>quickly. And even as I lay there I saw, with no </p><p>more interest than if it had been a picture, a sail </p><p>come up towards me over the skyline. My mind </p><p>must have been wandering, and yet I remember all </p><p>that happened, quite distinctly. I remember how my </p><p>head swayed with the seas, and the horizon with the </p><p>sail above it danced up and down; but I also re- </p><p>member as distinctly that I had a persuasion that I </p><p>was dead, and that I thought what a jest it was that </p><p>they should come too late by such a little to catch </p><p>me in my body. </p><p> For an endless period, it seemed to me, I lay with</p><p>my head on the thwart watching the schooner (she </p><p>was a little vessel, schooner-rigged, fore and aft) </p><p>come up out of the sea. She kept tacking to and</p><p>fro in a widening compass, for she was working </p><p>dead into the wind. It never entered my head to </p><p>attempt to attract attention, and I do not remem- </p><p>ber anything distinctly after the sight of her side </p><p>until I found myself in a little cabin aft. There’s </p><p>a dim half-memory of being lifted up to the gang- </p><p>way, and of a big red countenance covered with </p><p>freckles and surrounded with red hair staring at </p><p>me over the bulwarks. I also had a disconnected </p><p>impression of a dark face, with extraordinary eyes, </p><p>close to mine; but that I thought was a nightmare, </p><p>until I met it again. I fancy I recollect some stuff </p><p>being poured in between my teeth; and that is all. </p><p>CHAPTER II. </p><p>The Man Who Was Going Nowhere </p><p>THE cabin in which I found myself was small </p><p>and rather untidy. A youngish man with </p><p>flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured mous- </p><p>tache, and a dropping nether lip, was sitting and </p><p>holding my wrist. For a minute we stared at each </p><p>other without speaking. He had watery grey eyes, </p><p>oddly void of expression. Then just overhead came </p><p>a sound like an iron bedstead being knocked about, </p><p>and the low angry growling of some large animal. </p><p>At the same time the man spoke. He repeated his </p><p>question,— </p><p> “How do you feel now?”</p><p> I think I said I felt all right. I could not recol-</p><p>lect how I had got there. He must have seen the </p><p>question in my face, for my voice was inaccessible </p><p>to me. </p><p> “You were picked up in a boat, starving. The</p><p>name on the boat was the *Lady Vain/ and there </p><p>were spots of blood on the gunwale.” </p><p> At the same time my eye caught my hand, thin</p><p>so that it looked like a dirty skin-purse full of loose </p><p>bones, and all the business of the boat came back to </p><p>me. </p><p> “Have some of this,” said he, and gave me a dose</p><p>of some scarlet stuff, iced. </p><p>It tasted like blood, and made me feel stronger. </p><p> “You were in luck,” said he, “to get picked up</p><p>by a ship with a medical man aboard.” He spoke </p><p>with a slobbering articulation, with the ghost of a </p><p>lisp. </p><p> What ship is this?” I said slowly, hoarse from</p><p>my long silence.</p><p> “It’s a little trader from Arica and Callao. I</p><p>never asked where she came from in the beginning, </p><p>—out of the land of born fools, I guess. I’m a pas- </p><p>senger myself, from Arica. The silly ass who </p><p>owns her,—he’s captain too, named Davies,—he’s </p><p>lost his certificate, or something. You know the </p><p>kind of man,—calls the thing the ‘Ipecacuanha,’ of </p><p>all silly, infernal names; though when there’s much </p><p>of a sea without any wind, she certainly acts ac- </p><p>cording.” </p><p> (Then the noise overhead began again, a snarling</p><p>growl and the voice of a human being together. </p><p>Then another voice, telling some “Heaven-forsaken </p><p>idiot” to desist.) </p><p> ‘You were nearly dead,” said my interlocutor.</p><p>“It was a very near thing, indeed. But I’ve put </p><p>some stuff into you now. Notice your arm’s sore? </p><p>Injections. You’ve been insensible for nearly thirty </p><p>hours.” </p><p> I thought slowly. (I was distracted now by the</p><p>yelping of a number of dogs.) “Am I eligible for </p><p>solid food?” I asked. </p><p> “Thanks to me,” he said. “Even now the mutton</p><p>is boiling.” </p><p> 'Yes,” I said with assurance; “I could eat some</p><p>mutton.” </p><p> “But,” said he with a momentary hesitation, “you</p><p>know I’m dying to hear of how you came to be alone </p><p>in that boat. Damn that howling!” I thought I </p><p>detected a certain suspicion in his eyes. </p><p> He suddenly left the cabin, and I heard him in</p><p>violent controversy with some one, who seemed to </p><p>me to talk gibberish in response to him. The mat- </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU	639</p><p>ter sounded as though it ended in blows, but in that </p><p>1 thought my ears were mistaken. Then he shouted </p><p>at the dogs, and returned to the cabin. </p><p> “Well? said he in the doorway. “You were just</p><p>beginning to tell me." </p><p> I told him my name, Edward Prendick, and how I</p><p>had taken to Natural History as a relief from the </p><p>dullness of my confortable independence. </p><p> He seemed interested in this. “I’ve done some</p><p>science myself. I did Biology at University College, </p><p>—getting out the ovary of the earthworm and the </p><p>radula of the snail, and all that. Lord! It’s ten </p><p>years ago. But go on! go on! tell me about the </p><p>boat.” </p><p> He was evidently satisfied with the frankness of</p><p>my story, which I told in concise sentences enough, </p><p>for I felt horribly weak; and when it was finished </p><p>he reverted at once to the topic of Natural History </p><p>and his own biological studies. He began to ques- </p><p>tion me closely about Tottenham Court Road and </p><p>Gower Street. “Is Caplatzi still flourishing ? What </p><p>a shop that was!” He had evidently been a very </p><p>ordinary medical student, and drifted incontinently </p><p>to the topic of the music halls. He told me some </p><p>anecdotes. “Left it all,” he said, “ten years ago. </p><p>How jolly it all used to be! But I made a young ass </p><p>of myself,—played myself out before I was twenty- </p><p>one. I daresay it’s all different now. But I must </p><p>look up that ass of a cook, and see what he's done </p><p>to your mutton.” </p><p> The growling overhead was renewed, so suddenly</p><p>and with so much savage anger that it startled, me. </p><p>“What’s that?” I called after him, but the door had </p><p>closed. He came back again with the boiled mut- </p><p>ton, and I was so excited by the appetising smell of </p><p>it that I forgot the noise of the beast that had </p><p>troubled me. </p><p> After a day of alternate sleep and feeding I was</p><p>so far recovered as to be able to get from my bunk </p><p>to the scuttle, and see the green seas trying to keep </p><p>pace with us. I judged the schooner was running </p><p>before the wind. Montgomery—that was the name </p><p>of the flaxen-haired man—came in again as I stood </p><p>there, and I asked him for some clothes. He lent me </p><p>some duck things of his own, for those I had worn </p><p>in the boat had been thrown overboard. They were </p><p>rather loose for me, for he was large and long in </p><p>his limbs. He told me casually that the captain was </p><p>three-parts drunk in his own cabin. As I assumed </p><p>the clothes, I "began asking him some questions </p><p>about the destination of the ship. He said the ship</p><p>was bound to Hawaii, but that it had to land him </p><p>first. </p><p> “Where?” said I.</p><p> “It’s an island, where I live. So far as I know, it</p><p>hasn’t got a name.” </p><p> He stared at me with his nether lip dropping, and</p><p>looked so wilfully stupid of a sudden that it came </p><p>into my head that he desired to avoid my questions. </p><p>I had the discretion to ask no more. </p><p>CHAPTER III. </p><p>The Strange Face </p><p>WE left the cabin and found a man at the </p><p>companion obstructing our way. He was </p><p>standing on the ladder with his back to us, </p><p>peering over the combing of the hatchway. He was, I </p><p>could see, a mishapen man, short, broad and clumsy, </p><p>with a crooked back, a hairy neck, and a head sunk </p><p>between his shoulders. He was dressed in dark- </p><p>blue serge, and had peculiarly thick, coarse, black </p><p>hair. I heard the unseen dogs growl furiously, and </p><p>forthwith he ducked back,—coming into contact </p><p>with the hand I put out to fend him off from </p><p>myself. He turned with animal swiftness. </p><p> In some indefinable way the black face thus flashed</p><p>upon me shocked me profoundly. It was a </p><p>singularly deformed one. The facial part projected, </p><p>forming something dimly suggestive of a muzzle, </p><p>and the huge half-open mouth showed as big white </p><p>teeth as I had ever seen in a human mouth. His </p><p>eyes were bloodshot at the edges, with scarcely a </p><p>rim of white round the hazel pupils. There was a </p><p>curious glow of excitement in his face. </p><p> “Confound you!” said Montgomery. “Why the</p><p>devil don’t you get out of the way?” </p><p> The black-faced man started aside without a</p><p>word. I went on up the companion, staring at him </p><p>instinctively as I did so. Montgomery stayed at </p><p>the foot for a moment. “You have no business </p><p>here, you know,” he said in a deliberate tone. “Your </p><p>place is forward.” </p><p> The black-faced man cowered. “They—won’t</p><p>have me forward.” He spoke slowly, with a queer, </p><p>hoarse quality in his voice. </p><p> “Won’t have you forward!” said Montgomery, in</p><p>a menacing voice. “But I tell you to go!” He was</p><p>on the brink of saying something further, then </p><p>looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the </p><p>ladder. </p><p> I had paused half way through the hatchway,</p><p>looking back, still astonished beyond measure at </p><p>the grotesque ugliness of this black-faced creature. </p><p>I had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordi- </p><p>nary face before, and yet—if the contradiction is </p><p>credible—I experienced at the same time an odd </p><p>feeling that in some way I had already encountered </p><p>exactly the features and gestures that now amazed </p><p>me. Afterwards it occurred to me that probably I </p><p>had seen him as I was lifted aboard; and yet that </p><p>scarcely satisfied my suspicion of a previous ac- </p><p>quaintance. Yet how one could have set eyes on so </p><p>singular a face and yet have forgotten the precise </p><p>occasion, passed my imagination. </p><p> Montgomery’s movement to follow me released my</p><p>attention, and I turned and looked about me at the </p><p>flush deck of the little schooner. I was already half </p><p>prepared by the sounds I had heard for what I </p><p>saw. Certainly I never beheld a deck so dirty. It </p><p>was littered with scraps of carrot, shreds of green </p><p>stuff, and indescribable filth. Fastened by chains </p><p>to the mainmast were a number of grisly stag- </p><p>hounds, who now began leaping and barking at me, </p><p>and by the mizzen a huge puma was cramped in a </p><p>little iron cage far too small even to give it turn- </p><p>ing room. Farther under the starboard bulwark </p><p>were some big hutches containing a number of </p><p>rabbits, and a solitary llama was squeezed in a </p><p>mere box of a cage forward. The dogs were muz- </p><p>zled by leather straps. The only human being on </p><p>deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at the wheel. </p><p> The patched and dirty lower sails were tense in</p><p>the wind, and up aloft the little ship seemed carry- </p><p>ing every sail she had. The sky was clear, the sun </p><p>midway down the western sky; long waves, capped </p><p>640 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>by the breeze with froth, were running with us. </p><p>We went past the steersman to the taffrail, and saw </p><p>the water come foaming under the stern and the </p><p>bubbles go dancing and vanishing in her wake. I </p><p>turned and surveyed the unsavoury length of the </p><p>ship. </p><p> “Is this an ocean menagerie?” said I.</p><p> “Looks like it,” said Montgomery.</p><p> “What are these beasts for? Merchandise,</p><p>curios? Does the captain think he is going to sell </p><p>them somewhere in the South Seas?” </p><p> “It looks like it, doesn’t it?” said Montgomery,</p><p>and turned towards the wake again. </p><p> Suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious</p><p>blasphemy from the companion hatchway, and the </p><p>deformed man with the black face came up hur- </p><p>riedly. He was immediately followed by a heavy </p><p>red-haired man in a white cap. At the sight of the </p><p>former the staghounds, who had all tired of barking </p><p>at me by this time, became furiously excited, howl- </p><p>ing and leaping against their chains. The black </p><p>hesitated before them, and this gave the red-haired </p><p>man time to come up with him and deliver a tre- </p><p>mendous blow between the shoulder-blades. The </p><p>poor devil went down like a felled ox, and rolled in </p><p>the dirt among the furiously excited dogs. It was </p><p>lucky for him that they were muzzled. The red- </p><p>haired man gave a yawp of exultation and stood </p><p>staggering, and as it seemed to me in serious </p><p>danger of either going backwards down the com- </p><p>panion hatchway or forward upon his victim. </p><p> So soon as the second man had appeared, Mont-</p><p>gomery had started forward. “Steady on there!” he </p><p>cried, in a tone of remonstrance. A couple of sail- </p><p>ors appeared on the forecastle. The black-faced </p><p>man, howling in a singular voice, rolled about under </p><p>the feet of the dogs. No one attempted to help him. </p><p>The brutes did their best to worry him, butting their </p><p>muzzles at him. There was a quick dance of their </p><p>lithe grey-figured bodies, over the clumsy prostrate </p><p>figure. The sailors forward shouted, as though </p><p>it was admirable sport. Montgomery g&amp;ve an </p><p>angry exclamation, and went striding down the </p><p>deck, and I followed him. The black-faced man </p><p>scrambled up and staggered forward, going and </p><p>leaning over the bulwark by the main shrouds, </p><p>where he remained, panting and glaring over his </p><p>shoulder at the dogs. The red-haired man laughed </p><p>a satisfied laugh.</p><p> “Look here, Captain,” said Montgomery, with</p><p>bis lisp a little accentuated, gripping the elbows </p><p>of the red-haired man, “this won’t do!” </p><p> I stood behind Montgomery. The captain came</p><p>half round, and regarded him with the dull and </p><p>solemn eyes of a drunken man. “Wha’ won’t do?” </p><p>he said, and added, after looking sleepily into </p><p>Montgomery’s face for a minute, “Blasted Saw- </p><p>bones!” </p><p> With a sudden movement he shook his arm free,</p><p>and after two ineffectual attempts stuck his freckled </p><p>fists into his side pockets. </p><p> “That man’s a passenger,” said Montgomery.</p><p>“I’d advise you to keep your hands off him.” </p><p> “Go to hell!” said the eaptain, loudly. He sud-</p><p>denly turned and staggered towards the side. “Do </p><p>what I like on my own ship,” he said. </p><p> I think Montgomery might have left him then,</p><p>seeing the brute was drunk; but he only turned a </p><p>shade paler, and followed the captain to the bul- </p><p>warks. </p><p> “Look you here, Captain,” he said; “that man of</p><p>mine is not to be ill-treated. He has been hazed </p><p>ever since he came aboard.” </p><p> For a minute, alcoholic fumes kept the captain</p><p>speechless. “Blasted Sawbones!” was all he con- </p><p>sidered necessary. </p><p> I could see that Montgomery had one of those</p><p>slow, pertinacious tempers that will warm day </p><p>after day to a white heat, and never again cool to </p><p>forgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had </p><p>been some time growing. “The man’s drunk,” said </p><p>I,	perhaps officiously; “you’ll do no good.”</p><p>Montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping </p><p>lip. “He’s always drunk. Do you think that ex- </p><p>cuses his assaulting his passengers?” </p><p> “My ship,” began the captain, waving his hand</p><p>unsteadily towards the cages, “was a clean ship. </p><p>Look at it now!” It was certainly anything but </p><p>clean. “Crew,” continued the captain, “clean, </p><p>respectable crew.” </p><p> “You agreed to take the beasts.”</p><p> “I wish I’d never set eyes on your infernal island.</p><p>What the devil—want beasts for on an island like</p><p>that? Then, that man of yours—understood he was </p><p>a man. He’s a lunatic; and he hadn’t no business </p><p>aft. Do you think the whole damned ship belongs </p><p>to you?” </p><p> ‘Tour sailors began to haze the poor devil as</p><p>soon as he came aboard.” </p><p> “That’s just what he is—he’s a devil! an ugly*</p><p>devil! My men can’t stand him. I can’t stand him. </p><p>None of us can’s stand him. Nor you either!” </p><p>Montgomery turned away. “You leave that man </p><p>alone, anyhow,” he said, nodding his head as he </p><p>spoke. </p><p> But the captain meant to quarrel now. He raised</p><p>his voice. “If he comes this end of the ship again </p><p>I’ll cut his insides out, I tell you. Cut out his </p><p>blasted insides! Who are you, to tell me what I’m </p><p>to do? I tell you I’m captain of this ship,—captain </p><p>and owner. I’m the law here, I tell you,—the law </p><p>and the prophets. I bargained to take a man and </p><p>his attendant to and from Arica, and bring back </p><p>some animals. I never bargained to carry a mad </p><p>devil and a silly Sawbones, a—” </p><p> Well, never mind what he called Montgomery. I</p><p>saw the latter take a step forward, and interposed. </p><p>“He’s drunk,” said I. The captain began some </p><p>abuse even fouler that the last. “Shut up!” I said, </p><p>turning on him sharply, for I had seen danger in </p><p>Montgomery’s white face. With that I brought the </p><p>downpour on myself. </p><p> However, I was glad to avert what was uncom-</p><p>monly near a scuffle, even at the price of the </p><p>captain’s drunken ill-will. I do not think I have </p><p>ever heard quite so much vile language come in a </p><p>continuous stream from any man’s Kps before, </p><p>though I have frequented eccentric company enough. </p><p>I found some of it hard to endure, though I am a </p><p>mild-tempered man; but, certainly, when I told the </p><p>captain to “shut up” I had forgotten that I was </p><p>merely a bit of human flotsam, cut off from my </p><p>resources and with my fare unpaid; a mere casual </p><p>dependant on the bounty, or speculative enterprise, </p><p>of the ship. He reminded me of it with consider- </p><p>able vigour; but at any rate I prevented a fight. </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>641 </p><p>CHAPTER IV. </p><p>At the Schooner’s Rail </p><p>TIAT night land was sighted after sundown, </p><p>and the schooner hove to. Montgomery inti- </p><p>mated that was his destination. It was too </p><p>far to see any details; it seemed to me then simply </p><p>a low-lying batch of dim blue in the uncertain blue- </p><p>grey sea. An almost vertical streak of smoke went </p><p>up from it into the sky. The captain was not on deck </p><p>when it was sighted. After he had vented his wrath </p><p>on me he had staggered below, and I understand he </p><p>went to sleep on the floor of his own cabin. The </p><p>mate practically assumed the command. He was the </p><p>gaunt, taciturn individual we had seen at the wheel. </p><p>Apparently he was in an evil temper with Mont- </p><p>gomery. He took not the slightest notice of either </p><p>of us. We dined with him in a sulky silence, after </p><p>a few ineffectual efforts on my part to talk. It </p><p>struck me too that the men regarded my companion </p><p>and his animals in a singularly unfriendly man- </p><p>ner. I found Montgomery very reticent about his </p><p>purpose with these creatures, and about his des- </p><p>tination; and though I was sensible of a growing </p><p>curiosity as to both, I did not press him. </p><p> We remained talking on the quarter deck until</p><p>the sky was thick with stars. Except for an occa- </p><p>sional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle and a move- </p><p>ment of the animals now and then, the night was </p><p>very still. The puma lay crouched together, watch- </p><p>ing us with shining eyes, a black heap in the corner </p><p>of its cage. Montgomery produced some cigars. </p><p>He talked to me of London in a tone of half-painful </p><p>reminiscence, asking all kinds of questions about </p><p>changes that had taken place. He spoke like a man </p><p>who had loved his life there, and had been suddenly </p><p>and irrevocably cut off from it. I gossiped as well </p><p>as I could of this and that. All the time the strange- </p><p>ness of him was shaping itself in my mind; and as </p><p>I talked I pgered at his odd, pallid face in the dim </p><p>light of the binnacle lantern behind me. Then I </p><p>looked out at the darkling sea, where in the dim- </p><p>ness his little island was hidden. </p><p> This man, it seemed to me, had come out of Im-</p><p>mensity merely to save my life. To-morrow he </p><p>would drop over the side, and vanish again out of </p><p>my existence. Even had it been under common- </p><p>place circumstances, it would have made me a trifle </p><p>thoughtful; but in the first place was the singularity </p><p>of an educated man living on this unknown little </p><p>island, and coupled with that the extraordinary na- </p><p>ture of his luggage. I found myself repeating the</p><p>captain’s question, What did he want with the </p><p>beasts? Why, too, had he pretended they were not </p><p>his when I had remarked about them at first? Then, </p><p>again, in his personal attendant there was a bizarre </p><p>quality which had impressed me profoundly. These </p><p>circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the </p><p>man. They laid hold of my imagination, and ham- </p><p>pered my tongue. </p><p> Towards midnight our talk of London died away,</p><p>and we stood side by side leaning over the bul- </p><p>warks and staring dreamily over the silent, starlit </p><p>sea, each pursuing his own thoughts. It was the </p><p>atmosphere for sentiment, and I began upon my </p><p>gratitude. </p><p> "If I may say it,” said I, after a time, "you have</p><p>saved my life.” </p><p> “Chance,” he answered. “Just chance.”</p><p> “I prefer to make my thanks to the accessible</p><p>agent.” </p><p> “Thank no one. You had the need, and I had the</p><p>knowledge; and I injected and fed you much as I </p><p>might have collected a specimen. I was bored, and </p><p>wanted something to do. If I’d been jaded that day, </p><p>or hadn’t liked your face, well—it’s a curious ques- </p><p>tion where you would have been now!” </p><p> This damped my mood a little. “At any rate,” I</p><p>began. </p><p> “It’s a chance, I tell you,” he interrupted,—“as</p><p>everything is in a man’s life. Only the asses won’t </p><p>see it! ^ Why am I here now, an outcast from civili- </p><p>sation, instead of being a happy man enjoying all the </p><p>pleasures of London? Simply because eleven years </p><p>ago—I lost my head for ten minutes on a foggy, </p><p>night.” </p><p> He stopped. “Yes?” said I.</p><p>“That’s all.” </p><p> We relapsed into silence. Presently he laughed.</p><p>“There’s something in this starlight that loosens </p><p>one’s tongue. I’m an gss, and yet somehow I would </p><p>like to tell you.” </p><p> ‘"Whatever you tell me, you may rely upon my</p><p>keeping to myself—if that’s it.” </p><p> He was on the point of beginning, and then shook</p><p>his head, doubtfully. </p><p> “Don’t,” said I. “It is all the same to me. After*</p><p>all, it is better to keep your secret. There’s noth- </p><p>ing gained but a little relief if I respect your con- </p><p>fidence. If I don’t—well?” </p><p> He grunted undecidedly. I felt I had him at a</p><p>disadvantage, had caught him in the mood of in- </p><p>discretion; and to tell the truth I was not curious </p><p>to learn what might have driven a young medical </p><p>student out of London. I have an imagination. I </p><p>shrugged my shoulders and turned away. Over the </p><p>taffrail leant a silent black figure, watching the </p><p>stars. It was Montgomery’s strange attendant. It </p><p>looked over its shoulder quickly with my movement, </p><p>then looked away again. </p><p> It may seem a little thing to you, perhaps, but it</p><p>came like a sudden blow to me. The only light </p><p>near us was a lantern at the wheel. The creature’s </p><p>face was turned for one brief instant out of the </p><p>dimness of the stern towards this illumination, and </p><p>I saw that the eyes that glanced at me shone with a </p><p>pale-green light. I did not know then that a red- </p><p>dish luminosity, at least, is not uncommon in hu- </p><p>man^ eyes. The thing came to me as stark inhu- </p><p>manity. That black figure with its eyes of fire </p><p>struck down through all my adult thoughts and feel- </p><p>ings, and for a moment the forgotten horrors of </p><p>childhood came back to ray mind. Then the effect </p><p>passed as it had come. An uncouth black figure </p><p>of a man, a figure of no particular import, hung over </p><p>the taffrail against the starlight, and I found Mont- </p><p>gomery was speaking to me. </p><p> “I’m thinking of turning in, then,” said he, “if</p><p>you’ve had enough of this.” </p><p> I answered him incongruously. We went below,</p><p>and he wished me good-night at the door of my </p><p>cabin. </p><p> That night I had some very unpleasant dreams.</p><p>The waning moon rose late. Its light struck a </p><p>ghostly white beam across my cabin, and made an </p><p>ominous shape on the planking by my bunk. Then </p><p>642 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>the staghounds woke, and began howling and bay- </p><p>ing; so that I dreamt fitfully, and scarcely slept until </p><p>the approach of dawn. </p><p>CHAPTER V. </p><p>The Man Who Had Nowhere to Go </p><p>IN the early morning (it was the second morn- </p><p>ing after my recovery, and I believe the fourth </p><p>after I was picked up), I awoke through an </p><p>avenue of tumultuous dreams,—dreams of guns and </p><p>howling mobs,—and became sensible of a hoarse </p><p>shouting above me. I rubbed my eyes and lay lis- </p><p>tening to the noise, doubtful for a little while of my </p><p>whereabouts. Then came a sudden pattering of bare </p><p>feet, the sound of heavy objects being thrown about, </p><p>a violent creaking and the rattling of chains. I </p><p>heard the swish of the water as the ship was sud- </p><p>denly brought round, and a foamy yellow-green </p><p>wave flew across the little round window and left </p><p>it streaming. I jumped into my clothes and went </p><p>on deck. </p><p> As I came up the ladder I saw against the flushed</p><p>sky—for the sun was just rising—the broad back </p><p>and red hair of the captain, and over his shoulder </p><p>the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on to the </p><p>mizzen spanker-boom. </p><p> The poor brute seemed horribly scared, and</p><p>crouched in the bottom of its little cage. </p><p> '‘Overboard with ’em!” bawled the captain.</p><p>“Ovei'board with ’em! We’ll have a clean ship soon </p><p>of the whole bilin’ of ’em.” </p><p> He stood in my way, so that I had perforce to</p><p>tap his shoulder to come on deck. He came round </p><p>with a start, and staggered back a few paces to </p><p>stare at me. It needed no expert eye to tell that </p><p>the man was still drunk. </p><p> “Hullo!” said he, stupidly; and then with a</p><p>light coming into his eyes, “Why, it’s Mister—? </p><p>Mister?” </p><p> “Prendick,” said I.</p><p> “Prendick be damned!” said he. “Shut-up,^</p><p>that’s your name. Mister Shut-up.” </p><p> It was no good answering the brute; but I cer-</p><p>tainly did not expect his next move. He held out </p><p>his hand to the gangway by which Montgomery</p><p>stood talking to a massive grey-haired man in </p><p>dirty-blue flannels, who had apparently just come </p><p>aboard. </p><p> “That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up! that way!’</p><p>roared the captain. </p><p> Montgomery and his companion turned as he</p><p>spoke. </p><p> “What do you mean?” I said.</p><p> “That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up,—that’s what</p><p>I mean! Overboard, Mister Shut-up,—and sharp! </p><p>We’re cleaning the ship out,—cleaning the whole </p><p>blessed ship out; and overboard you go!” </p><p> I stared at him dumbfounded. Then it occurred to</p><p>me that it was exactly the thing I wanted. The </p><p>lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger with </p><p>this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over. </p><p>I turned towards Montgomery. </p><p> “Can’t have you,” said Montgomery’s companion,</p><p>concisely. </p><p> “You can’t have me!” said I, aghast. He had the</p><p>squarest and most resolute face I ever set eyes </p><p>upon. </p><p> “Look here,” I began, turning to the captain.</p><p> “Overboard!” said the captain. “This ship aint</p><p>for beasts and cannibals and worse than beasts, </p><p>any more. Overboard you go, Mister Shut-up. If </p><p>they can't have you, you goes overboard. But, any- </p><p>how, you go—with your friends. I’ve done with </p><p>this blessed island for evermore, amen! I've had </p><p>enough of it. </p><p> “But Montgomery,” I appealed.</p><p> He distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head</p><p>hopelessly at the grey-haired man beside him, to </p><p>indicate his powerlessness to help me. </p><p> “I’ll see to you, presently,” said the captain.</p><p> Then began a curious three-cornered altercation.</p><p>Alternately I appealed to one and another of the </p><p>three men,—first to the grey-haired man to let me </p><p>land, and then to the drunken captain to keep me </p><p>aboard. I even bawled entreaties to the sailors. </p><p>Montgomery said never a word, only shook his head. </p><p>“You’re going overboard, I tell you,” was the cap- </p><p>tain’s refrain. “Law be damned! I’m king here.” </p><p>At last I must confess my voice suddenly broke in </p><p>the middle of a vigorous threat. I felt a gust of</p><p>hysterica! petulance, and went aft and stared dis- </p><p>mally at nothing. </p><p> Meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the</p><p>task of unshipping the packages and caged animals. </p><p>A large launch, with two standing lugs, lay under </p><p>the lea of the schooner; and into this the strange </p><p>assortment of goods were swung. I did not then </p><p>see the hands from the island that were receiving </p><p>the packages, for the hull of the launch was hid- </p><p>den from me by the side of the schooner. Neither </p><p>Montgomery nor his companion took the slightest </p><p>notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting and </p><p>directing the four or five sailors who were unload- </p><p>ing the goods. The captain went forward interfer- </p><p>ing rather than assisting. I was alternately </p><p>despairful and desperate. Once or twice as I </p><p>stood waiting there for things to accomplish them- </p><p>selves, I could not resist an impulse to laugh at my </p><p>miserable quandry. I felt all the wretcheder for the </p><p>lack of a breakfast. Hunger and a lack of blood- </p><p>corpuscles take all the manhood from a man. I </p><p>perceived pretty clearly that I had not the stamina </p><p>either to resist what the captain chose to do to ex- </p><p>pel me, or to force myself upon Montgomery and his </p><p>companion. So I waited passively upon fate; and </p><p>the work of transferring Montgomery’s possessions </p><p>to the launch went on as if I did not exist. </p><p> Presently that work was finished, and then came</p><p>a struggle. I was hauled, resisting weakly enough, </p><p>to the gangway. Even then I noticed the oddness </p><p>of the brown faces of the men who were with Mont- </p><p>gomery in the launch; but the launch was now </p><p>fully laden, and was shoved off hastily. A broaden- </p><p>ing gap of green water appeared under me, and I </p><p>pushed back with all my strength to avoid falling </p><p>headlong. The hands in the launch shouted deris- </p><p>ively, and I heard Montgomery curse at them; and </p><p>then the captain, the mate, and one of the seamen </p><p>helping him, ran me aft towards the stern. </p><p> The dingey of the “Lady Vain” had been towing</p><p>behind; it was half full of water, had no oars, and </p><p>was quite unvictualled. I refused to go aboard her, </p><p>and flung myself full length on the deck. In the </p><p>end, they swung me into her by a rope (for they </p><p>had no stern ladder), and then they cut me adrift. </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU	643</p><p>I drifted slowly from the schooner. In a kind of </p><p>stupor I watched all hands take to the rigging, and </p><p>slowly but surely she came round to the wind; the </p><p>sails fluttered, and then bellied out as the wind </p><p>came into them. I stared at her weather-beaten side </p><p>heeling steeply towards me; and then she passed </p><p>out of my range of view. </p><p> I did not turn my head to follow her. At first I</p><p> could scarcely believe what had happened. I</p><p> crouched in the bottom of the dingey, stunned, and</p><p> staring blankly at the vacant, oily sea. Then I</p><p> realized that I was in that little hell of mine again,</p><p> now half swamped; and looking back over the gun-</p><p> wale, I saw the schooner standing away from me,</p><p> with the red-haired captain mocking at me over the</p><p> taffrail, and turning towards the island saw the</p><p> launch growing smaller as she aproached the</p><p> beach.</p><p> Abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear'</p><p> to me. I had no means of reaching the land unless</p><p> I should chance to drift there. I was still weak,</p><p> you must remember, from my exposure in the boat;</p><p>I was empty and very faint, or I should have had </p><p>more heart. But as it was I suddenly began to sob </p><p>and weep, as I had never done since I was a little </p><p>child. The tears ran down my face' In a passion </p><p>of despair I struck with my fists at the water in the </p><p>bottom of the boat, and kicked savagely at the </p><p>gunwale. I prayed aloud for God to let me die. </p><p>CHAPTER VI. </p><p>The Evil-Looking Boatmen </p><p>BUT the islanders, seeing that I was really </p><p>adrift, took pity on me. I drifted very slowly </p><p>to the eastward, approaching the island slant- </p><p>ingly; and presently I saw, with hysterical relief, </p><p>the launch come round and return towards me. She </p><p>was heavily laden, and I could make out as she drew </p><p>nearer Montgomery’s white-haired, broad-shouldered </p><p>companion sitting cramped up with the dogs and </p><p>several packing-cases in the stern sheets. This in- </p><p>dividual stared fixedly at me without moving or </p><p>speaking. The black-faced cripple was glaring at </p><p>me as fixedly in the bows near the puma. There </p><p>were three other men besides,—three strange brut- </p><p>ish-looking fellows, at whom the staghounds were </p><p>snarling savagely. Montgomery, who was steering, </p><p>brought the boat by me, and rising, caught and </p><p>fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me, for </p><p>there was no room aboard. </p><p> I had recovered from my hysterical phase by this</p><p> time, and answered his hail, as he approached,</p><p> bravely enough. I told him the dingey was nearly</p><p> swamped, and he reached me a piggin. I was jerked</p><p> back as the rope tightened between the boats. For</p><p> some time I was busy baling.</p><p> It was not until I had got the water under (for</p><p>the water in the dingey had been shipped; the boat </p><p>was perfectly sound) that I had leisure to look at </p><p>the people in the launch again. </p><p> The white-haired man I found was still regarding</p><p> me steadfastly, but with an expression as I now</p><p> fancied, of some perplexity. When my eyes met</p><p> his, he looked down at the staghound that sat be-</p><p> tween his knees. He was a powerfully-built man,</p><p> as I have said, with a fine forehead and rather heavy</p><p> features; but his eyes had that odd drooping of</p><p>the skin above the lids which often comes with </p><p>advancing years, and the fall of his heavy mouth </p><p>at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious </p><p>resolution. He talked to Montgomery in a tone too </p><p>low for me to hear. </p><p> From him my eyes travelled to his three men;</p><p>and a strange crew they were. I saw only their </p><p>faces, yet there was something in their faces — I </p><p>knew not what—that gave me a queer spasm "of </p><p>disgust. I looked steadily at them, and the im- </p><p>pression did not pass, though I failed to see what </p><p>had occasioned it. They seemed to me then to be </p><p>brown men; but their limbs were oddly swathed in </p><p>3ome thin, dirty, white stuff down even to the fin- </p><p>gers and feet: I have never seen men so wrapped </p><p>up before, and women so only in the East. They </p><p>wore turbans too, and thereunder peered out their </p><p>elfin faces at me,—faces with protruding lower-jaws </p><p>and bright eyes. They had lank black hair, almost </p><p>like horsehair, and seemed as they sat to exceed </p><p>in stature any race of men I have seen. The white- </p><p>haired man, who I knew was a good six feet in </p><p>height, sat a head below any one of the three. I </p><p>found afterwards that really none were taller than </p><p>myself; but their bodies were abnormally long, and </p><p>the thigh-part of the leg short and curiously twisted. </p><p>At any rate, they were an amazingly ugly gang, and </p><p>over the heads of them under the forward lug peered </p><p>the black face of the man whose eyes were luminous </p><p>in the dark. As I stared at them, they met my gaze; </p><p>and then first one and then another turned away </p><p>from my direct stare, and looked at me in an odd. </p><p>furtive manner. It occurred to me that I was per- </p><p>haps annoying them, and I turned my attention to </p><p>the island we were approaching. </p><p> It was low, and covered with thick vegetation,—?</p><p> chiefly a kind of palm, that was new to me. From</p><p> one point a thin white thread of vapour rose slant-</p><p> ingly to an immense height, and then frayed out</p><p> like a down feather. We were now within the em-</p><p> brace of a broad bay flanked on either hand by a</p><p> low promontory. The beach was of dull-grey sand,</p><p> and sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or</p><p> seventy feet above the sea-level, and irregularly set</p><p> with trees and undergrowth. Half way up was a</p><p> square enclosure of some greyish stone, which I</p><p> found subsequently was built partly of coral and</p><p> partly of pumiceous lava. Two thatched roofs</p><p> peeped from within this enclosure. A man stood</p><p> awaiting us at the water’s edge. I fancied while</p><p> we were still far off that I saw some other and very</p><p> grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into the bushes</p><p> upon the slope; but I saw nothing of these as we</p><p> drew nearer. This man was of a moderate size, and</p><p> with a black negroid face. He had a large, almost</p><p> lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long thin</p><p> feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face</p><p> thrust forward staring at us. He was dressed like</p><p> Montgomery and his white-haired companion, in jac-</p><p> ket and trousers of blue serge. As we came still</p><p> nearer, this individual began to run to and fro on</p><p> the beach, making the most grotesque movements.</p><p> At a word of command from Montgomery, the four</p><p>men in the launch sprang up, and with singularly </p><p>awkward gestures struck the lugs. Montgomery </p><p>steered us round and into a narrow little dock ex- </p><p>cavated in the beach. Then the man on the beach </p><p>hastened towards us. This dock, as I call it, was </p><p>644	AMAZING</p><p> really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of</p><p> tide to take the longboat. I heard the bows ground</p><p> in the sand, staved the dingey off the rudder of</p><p> the big boat with my piggin, and freeing the</p><p> painter, landed. The three muffled men, with the</p><p> clumiest movements, scrambled out upon the sand,</p><p> and forthwith set to landing the cargo, assisted by</p><p> the man on the beach. I was struck especially by</p><p> the curious movements of the legs of the three</p><p> swathed and bandaged boatmen, — not stiff they</p><p> were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as if</p><p> they were jointed in the wrong place. The dogs</p><p> were still snarling, and strained at their chains</p><p> after these men, as the white-haired man landed</p><p> with them. The three big fellows spoke to one</p><p> another in odd guttural tones, and the man who had</p><p> waited for us on the beach began chattering to them</p><p> excitedly—a foreign language, as I fancied—as they</p><p> laid hands on some bales piled near the stern.</p><p> Somewhere I had heard such a voice before, and I</p><p> could not think where. The white-haired man stood,</p><p> holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling orders</p><p> over their din. Montgomery, having unshipped the</p><p> rudder, landed likewise, and all set to work at un-</p><p> loading. I was too faint, what with my long fast</p><p> and the sun beating down on my bare head, to offer</p><p> any assistance.</p><p> Presently the white-haired man seemed to recol-</p><p>lect my presence, and came up to me. </p><p> “You look,” said he, “as though you had scarcely</p><p> breakfasted.” His little eyes were a brilliant "black</p><p> under his heavy brows. “I must apologize for that.</p><p> Now you are our guest, we must make you comfort-</p><p> able,—though you are uninvited, you know.” He</p><p> looked keenly into my face. “Montgomery says you</p><p> are an educated man, Mr. Prendick; says you know</p><p> something of science. May I ask what that sig-</p><p>nifies?”	, ^ ,</p><p> I told him I had spent some years at the Royal</p><p>College of Science, and had done some researches </p><p>in biology under Huxley. He raised his eyebrows </p><p>slightly at that. </p><p> “That alters the case a little, Mr. Prendick, ^he</p><p> said, with a trifle more respect in his manner. “As</p><p> it happens, we are biologists here. This is a biologi-</p><p> cal station—of a sort.” His eye rested on the men</p><p> in white who were busily hauling the puma, on rol-</p><p> lers, towards the walled yard. “I and Montgomery,</p><p> at least,” he added. Then, “When you will be able</p><p> to get away, I can’t say. We’re off the track to</p><p> anywhere. We see a ship once in a twelve-month</p><p> or so.”</p><p> He left me abruptly, and went up the beach past</p><p>this group, and I think entered the enclosure. The </p><p>other two men were with Montgomery, erecting a </p><p>pile of smaller packages on a low-wheeled truck. </p><p>The llama was still on the launch with the rabbit </p><p>hutches; the staghounds were still lashed to the </p><p>thwarts. The pile of things completed, all three </p><p>men laid hold of the truck and began shoving the </p><p>ton-weight or so upon it after the puma. Presently </p><p>Montgomery left them, and coming back to me held </p><p>out his hand. </p><p> “I’m glad,” said he, “for my own part. That cap-</p><p> tain was a silly ass. He’d have made things lively</p><p>for you.”	.</p><p> “It was you,” said I, “that saved me again.</p><p> “That depends. You’ll find this island an infer-</p><p>STORIES </p><p>nally rum plaee, I promise you. I’d watch my go- </p><p>ings carefully, if I were you. He—” He hesi- </p><p>tated, and seemed to alter his mind about what was </p><p>on his lips. "I wish you’d help me with these rab- </p><p>bits,” he said. </p><p> His procedure with the rabbits was singular. I</p><p>waded in with him, and helped him lug one of the </p><p>hutches ashore. No sooner was that done than he </p><p>opened the door of it, and tilting the thing on one </p><p>end turned its living contents out on the ground. </p><p>They fell in a struggling heap one on the top of the </p><p>other. He clapped his hads, and forthwith they went </p><p>off with that hopping run of theirs, fifteen or </p><p>twenty of them I should think, up the beach. </p><p> “Increase and multiply, my friends,” said Mont-</p><p> gomery. “Replenish the island. Hitherto we’ve</p><p> had a certain lack of meat here.”</p><p> As I watched them disappearing, the white-haired</p><p> man returned with a brandy-flask and some biscuits.</p><p> “Something to go on with, Prendick,” said he, in a</p><p> far more familiar tone than before. I made no ado,</p><p> but set to work on the biscuits at once, while the</p><p> white-haired man helped Montgomery to release</p><p> about a score more of the rabbits. Three big</p><p> hutches, however, went up to the house with the</p><p> puma. The brandy I did not touch, for I have been</p><p> an abstainer from my birth.</p><p>CHAPTER VII. </p><p>“The Locked Door”</p><p>THE reader will perhaps understand that at </p><p>first everything was so strange about me, and </p><p>my position was the outcome of such unex- </p><p>pected adventures, that I had no discernment of the </p><p>relative strangeness of this or that thing. I fol- </p><p>lowed the llama up the beach, and was overtaken by </p><p>Montgomery, who asked me not to enter the stone </p><p>enclosure. I noticed then that the puma in its cage </p><p>and the pile of packages had been placed outside the </p><p>entrance to this quadrangle. </p><p> I turned and saw that the launch had now been</p><p>unloaded, run out again, and was being beached, and </p><p>the white-haired man was walking towards us. He </p><p>addressed Montgomery. </p><p> “And now comes the problem of this uninvited</p><p>guest. What are we to do with him?” </p><p> “He knows something of science,” said Mont-</p><p>gomery. </p><p> “I’m itching to get to work again—with this new</p><p> stuff,” said the white-haired man, nodding towards</p><p> the enclosure. His eyes grew brighter.</p><p> “I daresay you are,” said Montgomery, in any-</p><p>thing but a cordial tone. </p><p> “We can’t send him over there, and we can’t</p><p>spare the time to build him a new shanty; and we </p><p>certainly can’t take him into our confidence just </p><p>yet.” </p><p> “I’m in your hands,” said I. I had no idea of what</p><p> he meant by “over there.”</p><p> “I’ve been thinking of the same things,” Mont-</p><p>gomery answered. “There’s my room with the' </p><p>outer door—■” </p><p> “That's it,” said the elder man, promptly, look-</p><p> ing at Montgomery; and all three of us went to-</p><p> wards the enclosure. “I'm sorry to make a mys-</p><p> tery, Mr. Prendick; but you’ll remember you’re</p><p> uninvited. Our little establishment here contains</p><p>[THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>645 </p><p> a secret or so, is a kind of Blue-Beard’s chamber, in</p><p> fact. Nothing very dreadful, really, to a sane man;</p><p> but just now, as we don’t know you—”</p><p> “Decidedly,” said I, “I should be a fool to take</p><p>offence at any want of confidence.” </p><p> He twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile,—</p><p>he was one of those saturnine people who smile </p><p>with the corners of the mouth down,—and bowed </p><p>his acknowledgment of my complaisance. The main </p><p>entrance to the enclosure we passed; it was a heavy </p><p>wooden gate, framed in iron and locked, with the </p><p>cargo of the launch piled outside it, and at the cor- </p><p>ner we came to a small doorway I had not previously </p><p>observed. The white-haired man produced a bundle </p><p>of keys from the pocket of his greasy blue jacket, </p><p>opened this door, and entered. His keys, and the </p><p>elaborate locking-up of the place even while it was </p><p>still under his eye, struck me as peculiar. I fol- </p><p>lowed him, and found myself in a small apartment, </p><p>plainly but not uncomfortably furnished, and with </p><p>its inner door, which was slightly ajar, opening into </p><p>a paved courtyard. This inner door Montgomery at </p><p>once closed. A hammock was slung across the </p><p>darker corner of the room, and a small unglazed win- </p><p>dow defended by an iron bar looked out towards </p><p>the sea. </p><p> This the white-haired man told me was to be my</p><p>apartment; and the inner door, which “for fear of </p><p>accidents,” he said, he would lock on the other side, </p><p>was my limit inward. He called my attention to </p><p>a convenient deck-chair before the window, and to an </p><p>array of old books,—chiefly, I found, surgical works </p><p>and editions of the Latin and Greek classics (lan- </p><p>guages I cannot read with any comfort), on a shelf </p><p>near the hammock. He left the room by the outer </p><p>door, as if to avoid opening the inner one again. </p><p> “We usually have our meals in here,” said Mont-</p><p>gomery, and then, as if in doubt, went out after </p><p>the other. “Moreau 1” I heard him call, and for the </p><p>moment I do not think I noticed. Then as I handled </p><p>the books on the shelf it came up in consciousness: </p><p>Where had I heard the rame of Moreau before? I </p><p>sat down before the window, took out the biscuits </p><p>that still remained to me, and ate them with an ex- </p><p>cellent appetite. Moreau 1 </p><p> Through the window I saw one of those unac-</p><p>countable men in white, lugging a packing-case along </p><p>the beach. Presently the window-frame hid him. </p><p>Then I heard a key inserted and turned in the lock </p><p>behind me. After a little while I heard through the</p><p>locked door the noise of the staghounds, that had </p><p>now been brought up from the beach. They were not </p><p>barking, but sniffing and growling in a curious fash- </p><p>ion. I could hear the rapid patter of their feet, and </p><p>Montgomery’s voice soothing them. </p><p> I was very much impressed by the elaborate</p><p>secrecy of these two men regarding the contents of </p><p>the place, and for some time I was thinking of that </p><p>and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name </p><p>of Moreau; but so odd is the human memory that I </p><p>could not then recall that well-known name in its </p><p>proper connection. From that my thoughts went to </p><p>the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on </p><p>the beach. I never saw such a gait, such odd mo- </p><p>tions as he pulled at the box. I recalled that none </p><p>of these men had spoken to me, though most of </p><p>them I had found looking at me at one time or </p><p>another in a peculiarly furtive manner, quite un- </p><p>like the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage. </p><p>Indeed, they had all seemed remarkably taciturn, </p><p>and when they did speak, endowed with very un- </p><p>canny voices. What was wrong with them? Then </p><p>I recalled the eyes of Montgomery’s ungainly </p><p>attendant. </p><p> Just as I was thinking of him he came in. He</p><p>was now dressed in white, and carried a little tray </p><p>with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon. I </p><p>could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came, </p><p>bending amiably, and placed the tray before me on </p><p>the table. Then astonishment paralyzed me. Under </p><p>his stringy black hair I saw his ear; it jumped upon </p><p>me suddenly close to my face. The man had pointed </p><p>ears, covered with a fine brown fur! </p><p> “Your breakfast, sair,” he said.</p><p> I stared at his face without attempting to an-</p><p>swer him. He turned and went towards the door, </p><p>regarding me oddly over his shoulder. I followed </p><p>him out with my eyes; and as I did so, by some </p><p>odd trick of unconscious cerebration, there came </p><p>surging into my head the phrase, “The Moreau </p><p>Hollows”—was it? “The Moreau—” Ah! It sent </p><p>my memory back ten years. “The Moreau Hoi'rors!” </p><p>The phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment, </p><p>and then I saw it in red lettering on a little buff- </p><p>coloured pamphlet, to read which made one shiver </p><p>and creep. Then I remembered distinctly all about </p><p>it. That long-forgotten pamphlet came back with </p><p>startling vividness to my mind. I had been a mere </p><p>lad then, and Moreau was, I suppose, about fifty,— </p><p>a prominent and masterful physiologist, well-knowrf </p><p>in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagina- </p><p>tion and his brutal directness in discusson. </p><p> Was this the same Moreau? He had published</p><p>some very astonishing facts in connection with the </p><p>transfusion of blood, and in addition was known </p><p>to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then </p><p>suddenly his career was closed. He had to leave </p><p>England. A journalist obtained access to his labor- </p><p>atory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with </p><p>the deliberate intention of making sensational ex- </p><p>posures; and by the help of a shocking accident (if </p><p>it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became </p><p>notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched </p><p>dog, flayed and otherwise mutilated, escaped from </p><p>Moreau's house. It was in the silly season, and a </p><p>prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary labora- </p><p>tory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the na- </p><p>tion. It was not the first time that conscience has </p><p>turned against the methods of research. The doc- </p><p>tor was simply howled out of the country. It may </p><p>be that he deserved to be; but I still think that the </p><p>tepid support of his fellow-investigators and his </p><p>desertion by the great body of scientific workers was </p><p>a shameful thing. Yet some of his experiments, </p><p>by the journalist’s account, were wantonly cruel. </p><p>He might perhaps have purchased his social peace </p><p>by abandoning his investigations; but he appar- </p><p>ently preferred the latter, as most men would who </p><p>have once fallen under the overmastering spell of </p><p>research. He was unmarried, and had indeed noth- </p><p>ing but his own interest to consider. </p><p> I felt convinced that this must be the same man.</p><p>Everything pointed to it. It dawned upon me to </p><p>what end the puma and the other animals—which </p><p>had now been brought with other luggage into the </p><p>enclosure behind the house—were destined; and a </p><p>646 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>curious faint odour, the halitus of something famil- </p><p>iar, an odour that had been in the background of </p><p>my consciousness hitherto, suddenly came forward </p><p>into the forefront of my thoughts. It was the anti- </p><p>septic odour of the dissecting-room. I heard the </p><p>puma growling through the wall, and one of the </p><p>dogs yelped as though it had been struck. </p><p> Yet surely, and especially to another scientific</p><p>man, there was nothing so horrible in vivisection </p><p>as to account for this secrecy; and by some odd </p><p>leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous </p><p>eyes of Montgomery’s attendant came back again </p><p>before me with the sharpest definition. I stared </p><p>before me out at the green sea, frothing under a </p><p>freshening breeze, and let these and other strange </p><p>memories of the last few days chase one another </p><p>through my mind. </p><p> What could it all mean ? A locked enclosure on a</p><p>lonely island, a notorious vivisector, and these crip- </p><p>pled and distorted men? </p><p>CHAPTER VIII. </p><p>The Crying of the Puma </p><p>MONTGOMERY interrupted my tangle of </p><p>mystification and suspicion about one </p><p>o’clock, and his grotesque attendant fol- </p><p>lowed him with a tray bearing bread, some herbs </p><p>and other eatables, a flask of whiskey, a jug of </p><p>water, and three glasses and knives. I glanced </p><p>askance at this strange creature, and found him </p><p>watching me with his queer, restless eyes. Mont- </p><p>gomery said he would lunch with me, but that' </p><p>Moreau was to preoccupied with some work to </p><p>come. </p><p> “Moreau!” said I. “I know that name.”</p><p> “The devil you do!” said he. “What an ass I</p><p>was to mention it to you! I might have thought. </p><p>Anyhow, it will give you an inkling of our—mys- </p><p>teries. Whiskey?” </p><p> “No, thanks; I’m an abstainer.”</p><p> “I wish I’d been. But it’s no use locking the door</p><p>after the steed is stolen. It was that infernal stuff </p><p>which led to my coming here,—that, and a foggy </p><p>night. I thought myself in luck at the time, when </p><p>Moreau offered to get me off. It’s queer—” </p><p> “Montgomery,” said I, suddenly, as the outer door</p><p>closed, “why has your man pointed ears?” </p><p> “Damn!” he said, over his first mouthful of food.</p><p>He stared at me for a moment, and then repeated, </p><p>“Pointed ears?” </p><p> “Little points to them,” said I, as calmly as pos-</p><p>sible, with a catch in my breath; “and a fine black </p><p>fur at the edges?” </p><p> He helped himself to whiskey and water with</p><p>great deliberation. “I was under the impression— </p><p>that his hair covered his ears.” </p><p> “I saw them as he stooped by me to put that</p><p>coffee you sent to me on the table. And his eyes </p><p>shine in the dark.” </p><p> By this time Montgomery had recovered from the</p><p>surprise of my question. “I always thought,” he </p><p>said deliberately, with a certain accentuation of his </p><p>flavouring of lisp, “that there was something the </p><p>matter with his ears, from the way he covered them. </p><p>What were they like?” </p><p> I was persuaded from his manner that this ignor-</p><p>ance was a pretense. Still, I could hardly tell the </p><p>man that I thought him a liar. “Pointed,” I said; </p><p>“rather small and furry,—distinctly furry. But the </p><p>whole man is one of the strangest beings I ever set </p><p>eyes on.” </p><p> A sharp, hoarse cry of animal pain came from the</p><p>enclosure behind us. Its depth and volume testified </p><p>to the puma. I saw Montgomery wince. </p><p> “Yes?” he said.</p><p> “Where did you pick up the creature ?”</p><p> “San Francisco. He’s an ugly brute, I admit.</p><p>Half-witted, you know. Can’t remember where he </p><p>came from. But I’m used to him, you know. We </p><p>both are. How does he strike you?” </p><p> “He’s unnatural,” I said. “There’s something</p><p>about him—don’t think me fanciful, but it gives </p><p>me a nasty little sensation, a tightening of my </p><p>muscles, when he comes near me. It’s a touch— </p><p>of the diabolical, in fact.” </p><p> Montgomery had stopped eating while I told him</p><p>this. “Rum!” he said. “7 can’t see it.” He re- </p><p>sumed his meal. “I had no idea of it,” he said, and </p><p>masticated. “The crew of the schooner must have </p><p>felt it the same. Made a dead set at the poor devil. </p><p>You saw the captain?”</p><p> Suddenly the puma howled again, this time more</p><p>painfully. Montgomery swore under his breath. I </p><p>had half a mind to attack him about the men on the </p><p>beach. Then the poor brute within gave vent to a </p><p>series of short, sharp cries.	i</p><p> “Your men on the beach,” said I; “what race are</p><p>they?” </p><p> “Excellent fellows, aren’t they?” said he, absent-</p><p>mindedly, knitting his brows as the animal yelled </p><p>out sharply. </p><p> I said no more. There was another outcry worse</p><p>than the former. He looked at me with his dull </p><p>grey eyes, and then took some more whiskey. He </p><p>tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol, </p><p>professing to have saved my life with it. He seemed </p><p>anxious to lay stress on the fact that I owed my life </p><p>to him. I answered him distractedly. </p><p> Presently our meal came to an end; the misshapen</p><p>monster with the pointed ears cleared the remains </p><p>away, and Montgomery left me alone in the room </p><p>again. All the time he had been in a state of ill- </p><p>concealed irritation at the noise of the vivisected </p><p>puma. He had spoken of his odd want of nerve, and </p><p>left me to the obvious application. </p><p> I found myself that the cries were singularly irri-</p><p>tating, and they grew in depth and intensity as the </p><p>afternoon wore on. They were painful at first, but </p><p>their constant resurgence at last altogether upset </p><p>my balance. I flung aside a crib of Horace I had </p><p>been reading, and began to clench my fists, to bite </p><p>my lips, and to pace the room. Presently I got to </p><p>stopping my ears with my fingers. </p><p> The emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me</p><p>steadily, grew at last to such an exquisite expres- </p><p>sion of suffering that I could stand it in that con- </p><p>fined room no longer. I stepped out of the door into </p><p>the slumberous heat of the late afternoon, and walk- </p><p>ing past the main entrance—locked again, I noticed </p><p>•—turned the corner of the wall. </p><p> The crying sounded even louder out of doors. It</p><p>was as if all the pain in the world had found a </p><p>voice. Yet had I known such pain was in the next </p><p>room, and had it been dumb, I believe — I have </p><p>thought since—I could have stood it well enough. </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>647 </p><p>It is when suffering finds a voice and sets our nerves </p><p>quivering that this pity comes troubling us. But </p><p>in spite of the brilliant sunlight and the green fans </p><p>of the trees waving in the soothing sea-breeze, the </p><p>world was a confusion, blurred with drifting black </p><p>and red phantasms, until'I was out of earshot of the </p><p>house in the chequered wall. </p><p>CHAPTER IX. </p><p>The Thing in the Forest </p><p>I STRODE through the undergrowth that clothed </p><p>the ridge behind the house, scarcely heeding </p><p>whither I went; passed on through the shadow </p><p>of a thick cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond </p><p>it, and so presently found myself some way on the </p><p>other side of the ridge, and descending towards a </p><p>streamlet that ran through '*a narrow valley. I </p><p>paused and listened. The distance I had come, or </p><p>the intervening masses of thicket, deadened any </p><p>sound that might be coming from the enclosure. </p><p>The air was still. Then with a rustle a rabbit </p><p>emerged, and went scampering up the slope before </p><p>me. I hesitated, and sat down in the edge of the </p><p>shade. </p><p> The place was a pleasant one. The rivulet was</p><p>hidden by the luxuriant vegetation of the banks </p><p>save at one point, where I caught a triangular patch </p><p>of its glittering water. On the farther side I saw </p><p>through a bluish haze a tangle of trees and creepers, </p><p>and above these again the luminous blue of the sky. </p><p>Here and there a splash of white or crimson marked </p><p>the blooming of some trailing epiphyte. I let my </p><p>eyes wander over this scene for a while, and then </p><p>began to turn over in my mind again the strange </p><p>peculiarities of Montgomery’s man. But it was </p><p>too hot to think elaborately, and presently I fell into </p><p>a tranquil state midway between dozing and waking. </p><p> From this I was aroused, after I know not how</p><p>long, by a rustling amidst the greenery on the other </p><p>side of the stream. For a moment I could see noth- </p><p>ing but the waving summits of the ferns and reeds. </p><p>Then suddenly upon the bank of the stream appeared </p><p>Something—at first I could not distinguish what it </p><p>was. It bowed its round head to the water, and be- </p><p>gan to drink. Then I saw it was a man, going on </p><p>all-fours like a beast. He was clothed in bluish </p><p>cloth, and was of a copper-coloured hue, with black </p><p>hair. It seemed that grotesque ugliness was an in- </p><p>variable character of these islanders. I could hear </p><p>the suck of the water at his lips as he drank. </p><p> I leant forward to see him better, and a piece of</p><p>lava, detached by my hand, went pattering down </p><p>the slope. He looked up guiltily, and his eyes met </p><p>mine. Forthwith he scrambled to his feet, and stood </p><p>wiping his clumsy hand across his mouth and re- </p><p>garding me. His legs were scarcely half the length </p><p>of his body. So, staring one another out of coun- </p><p>tenance, we remained for perhaps the space of a </p><p>minute. Then, stopping to look back once or twice, </p><p>he slunk off among the bushes to the right of me, </p><p>and I heard the swish of the fronds grow faint in </p><p>the distance and die away. Long after he had dis- </p><p>appeared, I remained sitting up staring in the direc- </p><p>tion of his retreat. My drowsy tranquility had </p><p>gone. </p><p> I was startled by a noise behind me, and turning</p><p>suddenly saw the flapping white tail of a rabbit </p><p>vanishing up the slope. I jumped to my feet. The </p><p>apparition of this grotesque, half-bestial creature </p><p>had suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon </p><p>for me. I looked around me rather nervously, and </p><p>regretted that I was unarmed. Then I thought </p><p>that the man I had just seen had been clothed in </p><p>bluish cloth, had not been naked as a savage would </p><p>have been; and I tried to persuade myself from </p><p>that fact that he was after all probably a peaceful </p><p>character, that the dull ferocity of his countenance </p><p>belied him. </p><p> Yet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition.</p><p>I walked to the left along the slope, turning my </p><p>head about, and peering this way and that among </p><p>the straight stems of the trees. Why should a man </p><p>go on all-fours and drink with his lips? Presently </p><p>I heard an animal wailing again, and taking it to </p><p>be the puma, I turned about and walked in a direc- </p><p>tion diametrically opposite to the sound. This led </p><p>me down to the stream, across which I stepped and </p><p>pushed my way up through the undergrowth be- </p><p>yond. </p><p> I was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet</p><p>on the ground, and going up to it found it to be a </p><p>peculiar fungus, branched and corrugated like a </p><p>foliaceous lichen, but deliquescing into slime at the </p><p>touch; and then in the shadow of some luxuriant </p><p>ferns I came upon an unpleasant thing,—the dead </p><p>body of a rabbit covered with shining flies, but still </p><p>warm and with the head torn off. I stopped aghast </p><p>at the sight of the scattered blood. Here at least </p><p>was one visitor to the island disposed of! There </p><p>were no traces of other violence about it. It looked </p><p>as though it had been suddenly snatched up and </p><p>killed; and as I stared at the little furry body came </p><p>the difficulty of how the thing had been done. The </p><p>vague dread that had been in my mind since I had</p><p>seen the inhuman face of the man at the stream </p><p>grew distincter as I stood there. I began to realise </p><p>the hardihood of my expedition among these un- </p><p>known people. The thicket about me became altered </p><p>to my imagination. Every shadow became some- </p><p>thing more than a shadow,—became an ambush; </p><p>every rustle became a threat. Invisible things </p><p>seemed watching me. I resolved to go back to the </p><p>enclosure on the beach. I suddenly turned away </p><p>and thrust myself violently, possibly even franti- </p><p>cally, through the bushes, anxious to get a clear </p><p>space about me again. </p><p> I stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging</p><p>upon an open space. It was a kind of glade in the </p><p>forest, made by a fall; seedlings were already start- </p><p>ing up to struggle for the vacant space; and beyond, </p><p>the dense growth of stems and twining vines and </p><p>splashes of fungus and flowers closed in again. Be- </p><p>fore me, squatting together upon the fungoid ruins </p><p>of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my ap- </p><p>proach, were three grotesque human figures. One </p><p>was evidently a female; the other two were men. </p><p>They were naked, save for swathings of scarlet cloth </p><p>about the middle; and their skins were of a dull </p><p>pinkish drab colour, such as I had seen in no savages </p><p>before. They had fat, heavy, chinless faces, re- </p><p>treating foreheads, and a scant bristly hair upon </p><p>their heads. I never saw such bestial-looking crea- </p><p>tures. </p><p> They were talking, or at least one of the men</p><p>was talking to the other two, and all three had been </p><p>648 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>too closely interested to heed the rustling of my </p><p>approach. They swayed their heads and shoulders </p><p>from side to side. The speaker’s words came thick </p><p>and sloppy, and though I could hear them distinctly </p><p>I could not distinguish what he said. He seemed to </p><p>me to be reciting some complicated gibberish. Pres- </p><p>ently his articulation became shriller, and spread- </p><p>ing his hands he rose to his feet. At that the </p><p>others began to gibber in unison, also rising to their </p><p>feet, spreading their hands and swaying their </p><p>bodies in rhythm with their chant. I noticed then </p><p>the abnormal shortness of their legs, and their lank, </p><p>clumsy feet. All three began slowly to circle round, </p><p>raising and stamping their feet and waving their </p><p>arms; a kind of tune crept into their rhythmic re- </p><p>citation, and a refrain,—“Aloola,” or “Balloola,” it </p><p>sounded like. Their eyes began to sparkle, and </p><p>their ugly faces to brighten, with an expression </p><p>of strange pleasure. Saliva dripped from their </p><p>lipless mouths. </p><p> Suddenly, as I watched their grotesque and unac-</p><p>countable gestures, I perceived clearly for the first </p><p>time what it was that had offended me, what had </p><p>given me the two inconsistent and conflicting im- </p><p>pressions of utter strangeness and yet of the </p><p>strangest familiarity. The three creatures engaged </p><p>in this mysterious rite were human in shape, and </p><p>yet human beings with the strangest air about </p><p>them of some familiar animal. Each of these crea- </p><p>tures, despite its human form, its rag of clothing, </p><p>and the rough humanity of its bodily form, had </p><p>woven into it—into its movements, into the ex- </p><p>pression of its countenance, into its whole presence </p><p>—some now irresistible suggestion of a hog, a </p><p>swinish taint, the unmistakable mark of the beast. </p><p> I stood overcome by this amazing realisation; and</p><p>then the most horrible questionings came rushing </p><p>into my mind. They began leaping in the air, first </p><p>one and then the other, whooping and grunting. </p><p>Then one slipped, and for a moment was on all- </p><p>fours,—to recover, indeed, forthwith. But that </p><p>transitory gleam of the true animalism of these </p><p>monsters was enough. </p><p> I turned as noiselessly as possible, and becoming</p><p>every now and then rigid with the fear of being </p><p>discovered, as a branch cracked or a leaf rustled, </p><p>I pushed back into the bushes. It was long before </p><p>I grew bolder, and dared to move freely. My only </p><p>idea for the moment was to get away from these </p><p>foul beings, and I scarcely noticed that I had </p><p>emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees. </p><p>Then suddenly traversing a little glade, I saw with</p><p>an unpleasant start two clumsy legs among the </p><p>trees, walking with noiseless footsteps parallel with </p><p>my course, and perhaps thirty yards away from me. </p><p>The head and upper part of the body were hidden </p><p>by a tangle of creeper. I stopped abruptly, hoping </p><p>the creature did not see me. The feet stopped as I </p><p>did. So nervous was I that I controlled an impulse </p><p>to headlong flight with the utmost difficulty. Then </p><p>looking hard, I distinguished through the inter- </p><p>lacing network the head and body of the brute I had </p><p>seen drinking. He moved his head. There was an </p><p>emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me from </p><p>the shadow of the trees, a half-luminous colour that </p><p>In another moment he had vanished behind some </p><p>bushes. I could not see him, but I felt that he had </p><p>stopped and was watching me again. </p><p> What on earth was he,—man or beast? What did</p><p>he want with me? I had no weapon, not even a </p><p>stick. Fight would be madness. At any rate the </p><p>Thing, whatever it was, lacked the courage to attack </p><p>me. Setting my teeth hard, I walked straight to- </p><p>wards him. I was anxious not to show the fear that </p><p>seemed chilling my backbone. I pushed through a </p><p>tangle of tall white-flowered bushes, and saw him </p><p>twenty paces beyond, looking over his shoulder at </p><p>me and hesitating. I advanced a step or two, look- </p><p>ing steadfastly into his eyes. </p><p> “Who are you?” said I.</p><p> He tried to meet my gaze. “No!" he s'aid sud-</p><p>denly, and turning went bounding away from me </p><p>through the undergrowth. Then he turned and </p><p>stared at me again. His eyes shone brightly out </p><p>of the dusk under the trees. </p><p> My heart was in my mouth; but I felt my only</p><p>chance was bluff, and walked steadily towards him. </p><p>He turned again and vanished into the dusk. Oncei </p><p>more I thought I caught the glint of his eyes, and </p><p>that was all. </p><p> For the first time I realised how the lateness of</p><p>the hour might affect me. The sun had set some </p><p>minutes since, the swift dusk of the tropics was al- </p><p>ready fading out of the eastern sky, and a pioneer </p><p>moth fluttered silently by my head. Unless I would </p><p>spend the night among the unknown dangers of the </p><p>mysterious forest, I must hasten back to the en- </p><p>closure. The thought of a return to that pain- </p><p>haunted refuge was extremely disagreeable, but still </p><p>more so was the idea of being overtaken in the open </p><p>by darkness and all that darkness might conceal. </p><p>I gave one more look into the blue shadows that had </p><p>swallowed up this odd creature, and then retraced </p><p>my way down the slope towards the stream, going</p><p>as I judged in the direction from which I had come. </p><p> I walked eagerly, my mind confused with many</p><p>things, and presently found myself in a level place </p><p>among scattered trees. The colourless clearness </p><p>that comes after the sunset flush was darkling; the </p><p>blue sky above grew momentarily deeper, and the </p><p>little stars one by one pierced the attenuated light; </p><p>the interspaces of the trees, the gaps in the further </p><p>vegetation, that had been hazy blue in the daylight, </p><p>grew black and mysterious. I pushed on. The </p><p>colour vanished from the world. The tree-tops rose </p><p>against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette, </p><p>and all below that outline melted into one formless </p><p>blackness. Presently the trees grew thinner, and </p><p>the shrubby undergrowth more abundant. Then </p><p>there was a desolate space covered with a white </p><p>sand, and then another expanse of tangled bushes. </p><p>I did not remember crossing the sand-opening be- </p><p>fore. I began to be tormented by a faint rustling </p><p>upon my right hand. I thought at first it was fancy, </p><p>for whenever I stopped there was silence, save for </p><p>the evening breeze in the tree-tops. Then when I </p><p>turned to hurry on again there was an echo to my </p><p>footsteps. </p><p> I turned away from the thickets, keeping to the</p><p>more open ground, and endeavouring by sudden </p><p>turns now and then to surprise something in the </p><p>act of creeping upon me. I saw nothing, and never* </p><p>vanished as he turned his head again. He was </p><p>motionless for a moment, and then with a noiseless </p><p>tread began running through the green confusion- theless my sense of another presence grew steadily- </p><p>THE ISLAND OF; DR. MOREAU </p><p>m </p><p>I increased my pace, and after some time came to </p><p>a slight ridge, crossed it, and turned sharply, re- </p><p>garding it steadfastly from the further side. It </p><p>came out black and clear-cut against the darkling </p><p>sky; and presently a shapeless lump heaved up mo- </p><p>mentarily against the sky-line and vanished again. </p><p>I felt assured now that my tawny-faced antagonist </p><p>was stalking me once more; and coupled with that </p><p>was another unpleasant realisation, that I had lost </p><p>my way. </p><p> For a time I hurried on hopelessly perplexed, and</p><p>pursued by that stealthy approach. Whatever it </p><p>was, the Thing either lacked the courage to attack </p><p>me, or it was waiting to take me at some disad- </p><p>vantage. I kept studiously to the open. At times </p><p>I would turn and listen; and presently I had half </p><p>persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned </p><p>the chase, or was a mere creation of my disordered </p><p>imagination. Then I heard the sound of the sea. I </p><p>quickened my footsteps almost into a run, and im- </p><p>mediately there was a stumble in my reai\ </p><p> I turned suddenly, and stared at the uncertain</p><p>trees behind me. One black shadow seemed to leap </p><p>into another. I listened, rigid, and heard nothing </p><p>but the creep of the blood in my ears. I thought </p><p>that my nerves were unstrung, and that my imagi- </p><p>nation was tricking me, and turned resolutely to- </p><p>wards the sound of the sea again. </p><p> In a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and</p><p>I emerged upon a bare, low headland running out </p><p>into the sombre water. The night was calm and </p><p>clear, and the reflection of the growing multitude of </p><p>the stars shivered in the tranquil heaving of the </p><p>sea. Some way out, the wash upon an irregular </p><p>band of reef shone with a pallid light of its own. </p><p>Westward I saw the zodiacal light mingling with the </p><p>yellow brilliance of the evening star. The coast fell </p><p>away from me to the east, and westward it was hid- </p><p>den by the shoulder of the cape. Then I recalled the </p><p>fact that Moreau’s beach lay to the west. </p><p> A twig snapped behind me, and there was a</p><p>rustle. I turned, and stood facing the dark trees. </p><p>I could see nothing—or else I could see too much. </p><p>Every dark form in the dimness had its ominous </p><p>quality, its peculiar suggestion of alert watchful- </p><p>ness. So I stood for perhaps a minute, and then, </p><p>with an eye to the trees still, turned westward to </p><p>cross the headland; and as I moved, one among the </p><p>lurking shadows moved to follow me. </p><p> My heart beat quickly. Presently the broad sweep</p><p>of a bay to the westward became visible, and I </p><p>halted again. The noiseless shadow halted a dozen </p><p>yards from me. A little point of light shone on the </p><p>further bend of the curve, and the grey sweep of </p><p>the sandy beach lay faint under the starlight. Per- </p><p>haps two miles away was that little point of light. </p><p>To get to the beach I should have to go through the </p><p>trees where the shadows lurked, and down a bushy </p><p>slope. </p><p> I could see the Thing rather more distinctly now.</p><p>It was no animal, for it stood erect. At that I </p><p>opened my mouth to speak, and found a hoarse </p><p>phlegm choked my voice. I tried again, and shouted, </p><p>“Who is there?” There was no answer. I ad- </p><p>vanced a step. The Thing did not move, only </p><p>gathered itself together. My foot struck a stone. </p><p>That gave me an idea. Without taking my eyes off </p><p>the black form before me, I stooped and picked up </p><p>this lump of rock; but at my motion the Thing </p><p>turned abruptly as a dog might have done, and slunk </p><p>obliquely into the further darkness. Then I re- </p><p>called a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, and </p><p>twisted the rock into my handkerchief, and gave </p><p>this a turn round my wrist. I heard a movement </p><p>further off among the shadows, as if the Thing was </p><p>in retreat. Then suddenly my tense excitement gave </p><p>way; I broke into a profuse perspiration and fell </p><p>a-trembling, with my adversary routed and this </p><p>weapon in my hand. </p><p> It was some time before I could summon resolu-</p><p>tion to go down through the trees and bushes upon </p><p>the flank of the headland to the beach. At last I did </p><p>it at a run; and as I emerged from the thicket upon </p><p>the sand, I heard some other body come crashing </p><p>after me. At that I completely lost my head with </p><p>fear, and began running along the sand. Forthwith </p><p>there came the swift patter of soft feet in pursuit. </p><p>I gave a wild cry, and redoubled my pace. Some </p><p>dim, black things about three or four times the size </p><p>of rabbits went running or hopping up from the </p><p>beach towards the bushes as I passed. </p><p> So long as I live, I shall remember the terror of</p><p>that chase. I ran near the water’s edge, and heard </p><p>every now and then the splash of the feet that </p><p>gained upon me. Far away, hopelessly far, was the </p><p>yellow light. All the night about us was black and </p><p>still. Splash, splash, came the pursuing feet, nearer </p><p>and nearer. I felt my breath going, for I was quite </p><p>out of training; if whooped as I drew it, and I felt </p><p>a pain like a knife at my side. I perceived the Thing </p><p>would come up with me long before I reached the </p><p>enclosure, and, desperate and sobbing for my breath, </p><p>I wheeled round upon it and struck at it as it came </p><p>up to me,—struck with all my strength. The stone</p><p>came out of the sling of the handkerchief as I did </p><p>so. As I turned, the Thing, which had been running </p><p>on all-fours, rose to its feet, and the missile fell fair </p><p>on its left temple. The skull rang loud, and the </p><p>animal-man blundered into me, thrust me back with </p><p>its hands, and went staggering past me to fall head- </p><p>long upon the sand with its face in the water; and </p><p>there it lay still. </p><p> I could not bring myself to approach the black</p><p>heap. I left it there, with the water rippling round </p><p>it, under the still stars, and giving it a wide berth </p><p>pursued my way towards the yellow glow of the </p><p>house; and presently, with a positive effect of relief, </p><p>came the pitiful moaning of the puma, the sound </p><p>that had originally driven me out to explore this </p><p>mysterious island. At that, though I was faint and </p><p>horribly fatigued, I gathered together all my </p><p>strength, and began running again towards the </p><p>light. I thought I heard a voice calling me. </p><p>CHAPTER X. </p><p>The Crying of the Mari </p><p>AS I drew near the house I saw that the light </p><p>shone from the open door of my room; and </p><p>then I heard coming from out of the dark- </p><p>ness at the side of that orange oblong of light, the </p><p>voice of Montgomery shouting, “Prendick!” I con- </p><p>tinued running. Presently I heard him again. I </p><p>650 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>replied by a feehle “Hullo!” and in another moment </p><p>had staggered up to him. </p><p> “Where have you been?” said he, holding me at</p><p>arm’s length, so that the light from the door fell </p><p>on my face. “We have both been so busy that we </p><p>forgot you until about half an hour ago.” He </p><p>led me into the room and set me down in the deck </p><p>chair. For awhile I was blinded by the light. “We </p><p>did not think you would start to explore this island </p><p>of ours with telling us,” he said; and then, “I was </p><p>afraid— But — what — Hullo!” </p><p> My last remaining strength slipped from me, and</p><p>my head fell forward on my chest. I think he found </p><p>a certain satisfaction in giving me brandy. </p><p> “For God’s sake,” said I, “fasten that door.”</p><p>“You’ve been meeting some of our curiosities, </p><p>eh?” said he. </p><p> He locked the door and turned to me again. He</p><p>asked me no questions, but gave me some more </p><p>brandy and water and pressed me to eat. I was in </p><p>a state of collapse. He said something vague about </p><p>his forgetting to warn me, and asked me briefly </p><p>when I left the house and what I had seen. </p><p> I answered him as briefly, in fragmentary sen-</p><p>tences. “Tell me what it all means,” said I, in a </p><p>state bordering on hysterics. </p><p> “It’s nothing so very dreadful,” said he. “But</p><p>I think you have had about enough for one day.” </p><p>The puma suddenly gave a sharp yell of pain. At </p><p>that he swore under his breath. “I’m damned,” </p><p>said he, “if this place is not as bad as Gower street, </p><p>with its cats.” </p><p> “Montgomery,” said I, “what was that thing that</p><p>came after me? Was it a beast or was it a man?” </p><p>“If you don’t sleep to-night," he said, “you’ll be </p><p>off your head to-morrow.” </p><p> I stood up in front of him. “What was that thing</p><p>that came after me?” I asked. </p><p> He looked me squarely in the eyes, and twisted his</p><p>mouth askew. His eyes, which had seemed animated </p><p>a minute before, went dull. “From your account,” </p><p>said he, “I’m thinking it was a bogle.” </p><p> I felt a gust of intense irritation, which passed</p><p>as quickly as it came. I flung myself into the chair </p><p>again, and pressed my hands on my forehead. The</p><p>puma began once more. </p><p> Montgomery came round behind me and put his</p><p>hand on my shoulder. “Look here, Prendick,” he </p><p>said, “I had no business to let you drift out into </p><p>this silly island of ours. But it’s Hot so bad as </p><p>you feel, man. Your nerves are worked to rags. </p><p>Let me give you something that will make you </p><p>sleep. That—will keep on for hours yet. You must </p><p>simply get to sleep, or I won’t answer for it.” </p><p> I did not reply. I bowed forward, and covered</p><p>my face with my hands. Presently he returned with </p><p>a small measure containing a dark liquid. This he </p><p>gave me. I took it unresistingly, and he helped me </p><p>into the hammock. </p><p> When I awoke, it was broad day. For a little</p><p>while I lay flat, staring at the roof above me. The </p><p>rafters, I observed, were made out of the timbers </p><p>of a ship. Then I turned my head, and saw a meal </p><p>prepared for me on the table. I perceived that I </p><p>was hungry, and prepared to clamber out of the </p><p>hammock, which, very politely anticipating my in- </p><p>tention, twisted round and deposited me upon all- </p><p>fours on the floor. </p><p> I got up and sat down before the food. I had a</p><p>heavy feeling in my head, and only the vaguest </p><p>memory at first of the things that had happened </p><p>over night. The morning breeze blew very pleas- </p><p>antly through the unglazed window, and that and </p><p>the food contributed to the sense of animal comfort </p><p>which I experienced. Presently the door behind me </p><p>■—the door inward towards the yard of the enclosure </p><p>—opened. I turned and saw Montgomery’s face. </p><p> “All right,” said he. “I’m frightfully busy.” And</p><p>he shut the door. </p><p> Afterwards I discovered that he forgot to "re-</p><p>lock it. Then I recalled the expression of his face </p><p>the previous night, and with that the memory of </p><p>all I had experienced reconstructed itself before </p><p>me. Even as that fear came back to me came a </p><p>cry from within; but this time it was not the cry </p><p>of a puma. I put down the mouthful that hesitated </p><p>upon my lips, and listened. Silence, save for the </p><p>whisper of the morning breeze. I began to think </p><p>my ears had deceived me. </p><p> After a long pause I resumed my meal, but with</p><p>my ears still vigilant. Presently I heard some- </p><p>thing else, very faint and low. I sat as if frozen </p><p>in my attitude. Though it was faint and low, it </p><p>moved me more profoundly than all that I had </p><p>hitherto heard of the abominations behind the</p><p>wall. There was no mistake this time in the </p><p>quality of the dim, broken sounds; no doubt at all </p><p>of their source. For it was groaning, broken by </p><p>sobs and gasps of anguish. It was no brute this </p><p>time; it was a human being in torment! </p><p> As I realised this I rose, and in three steps had</p><p>crossed the rooms, seized the handle of the door </p><p>into the yard, and flung it open before me. </p><p> “Prendick, man! Stop!” cried Montgomery,</p><p>intervening. </p><p> A startled deerhound yelped and snarled. There</p><p>was blood, I saw, in the sink,—brown, and some </p><p>scarlet,—and I smelt the peculiar smell of carbolic </p><p>acid. Then through an open doorway beyond, in </p><p>the dim light of the shadow, I saw something </p><p>bound painfully upon a framework, scarred, red, </p><p>and bandaged; and then blotting this out appeared </p><p>the face of old Moreau, white and terrible. In a </p><p>moment he had gripped me by the shoulder with a </p><p>hand that was smeared red, had twisted me off my </p><p>feet, and flung me headlong back into my own room. </p><p>He lifted me as though I was a little child. I fell </p><p>at full length upon the floor, and the door slammed </p><p>and shut out the passionate intensity of his face. </p><p>Then I heard the key turn in the lock, and Mont- </p><p>gomery’s voice in expostulation. </p><p> “Ruin the work of a lifetime,” I heard Moreau</p><p>say. </p><p> “He does not understand,” said Montgomery,</p><p>and other things that were inaudible. </p><p> “I can’t spare the time yet,” said Moreau.</p><p> The rest I did not hear. I picked myself up and</p><p>stood trembling, my mind a chaos of the most </p><p>horrible misgivings. Could it be possible, I </p><p>thought, that such a thing as the vivisection of </p><p>men was carried on here? The question shot like </p><p>lightning across a tumultuous sky; and suddenly </p><p>the clouded horror of my mind condensed into a </p><p>vivid realisation of my own danger. </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>651 </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>The Hunting of the Man </p><p>IT came before my mind with an unreasonable </p><p>hope of escape that the outer door of my room </p><p>was still open to me. I was convinced now, </p><p>absolutely assured, that Moreau had been vivisect- </p><p>ing a human being. All the time since I had heard </p><p>his name, I had been trying to link in my mind in </p><p>some way the grotesque animalism of the islanders </p><p>with his abominations; and now I thought I saw </p><p>it all. The memory of his work on the transfusion </p><p>of blood recurred to me. These creatures I had </p><p>seen were the victims of some hideous experi- </p><p>ment. These sickening scoundrels had merely in- </p><p>tended to keep me back, to fool me with their dis- </p><p>play of confidence, and presently to fall upon me </p><p>with a fate more horrible than death,—with tor- </p><p>ture; and after torture the most hideous degrada- </p><p>tion it was possible to conceive,—to send me ofi: a </p><p>lost soul, a beast, to the rest of their Comus rout. </p><p> J looked round for some weapon. Nothing. Then</p><p>with an inspiration I turned over the deck chair, </p><p>put my foot on the side of it, and tore away the </p><p>side rail. It happened that a nail came away with </p><p>the wood, and projecting, gave a touch of danger </p><p>to an otherwise petty weapon. I heard a step out- </p><p>side, and incontinently flung open the door and </p><p>found Montgomery within a yard of it. He meant </p><p>to lock the outer door! I raised this nailed stick </p><p>of mine and cut at his face; but he sprang back. </p><p>I hesitated a moment, then turned and fled round </p><p>the corner of the house. “Prendick, man!” I </p><p>heard his astonished cry, “don’t be a silly ass, man J” </p><p> Another minute, thought I, and he would have</p><p>had me locked in, and as ready as a hospital rabbit </p><p>for my fate. He emerged behind the corner, for I </p><p>heard him shout, “Prendick!” Then he began to </p><p>run after me, shouting things as he ran. This </p><p>time running blindly, I went northeastward in a </p><p>direction at right angles to my previous expedition. </p><p>Once, as I went running headlong up the beach, </p><p>I glanced over my shoulder and saw his attendant </p><p>with him. I ran furiously up the slope, over it, </p><p>then turning eastward along a rocky valley fringed </p><p>on either side with jungle I ran for perhaps a </p><p>mile altogether, my chest straining, my heart beat- </p><p>ing in my ears; and then hearing nothing of Mont- </p><p>gomery or his man, and feeling upon the verge of </p><p>exhaustion, I doubled sharply back towards the </p><p>beach as I judged, and lay down in the shelter of </p><p>a canebrake. There I remained for a long time, too</p><p>fearful to move, and indeed too fearful even to </p><p>plan a course of action. The wild scene about me </p><p>lay sleeping silently under the sun, and the only </p><p>sound near me was the thin hum of some small </p><p>gnats that had discovered me. Presently I became </p><p>aware of a drowsy breathing sound, the soughing </p><p>of the sea upon the beach. </p><p> After about an hour I heard Montgomery shout-</p><p>ing my name, far away to the north. That set me </p><p>thinking of my plan of action. As I interpreted it </p><p>then, this island was inhabited only by these two </p><p>vivisectors and their animalised victims. Some of </p><p>these no doubt they could press into their service </p><p>against me if need arose. I knew both Moreau and </p><p>Montgomery carried revolvers; and, save for a' </p><p>feeble bar of deal spiked with a small nail, the </p><p>merest mockery of a mace, I was unarmed. </p><p> So I lay still, until I began to think of food and</p><p>drink; and at that thought the real hopelessness of </p><p>my position came home to me. I knew no way of </p><p>getting anything to eat. I was too ignorant of </p><p>botany to discover any resort of root or fruit that </p><p>might lie about me; I had no means of trapping the </p><p>few rabbits upon the island. It grew blanker the </p><p>more I turned the prospect over. At last in the </p><p>desperation of my position, my mind turned to the </p><p>animal men I had encountered. I tried to find some </p><p>hope in what I remembered of them. In turn I </p><p>recalled each one I had seen, and tried to draw </p><p>some augury of assistance from my memory. </p><p> Then suddenly I heard a stag-hound bay, and at</p><p>that realised a new danger. I took little time to </p><p>think, or they would have caught me then, but </p><p>snatching up my nailed stick, rushed headlong from </p><p>my hiding-place towards the sound of the sea. I </p><p>remember a growth of thorny plants, with spines </p><p>that stabbed like pen-knives. I emerged bleeding </p><p>and with torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek </p><p>opening northward. I went straight into the water </p><p>without a minute’s hesitation, wading up the creek, </p><p>and presently finding myself knee-deep in a little </p><p>stream. I scrambled out at last on the westward </p><p>bank, and with my heart beating loudly in my ears, </p><p>crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue. I </p><p>heard the dog (there was only one) draw nearer, </p><p>and yelp when it came to the thorns. Then I heard </p><p>no more, and presently began to think I had escaped. </p><p> The minutes passed; the silence lengthened out,</p><p>and at last after an hour of security my courage </p><p>began to return to me. By this time I was no longer </p><p>very much terrified or very miserable. I had, as </p><p>it were, passed the limit of terror and despair. I </p><p>felt now that my life was practcically lost, and that</p><p>persuasion made me capable of daring anything. I </p><p>had even a certain wish to encounter Moreau face </p><p>to face; and as I had waded into the water, I </p><p>remembered that if I were too hard pressed at </p><p>least one path of escape from torment still lay open </p><p>to me,—they could not very well prevent my drown- </p><p>ing myself. I had half a mind to drown myself </p><p>then; but an odd wish to see the whole adventure </p><p>out, a queer, impersonal, spectacular interest in </p><p>myself, restrained me. I stretched my limbs, sore </p><p>and painful from the pricks of the spiny plants, and </p><p>stared around me at the trees; and, so suddenly that </p><p>it seemed to jump out of the green tracery about it, </p><p>my eyes lit upon a black face watching me. I saw </p><p>that it was the simian creature who had met the </p><p>launch upon the beach. He was clinging to the </p><p>oblique stem of a palm-tree. I gripped my stick, </p><p>and stood up facing him. He began chattering. </p><p>“You, you, you,” was all I could distinguish at first. </p><p>Suddenly he dropped from the tree, and in another </p><p>moment was holding the fronds apart and staring </p><p>curiously at me. </p><p> I did not feel the same repugnance towards this</p><p>creature which I had experienced in my encounters </p><p>with the other Beast Men. “You, he said, “in the </p><p>boat.” He was a man, then,—-at least as much of </p><p>a man as Montgomery’s attendant,—for he could </p><p>talk. </p><p> “Yes,” I said, “I came in the boat. From the</p><p>ship.” </p><p>652 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “Oh!” he said, and his bright, restless eyes</p><p>travelled over me, to my hands, to the stick I </p><p>carried, to my feet, to the tattered places in my </p><p>coat, and the cuts and scratches I had received </p><p>from the thorns. He seemed puzzled at something. </p><p>His eyes came back to my hands. He held his </p><p>own hand out and counted his digits slowly, “One </p><p>two, three, four, five—eigh?” </p><p> I did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I</p><p>was to find that a great proportion of these Beast </p><p>People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes </p><p>even three digits. But guessing this was in some </p><p>way a greeting, I did the same thing by way of </p><p>reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction. </p><p>Then his swift roving glance went round again; he </p><p>made a swift movement—and vanished. The fern </p><p>fronds he had stood between came swishing together. </p><p> I pushed out of the brake after him, and was</p><p>astonished to find him swinging cheerfully by one </p><p>lank arm from a rope of creeper that looped down </p><p>from the foliage overhead. His back was to me. </p><p> “Hullo!” said I.</p><p> He came down with a twisting jump, and stood</p><p>facing me. </p><p> “I say,” said I, “where can I get something to</p><p>eat?” </p><p> “Eat!” he said. “Eat Man’s food, now.” And</p><p>his eye went back to the swing of ropes. “At the </p><p>huts/' </p><p> “But where are the huts?”</p><p> “Oh!”</p><p> “I'm new, you know.”</p><p> At that he swung round, and set-off at a quick</p><p>walk. All his motions were curiously rapid. “Come </p><p>along,” said he. </p><p> I went with him to see the adventure out. I</p><p>guessed the huts were some rough shelter where </p><p>he and some more of these Beast People lived. I </p><p>might perhaps find them friendly, find some handle </p><p>in their minds to take hold of. I did not know </p><p>how far they had forgotten their human heritage. </p><p> My ape-like companion trotted along by my side,</p><p>with his hands hanging down and his jaw thrust</p><p>forward. I wondered what memory he might have </p><p>in him. “How long have you been on this island?” </p><p>paid I. </p><p> “How long?” he asked; and after having the</p><p>question repeated, he held up three fingers. </p><p> The creature was little better than an idiot I</p><p>tried to make out what he meant by that, and it </p><p>seems I bored him. After another question or </p><p>two he suddenly left my side and went leaping at </p><p>some fruit that hung from a tree. He pulled down </p><p>a handful of prickly husks and went on eating the </p><p>contents. I noted this with satisfaction, for here </p><p>at least was a hint for feeding. I tried him with </p><p>some other questions, but his chattering, prompt </p><p>responses were as often as not quite at cross pur- </p><p>poses with my question. Some few were appro- </p><p>priate, others quite parrot-like. </p><p> I was so intent upon these peculiarities that I</p><p>scarcely noticed the path we followed. Presently </p><p>we came to trees, all charred and brown, and so to </p><p>a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrusta- </p><p>tion, across which a drifting smoke, pungent in </p><p>whiffs to nose and eyes, went drifting. On our </p><p>right, over a shoulder of bare rock, I saw the level </p><p>blue of the sea. The path coiled down abruptly into </p><p>a narrow ravine between two tumbled and knotty </p><p>masses of blackish scori®. Into this we plunged. </p><p> It was extremely dark, this passage, after the</p><p>blinding sunlinght reflected from the sulphurous </p><p>ground. Its walls grew steep, and approached each </p><p>other. Blotches of green and crimson drifted across </p><p>my eyes. My conductor stopped suddenly. “Home!” </p><p>said he, and I stood on a floor of a chasm that was </p><p>at first absolutely dark to me. I heard some strange </p><p>noises, and thrust the knuckles of my left hand </p><p>into my eyes. I beeame aware of a disagreeable </p><p>odor, like that of a monkey’s cage ill-cleaned. Be- </p><p>yond, the rock opened again upon a gradual slope </p><p>of sunlit greenery, and on either hand the light </p><p>smote down through narrow ways into the central </p><p>gloom. </p><p>CHAPTER XII. </p><p>The Sayers of the Law </p><p>THEN something cold touched my hand. I </p><p>started violently, and saw close to me a dim </p><p>pinkish thing, looking more like a flayed </p><p>child than anything else in the world. The crea- </p><p>ture had exactly the mild but repulsive features of </p><p>a sloth, the same low forehead and slow gestures. </p><p> As the first shock of the change of light passed,</p><p>I saw about me more distintly. The little sloth- </p><p>like creature was standing and staring at me. My </p><p>conductor had vanished. The place was a narrow </p><p>passage between high walls of lava, a crack in the </p><p>knotted rock, and on either side interwoven heaps </p><p>of sea-mat, palmfans, and reeds leaning against </p><p>rock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens. </p><p>The winding way up the ravine between these was </p><p>scarcely three yards wide, and was disfigured by </p><p>lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse, </p><p>which accounted for the disagreeable stench of the </p><p>place. </p><p> The little pink sloth-creature was still blinking</p><p>at me when my Ape-man reappeared at the aper- </p><p>ture of the nearest of these dens, and beckoned me </p><p>in. As he did so, a slouching monster wriggled out </p><p>of one of the places, further up this strange street, </p><p>and stood up in featureless silhouette against the </p><p>bright green beyond, staring at me. I hesitated, </p><p>having half a mind to bolt the way I had come; and </p><p>then, determined to go through with the adventure, </p><p>I gripped my nailed stick about the middle and </p><p>crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to after </p><p>my conductor. </p><p> It was a semi-circular space, shaped like the</p><p>half of a bee-hive; and against the rocky wall that </p><p>formed the inner side of it was a pile of variegated </p><p>fruits, cocoa-nuts among others. Some rough </p><p>vessels of lava and wood stood about the floor, and </p><p>one on a rough stool. There was no fire. In the </p><p>darkest corner of the hut sat a shapeless mass of </p><p>darkness that grunted “Hey!” as I came in, and my </p><p>Ape-man stood in the dim light of the doorway and </p><p>held out a split cocoa-nut to me as I crawled into </p><p>the other corner and squatted down. I took it, </p><p>and began gnawing it, as serenely as possible, in </p><p>spite of a certain trepidation and the nearly intoler- </p><p>able closeness of the den. The little pink sloth- </p><p>creature stood in the aperture of the hut, and some- </p><p>thing else with a drab face and bright eyes cam© </p><p>staring over its shoulder. </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR'. MOREAU </p><p>653 </p><p> “Hey!” came out of the lump of mystery opposite.</p><p>“It is a man.” </p><p> “It is a man,” gabbled my conductor,—“a man,</p><p>a man, a five-man, like me.” </p><p> “Shut up!” said the voice from the dark, and</p><p>grunted. I gnawed my cocoa-nut amid an impres- </p><p>sive stillness. </p><p> I peered hard into the blackness, but could dis-</p><p>tinguish nothing. </p><p> “It is a man,” the voice repeated. “He comes to</p><p>live with us?” </p><p> It was a thick voice, with something in it—a kind</p><p>of whistling overtone—that struck me as peculiar; </p><p>but the English accent was strangely good. </p><p> The Ape-man looked at me as though he expected</p><p>something. I perceived the pause was interrogative. </p><p>“He comes to live with you," I said. </p><p> “It is a man. He must learn the Law.”</p><p> I began to distinguish now a deeper blackness</p><p>in the black, a vague outline of a hunched-up figure. </p><p>Then I noticed the opening of the place was dark- </p><p>ened by two more black heads. My hand tightened </p><p>on my stick. </p><p> The thing in the dark repeated in a louder tone,</p><p>“Say the words.” I had missed its last remark. </p><p>“Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law,” it repeated </p><p>in a kind of sing-song. </p><p> I was puzzled.</p><p> “Say the words,” said the Ape-man, repeating,</p><p>and the figures in the doorway echoed this, with a </p><p>threat in the tone of their voices. </p><p> I realised that I had to repeat this idiotic form-</p><p>ula; and then began the insanest ceremony. The </p><p>voice in the dark began intoning a mad litany, line </p><p>by line, and I and the rest to repeat it. As they </p><p>did so, they swayed from side to side in the oddest </p><p>way, and beat their hands upon their knees; and I </p><p>followed their example. I could have imagined I was </p><p>already dead and in another world. The dark hut, </p><p>these grotesque dim figures, just flecked here and </p><p>there by a glimmer of light, and all of them sway- </p><p>ing in unison and chanting. </p><p> “Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law. Are</p><p>we not Men? </p><p> “Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law. Are</p><p>we not Men? </p><p> “Not to eat Fish or Flesh; that is the Law. Are</p><p>we not Men? </p><p> “Not to claw the Bark of Trees; that is the Law.</p><p>Are we not Men? </p><p> “Not to chase other Men; that is the Law. Are</p><p>we not Men ?” </p><p> And so from the prohibition of these acts of folly,</p><p>on to the prohibition of what I thought then </p><p>were the maddest, most impossible, and most in- </p><p>decent things one could well imagine. A kind of </p><p>rhythmic fervour fell on all of us; we gabbled and </p><p>swayed faster and faster, repeating this amazing </p><p>Law. Superficially the contagion of these brutes </p><p>was upon me, but deep down within me the laughter </p><p>and disgust struggled together. We ran through </p><p>a long list of prohibitions, and then the chant swung </p><p>round to a new formula. </p><p> “His is the House of Pain.</p><p> “His is the Hand that makes.</p><p> "His is the Hand that wounds.</p><p> “His is the Hand that heals.”</p><p> And so on for another long series, mostly quite</p><p>incomprehensible gibberish to me about Him, who- </p><p>ever he might be. I could have fancied it was a </p><p>dream, but never before have I heard chanting in a </p><p>dream. </p><p> “His is the lightning flash,” we sang. “His is</p><p>the deep, salt sea.” </p><p> A horrible fancy came Into my head that Moreau,</p><p>after animalising these men, had infected their </p><p>dwarfed brains with a kind of deification of him- </p><p>self. However, I was too keenly aware of white </p><p>teeth and strong claws about me to stop my chant- </p><p>ing on that account. </p><p> “His are the stars in the sky.”</p><p> At last that song ended. I saw the Ape-man’s</p><p>face shining with perspiration; and my eyes being </p><p>now accustomed to the darkness, I saw more dis- </p><p>tinctly the figure in the corner from which the </p><p>voice came. It was the size of a man, but it</p><p>seemed covered with a dull grey hair almost like </p><p>a Skye-terrier. What was it? What were they </p><p>all? Imagine yourself surrounded by all the most </p><p>horrible cripples and maniacs it is possible to con- </p><p>ceive, and you may understand a little of my feel- </p><p>ings with these grotesque caricatures of humanity </p><p>about me. </p><p> “He is a five-man, a five-man, a five-man—like</p><p>me,” said the Ape-man. </p><p> I held out my hands. The grey creature in the</p><p>corner leant forward. </p><p> “Not to run on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we</p><p>not Men?” he said. </p><p> He put out a strangely distorted talon and grip-</p><p>ped my fingers. The thing was almost like the </p><p>hoof of a deer produced into claws. I could have </p><p>yelled with surprise and pain. His face came for- </p><p>ward and peered at my nails, came forward into </p><p>the light of the opemng of the hut; and I saw with </p><p>quivering disgust that it was like the face of neither </p><p>man nor beast, but a mere shock of grey hair, with </p><p>three shadowy over-archings to mark the eyes and </p><p>mouth. </p><p> “He has little nails,” said this grisly creature in</p><p>his hairy beard. “It is well.” </p><p> He threw my hand down, and instinctively I</p><p>gripped my stick. </p><p> “Eat roots and herbs; it is His will,” said the</p><p>Ape-man. </p><p> “I am the Sayer of the Law,” said the grey figure.</p><p>“Here come all that be new to learn the Law. I </p><p>sit in the darkness and say the Law.” </p><p> “It is even so,” said one of the beasts in the door-</p><p>way. </p><p> “Evil are the punishments of those who break the</p><p>Law. None escape.” </p><p> “None escape,” said the Beast Folk, glancing</p><p>furtively at one another. </p><p> “None, none,” said the Ape-man,—“none escape.</p><p>See! I did a little thing, a wrong thing, once. I </p><p>jabbered, jabbered, stopped talking. None could </p><p>understand. I am burnt, branded in the hand. He </p><p>is great. He is good!” </p><p> “None escape,” said the grey creature in the</p><p>corner.</p><p> “None escape,” said the Beast People, looking</p><p>askance at one another. </p><p>654 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p> “For every one the want that is bad,” said the</p><p>grey Sayer of the Law. “What you will want we </p><p>do not know; we shall know. Some want to </p><p>follow things that move, to watch and slink and </p><p>wait and spring; to kill and bite, bite deep and </p><p>rich, sucking the blood. It is bad. Not to chase </p><p>other Men; that is the Law. Are we not Men? </p><p>Not to eat Flesh or Fish; that is the Law. Are we </p><p>not Men?'” </p><p> “None escape,” said a dappled brute standing in</p><p>the doorway. </p><p> “For every one the want is bad,” said the grey</p><p>Sayer of the Law. “Some want to go tearing with </p><p>teeth and hands into the roots of things, snuffing </p><p>into the earth. It is bad.” </p><p> “None escape,” said the men in the door.</p><p> “Some go clawing trees; some go scratching at</p><p>the graves of the dead; some go fighting with fore- </p><p>heads or feet or claws; some bite suddenly, none </p><p>giving occasion; some love uncleanness.” </p><p> “None escape,” said the Ape-man, scratching his</p><p>calf. </p><p> “None escape," said the little pink sloth-creature.</p><p> “Punishment is sharp and sure. Therefore learn</p><p>the Law. Say the words.” </p><p> And incontinently he began again the strange</p><p>litany of the Law, and again I and all these creatures </p><p>began singing and swaying. My head reeled with </p><p>this jabbering and the close stench of the place; </p><p>but I kept on, trusting to find presently some chance </p><p>of a new development. </p><p> “Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we</p><p>not Menf” </p><p> We were making such a noise that I noticed noth-</p><p>ing of a tumult outside, until some one, who I </p><p>think was one of the two Swine Men I had seen, </p><p>thrust his head over the little pink sloth-creature </p><p>and shouted something excitedly, something that I </p><p>did not catch. Incontinently those at the opening </p><p>of the hut vanished; my Ape-man rushed out; the </p><p>thing that had sat in the dark followed him (I only </p><p>observed that it was big and clumsy, and covered </p><p>with silvery hair), and I was left alone. Then </p><p>before I reached the aperture I heard the yelp of a </p><p>staghound.</p><p> In another moment I was standing outside the</p><p>hovel, my chair-rail in my hand, every muscle of </p><p>me quivering. Before me were the clumsy backs </p><p>of perhaps a score of these Beast People, their </p><p>misshapen heads half hidden by their shoulder- </p><p>blades. They were gesticulating excitedly. Other </p><p>half-animal faces glared interrogation out of the </p><p>hovels. Looking in the direction in which they </p><p>faced, I saw coming through the haze under the </p><p>trees beyond the end of the passage of dens the </p><p>dark figure and awful white face of Moreau. He </p><p>was holding the leaping staghound back, and close </p><p>behind him came Montgomery revolver in hand. </p><p> For a moment I stood horror-struck. I turned</p><p>and saw the passage behind me blocked by another </p><p>heavy brute, with a huge grey face and twinkling </p><p>little eyes, advancing towards me. I looked round </p><p>and saw to the right of me and a half-dozen yards </p><p>in front of me a narrow gap in the wall of rock </p><p>through which a ray of light slanted into the shad- </p><p>dows. </p><p> “Stop!” cried Moreau as I strode towards this,</p><p>and then, “Hold him!” </p><p> At that, first one face turned towards me and then</p><p>others. Their bestial minds were happily slow. </p><p>I dashed my shoulders into a clumsy monster who </p><p>was turning to see what Moreau meant, and flung </p><p>him forward into another. I felt his hands fly </p><p>round, clutching at me and missing me. The little </p><p>pink sloth-creature dashed at me, and I gashed down </p><p>its ugly face with the nail in my stick, and in an- </p><p>other minute was scrambling up a steep side path- </p><p>way, a kind of sloping chimney, out of the ravine. </p><p>I heard a howl behind me, and cries of “Catch him!” </p><p>“Hold him!” and the grey-faced creature appeared </p><p>behind me and jammed his huge bulk into the cleft. </p><p>“Go on! go on!” they howled. I clambered up the </p><p>narrow cleft in the rock and came out upon the </p><p>sulphur on the westward side of the village of the </p><p>Beast Men. </p><p> That gap was altogether fortunate for me, for the</p><p>narrow chimney, slanting obliquely upward, must </p><p>have impeded the nearer pursuers. I ran over the </p><p>white space and down a steep slope, through a </p><p>scattered growth of trees, and came to a low-lying </p><p>stretch of tall reeds, through which I pushed into </p><p>a dark, thick undergrowth that was black and </p><p>succulent under foot. As I plunged into the reeds, </p><p>my foremost pursuers emerged from the gap. I </p><p>broke my way through this undergrowth for some </p><p>minutes. The air behind me and about me was soon </p><p>full of threatening cries. I heard the tumult of my </p><p>pursuers in the gap up the slope, then the crash-</p><p>ing of the reeds, and every now and then the </p><p>crackling crash of a branch. Some of the creatures </p><p>roared like excited beasts of prey. The staghound </p><p>yelped to the leffc. I heard Moreau and Montgomery </p><p>shouting in the same direction. I turned sharply </p><p>to the right. It seemed to me even then that I </p><p>heard Montgomery shouting for me to run for my </p><p>life. </p><p> Presently the ground gave rich and oozy under</p><p>my feet; but I was desperate and went headlong </p><p>into it, struggled through knee-deep, and so came </p><p>to a winding path among tall canes. The noise of </p><p>my pursuers passed away to my left. In one place </p><p>three strange, pink, hopping animals, about the </p><p>size of cats, bolted before my footsteps. This path- </p><p>way ran up-hill, across another open space covered </p><p>with white incrustation, and plunged into a cane- </p><p>brake again. Then suddenly it turned parallel with </p><p>the edge of a steep-walled gap, which came without </p><p>warning, like the ha-ha of an English park,—turned </p><p>with an unexpected abruptness. I was still running </p><p>with all my might, and I never saw this drop until </p><p>I was flying headlong through the air. </p><p> I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns,</p><p>and rose with a torn ear and bleeding face. I had </p><p>fallen into a precipitous ravine, rocky and thorny, </p><p>full of hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps, </p><p>and with a narrow streamlet from which this mist </p><p>came meandering down the centre. I was astonished </p><p>at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight; but </p><p>I had no time to stand wondering then. I turned </p><p>to my right, down-stream, hoping to come to the </p><p>sea in that direction, and so have my way open to </p><p>drown myself. It was only later I found that I had </p><p>dropped my nailed stick in my fall. </p><p> Presently the ravine grew narrower for a space,</p><p>and carelessly I stepped into the stream. I jumped </p><p>out again pretty quiekly, for the water was almost </p><p>THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU </p><p>655 </p><p>boiling. I noticed too there was a thin sulphurous </p><p>scum drifting upon its coiling water. Almost im- </p><p>mediately came a turn in the ravine, and the in- </p><p>distinct blue horizon. The nearer sea was flashing </p><p>the sun from a myriad facets. I saw my death be- </p><p>fore me; but I was hot and panting, with the warm </p><p>blood oozing out on my face and running pleasantly </p><p>through my veins. I felt more than a touch of </p><p>exultation too, at having distanced my pursuers. It </p><p>was not in me then to go out and drown myself yet. </p><p>I started back the way I had come. </p><p> I listened. Save for the hum of the gnats and the</p><p>chirp of some small insects that hopped among the </p><p>thorns, the air was absolutely still. Then came </p><p>the yelp of a dog, very faint, and a chattering and </p><p>gibbering, the snap of a whip, and voices. They </p><p>grew louder, then fainter again. The noise receded </p><p>up the stream and faded away. For a while the </p><p>chase was over; but I knew now how much hope </p><p>of help for me lay in the Beast People. </p><p>CHAPTER XIII. </p><p>A Parley </p><p>I TURNED again and went on down towards </p><p>the sea. I found the hot stream broadened </p><p>out to a shallow, weedy sand, in which an </p><p>abundance of crabs and long-bodied, many-legged </p><p>creatures started from my footfall. I walked to </p><p>the very edge of the salt water, and then I felt I </p><p>was safe. I turned and stared, arms akimbo, at the </p><p>thick green behind me, into which the steamy ravine </p><p>cut like a smoking gash. But, as I say, I was too </p><p>full of excitement and (a true saying, though those </p><p>who have never known danger may doubt it) too </p><p>desperate to die. </p><p> Then it came into my head that there was one</p><p>chance before me yet. While Moreau and Mont- </p><p>gomery and their bestial rabble chased me through </p><p>the island, might I not go round the beach until I </p><p>came to their enclosure,—make a flank march upon </p><p>them, in fact, and then with a rock lugged out of </p><p>their loosely-built wall, perhaps, smash in the lock </p><p>of the smaller door and see what I could find (knife, </p><p>pistol, or what not) to fight them with when they </p><p>returned ? It was at any rate something to try. </p><p> So I turned to the westward and walked along by</p><p>the water’s edge. The setting sun flashed his </p><p>blinding heat into my eyes. The slight Pacific tide </p><p>was running in with a gentle ripple. Presently the </p><p>shore fell away southward, and the sun came round</p><p>upon my right hand. Then suddenly, far in front </p><p>of me, I saw first one and then several figures </p><p>emerging from the bushes,—Moreau, with his grey </p><p>staghound, then Montgomery, and two others. At </p><p>that I stopped. </p><p> They saw me, and began gesticulating and ad-</p><p>vancing. I stood watching them approach. The </p><p>two Beast Men came running forward to cut me </p><p>off from the undergrowth, inland. Montgomery </p><p>came, running also, but straight towards me. Mor- ' </p><p>eau followed slower with the dog. </p><p> At last I roused myself from my inaction, and</p><p>turning seaward walked straight into the water. </p><p>The water was very shallow at first. I was thirty </p><p>yards out before the waves reached to my waist. </p><p>Dimly I could see the intertidal creatures darting </p><p>away from my feet. </p><p> "What are you doing, man?” cried Montgomery.</p><p> I turned, standing waist deep, and stared at them.</p><p> Montgomery stood panting at the margin of the</p><p> water. His face was bright-red with exertion, his</p><p> long flaxen hair blown about his head, and his drop-</p><p> ping nether lip showed his irregular teeth. Moreau</p><p> was just coming up, his face pale and firm, and</p><p> the dog at his hand barked at me. Both men had</p><p> heavy whips. Farther up the beach stared the</p><p> Beast Men.</p><p> “What am I doing? I am going to drown my-</p><p>self,” said I. </p><p> Montgomery and Moreau looked at each other.</p><p>“Why?” asked Moreau. </p><p> “Because that is better than being tortured by</p><p>you.” </p><p> “I told you so,” said Montgomery, and Moreau</p><p>said something in a low tone. </p><p> “What makes you th.ink I shall torture you?”</p><p>asked Moreau. </p><p> “What I saw,” I said. “And those—yonder.”</p><p> “Hush!” said Moreau, and held up his hand.</p><p> “I will not,” said I. “They were men: what</p><p>are they now? I at least will not be like them.” </p><p> I looked past my interlocutors. Up the beach'</p><p>were M’ling, Montgomery’s attendant, and one of </p><p>the white-swathed brutes from the boat. Farther </p><p>up, in the shadow of the trees, I saw my little Ape-</p><p>man, and behind him some other dim figures. </p><p> “Who are these creatures?” said I, pointing to</p><p>them and raising my voice more and more that it </p><p>might reach them. “They were men, men like </p><p>yo.urselves, whom you have infected with some </p><p>bestial taint,—men whom you have enslaved, and </p><p>whom you still fear. You who listen,” I cried, point- </p><p>ing now to Moreau and shouting past him to the </p><p>Beast Men,—“You who listen! Do you not see </p><p>these men still fear you, go in dread of you ? Why, </p><p>then, do you fear them ? You are many—” </p><p> “For God’s sake,” cried Montgomery, “stop that,</p><p> Prendick!”</p><p> “Prendick!” cried Moreau.</p><p> They both shouted together, as if to drown my</p><p>voice; and behind them lowered the staring faces </p><p>of the Beast Men, wondering, their deformed hands </p><p>hanging down, their shoulders hunched up. They </p><p>seemed, as I fancied, to be trying to understand </p><p>me, to remember, I thought, something of their </p><p>human past. </p><p> I went on shouting, I scarcely remember what,</p><p>—that Moreau and Montgomery could be killed, that </p><p>they were not to be feared: that was the burden </p><p>of what I put into the heads of the Beast People. </p><p>I saw the green-eyed man in the dark rags, who </p><p>had met me on the evening of my arrival, come out </p><p>from among the trees, and others followed him, </p><p>to hear me better. At last for want of breath I </p><p>paused. </p><p> “Listen to me for a moment,” said the steady</p><p>voice of Moreau; “and then say what you will.” </p><p>. “Well?” said I. </p><p> He coughed, thought, then shouted: “Latin,</p><p>Prendick! bad Latin, schoolboy Latin; but try and </p><p>understand. Hi non sunt homines; sunt animalia </p><p>qui nos habemus—vivisected, A humanising pro- </p><p>cess. I will explain. Come ashore.” </p><p>I laughed. “A pretty story,” said I. “They </p><p>(Continued on page 671) </p><p> BLASPHEMERS’ PLATEAU</p><p>. . » fthen ho perceived the futility of struggling further, he lay quietly. ...

Why? </p><p>What is it?” noting the driver’s air of disappoint- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “We can’t do business then, I guess, Mister.</p><p>Leastwise, ’twouldn’t be right for me to drive you </p><p>up there and then have to bring you right back; now </p><p>would it?” </p><p> Mason eyed the shabby old fellow of the delicate</p><p>scruples with surprise, </p><p> “Do you mean to tell me I can’t get in unless I’m</p><p>expected ?” </p><p> The driver nodded. “Not after dark you can’t,</p><p>Mister. It’d be that by the time we covered the four </p><p>mile’ to his place.” He jerked a thumb in the direc- </p><p>tion of the crow-bait standing dejectedly between </p><p>the shafts of an ancient vehicle. “The old gray mare, </p><p>she ain’t what she used to be,” he apologized. </p><p> “You’re right,” agreed Mason, glancing at the</p><p>horse. “She’s no descendant of Pegasus, to judge by </p><p>externals. Well— what am I to do then, if you’re so </p><p>positive there’s no use going up there tonight? </p><p>Where shall I stay? There’s no sense taking the next </p><p>train out, that is, supposing there is one before </p><p>morning.” </p><p> The driver appraised him swiftly. “Well, now,</p><p>Mister, you coidd stop up to The Travelers’ Hotel for </p><p>the night, and travel on up in the morning. How’d </p><p>that suit you? Hotel’s a mile in the other direction.” </p><p> Mason shrugged his shoulders resignedly, “ ‘Needs</p><p>must, when the devil drives’—Oh! I beg your par- </p><p>don! I meant nothing personal,” he amended, at the </p><p>driver’s laugh. “All right, then. The Hotel it shall </p><p>be.” </p><p> He climbed into the hack agilely enough for one</p><p>of his apparent years, and settled into the seat next </p><p>the driver’s, while the latter untied the looped reins </p><p>from around the stock of the whin, resting in its </p><p>socket, slapped them up and down, and clucked to </p><p>the mare. </p><p> “Are you a native</p><p>here?” asked Mason, as </p><p>they backed away from </p><p>the station and lurched </p><p>into the road. </p><p> “I be’n born and</p><p>brought up here, Mister,” </p><p>responded the driver, glad </p><p>of an opportunity to while </p><p>away the trip ahead. </p><p> “Then you probably</p><p>know Doctor Santurn?” </p><p>onto ten year’ ago. Beats all how he keeps to him- </p><p>self. Folks do say though-” he stopped appre- </p><p>hensively. </p><p> “Go on!” said Mason encouragingly. “You won’t</p><p>offend me. If its the truth, then that’s that; and if </p><p>it’s a lie, I’ll get him to nail it when I see him to- </p><p>morrow.” </p><p> “Well—where’d his menagerie come from?”</p><p>blurted out the driver, turning half around toward </p><p>his seat mate. </p><p> “Menagerie! Do you mean to say he has one?”</p><p> “Yes! An’ a ’quarium too!” declared the driver</p><p>emphatically. “He had the cages and tanks built </p><p>apart from the house ’fore ever he moved in. An’ </p><p>the funny part of it is—where’d the animals come </p><p>from? An’ the fish? We never did see even one </p><p>crate come in by way of the railroad station, nor </p><p>anything that looked like a cage loaded on motor </p><p>trucks neither. ’Course, there’s be’n two or three </p><p>of us be’n inside the gates on business—repairs an’ </p><p>sich, quite a while ago, an’ they saw plenty. An’ </p><p>now’n then there’s city visitors like yourself; but </p><p>they never bring nothin’ but small boxes or a hand- </p><p>bag. Once in a while, come to think of it, there’s </p><p>heavy machinery comes by freight; but folks t’other </p><p>side of The Plateau say there never was a load of </p><p>critters brought in that way neither.” </p><p> Mason frowned. “What’s the difference how they</p><p>arrived? They probably came by night in covered </p><p>motor trucks. Don’t you know the Doctor i3 a </p><p>world-famous biologist? He knows more about </p><p>animals and what makes them tick than the next</p><p>best half dozen put together. Get on with you, </p><p>man! Are you trying to build a mystery around </p><p>him?” </p><p> “No, no, Mister!” protested the driver. “There’s</p><p>funny doin’s goes on in those buildings of his’n up </p><p>there 011 The Plateau. An’ he never shows himself </p><p>a tall. He just sends his Jap man down with a little </p><p>car for mail and supplies, an’ keeps to himself </p><p>year in an’ year out, ’cept for three 01* four men </p><p>’round the place. There! We’re nearing the Hotel. </p><p>’Nother half mile or so an’ we’ll be there. Whoa!” </p><p>drawing on the reins. “Hear that?” </p><p> “Music? Faint music?” asked Mason.</p><p> “Giddap! Yes, Mister.

Good </p><p>night!” He turned and entered the small frame </p><p>658 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>building that boasted the title of Hotel, and was </p><p>heartily received by the rustic proprietor. </p><p> “Sure, now, Mr.-Mason” (glancing at the an-</p><p>cient register in which the newcomer had inscribed </p><p>his name) “I’ll be glad to put you up for the night. </p><p>I’ll show you to your room so’s you can freshen up </p><p>a bit, and when you come down there’ll be a snack </p><p>of supper on the table for you.” </p><p>What the Local Inn-Keeper Said </p><p>IT was rather cool and gusty outdoors, for early </p><p>summer, and the dark and rutty roadways lack- </p><p>ed appeal for an after supper stroll for Mason </p><p>who contented himself with sitting in the “parlor” </p><p>with his host. He recounted what the driver had </p><p>told him. </p><p> “’S truth!” said the innkeeper earnestly to his</p><p>solitary guest. “Ben warn’t lying. You try an’ get </p><p>in on The Plateau after dark, an’ you’ll look down </p><p>the mean end of a sawed-off shotgun. There’s a </p><p>night-watchman at the gate, an’ the wall’s high </p><p>an’ studded with broken glass. The watchman </p><p>won't listen to no talk whatsoever. An’ while you’re </p><p>turnin’ around preparin’ to come back, you’ll may- </p><p>be hear some funny noises from beyond the wall.” </p><p>“Pardon my asking," interrupted Mason, “but </p><p>does the Doctor owe anything in the village?” </p><p> “No.”</p><p> “Anybody miss anything?”</p><p> “Not so’s I’ve heard,” said the innkeeper.</p><p>“Anybody disappear without a trace?” ironically. </p><p>“I see what you’re gettin’ at, Mr. Mason. Sort </p><p>of a polite way of askin’ why don’t we mind our </p><p>business if he does no harm? There’s not much to </p><p>do in these parts, though, ’cept to speculate on other </p><p>folks’ business. An’ I do admit the Doctor’s fair </p><p>game for the curious.” </p><p> “Fair enough,” admitted Mason. “I haven’t seen</p><p>him in years myself; but from what I know, he </p><p>likes seclusion and doesn’t care for a strange audi- </p><p>ence, particularly when he’s performing some ex- </p><p>periment.” </p><p> “ ’Tain’t vivisection.” ventured the host.</p><p> “How do you know?”</p><p> “The cages get fuller, ’stead of emptier, an’ the</p><p>critters ain’t breedin’ ’cause there’s only one of </p><p>each. Carpenter knows. He was up there a month </p><p>ago to reinforce a cage, an’ he says a big monkey </p><p>a’most grabbed him ’tween the bars.” </p><p> The evening waned rapidly as the innkeeper de-</p><p>tailed the petty gossip of the village centering on the </p><p>“doings” that occurred up on The Plateau; and when </p><p>Mason climbed gratefully into the huge four-poster </p><p>with its generous patchquilt, shortly before eleven, </p><p>he lay wondering what the morrow held in store. </p><p>Despite his deprecations and attempts to dispel the </p><p>air of mystery with which the Hotel proprietor had </p><p>invested the Doctor, some of the village’s supersti- </p><p>tion attached itself to him and disturbed his sleep. </p><p>Getting Into the “Blasphemers’ Plateau” </p><p>AFTER a leisurely breakfast, Mason settled </p><p>his account, bade the innkeeper adieu, and </p><p>climbed, for the second time, to his seat in </p><p>Old Ben’s hack, which the garrulous driver had </p><p>brought around on time. </p><p> Jog-jog, talk-talk, jogJjog. Then the labored</p><p>breathing of the old horse as she hauled her bur- </p><p>den along the stiff upgrade. The scrunch of wheels </p><p>overriding the edges of the ruts; the clop-clop of </p><p>hoofs on the level stretches; the cool, fresh breezes </p><p>of early summer—all these various little sounds </p><p>combined in a pleasant, unobtrusive symphony that </p><p>lulled the tired senses of the elderly passenger, and </p><p>soothed him into a state of peaceful, care-free, rever- </p><p>ent happiness. </p><p> Beyond lay The Plateau, a flattened knoll of some</p><p>five acres in expanse, toward which the road wound </p><p>in tortured undulations between other and lesser </p><p>knolls. As they neared their destination, driver </p><p>and passenger became aware of a high stone wall </p><p>completely surrounding the estate on The Plateau; </p><p>and when they had approached closely to the en- </p><p>trance gate, they saw that the top of the wall itself </p><p>was prickly with broken glass set in cement. </p><p> The main port of entry appeared to be a tall, iron</p><p>door set flush in the wall, and Ben sought the bell </p><p>affixed to the wall next to it. He pressed the button, </p><p>and then drew back a trifle nervously, and stood </p><p>abreast with Mason, who waited to be admitted. </p><p> Almost at once a small wicket, head high, was</p><p>drawn back from within, and a stolid face with </p><p>heavy lidded eyes appeared in the opening and </p><p>regarded them passively. </p><p> “Well?” challenged the watchman belligerently,</p><p>“What’s your business?”</p><p> “I’d like to see the Doctor,” said Mason, passing</p><p>his card through the wicket. “Take him my card, </p><p>please.” </p><p> "Wait!” said the guard, and closed the wicket in</p><p>the door. </p><p> “See!” whispered Ben triumphantly. “'What did</p><p>I tell you? At night you’d get no answer a’tall, </p><p>’less you tried to get over the wall, ’n’ then the </p><p>answer’d be buckshot most likely.” </p><p> There was the sound as of an iron bolt with-</p><p>drawn, and the heavy door swung inward. </p><p> “Come in!” said the guard, taking Mason’s bag.</p><p>“The Doctor’ll see you at once!” And to Ben, who </p><p>would have followed, “NoI You can’t come in! See </p><p>the sign ‘Private’?” He closed the door in the face </p><p>of the disappointed hackman. </p><p> The residence was set back at some little distance</p><p>within the gate, and as Mason traversed the gravel </p><p>path to it with his guide, he glanced with interest </p><p>about the enclosure. By now, a thousand questions </p><p>had Sprung to mind, elicited by his unusual recep- </p><p>tion, by that forbidding wall and medieval gate, by </p><p>the strange-looking buildings just beyond the resi- </p><p>dence, and by the house itself, drab and repellent in </p><p>the bright sunshine of the summer morning. </p><p> He followed the guard up a short flight of four</p><p>steps, and then, at a gesture from the man, pre- </p><p>ceded him through the vestibule, and stopped on </p><p>perceiving the subject of his visit. </p><p>A Good Reception From Dr. Santarti </p><p>ON the threshold of a low-raftered sitting </p><p>room, which was sumptuously furnished </p><p>around a principal color motif of mahogany, </p><p>stood Doctor Santurn, with hand extended. </p><p>“Gary!” he exclaimed delightedly, hurrying for- </p><p>BLASPHEMERS’ PLATEAU </p><p>ward to shake Mason’s hand and pat him on the </p><p>shoulder. “You’re more welcome than I can say. </p><p>.When did you arrive?” </p><p> “Last night,” said Mason dryly. “But they told</p><p>me-” </p><p> “Enough I” cried the Doctor contritely. “Hoist by</p><p> my own petard! This red tape with which I am</p><p> forced to surround myself seems to have snared</p><p> me badly if it deprived me of your company last</p><p> night. Of all the people I’ve longed to see! How</p><p> much time have you?” he broke off.</p><p> “All there is,” declared Mason leisurely. “My</p><p>last book is now on the presses, and I’m at ‘loose </p><p>ends’ for a while.” He regarded his old friend </p><p>closely. </p><p> “I’m just 'sizing you up,’ ” he said, “to see what</p><p> ravages the years have wrought.”</p><p> “And you find—?” asked the Doctor.</p><p> Few. You’re still slight. You always were</p><p>more ethereal than physical, I recall. Those spec- </p><p>tacle lenses are just a trifle thicker—a natural </p><p>thing for a bookworm. Same amount of hair, </p><p>nearer white than gray,” patting his own thinned </p><p>out crop ruefully, “and the same old world-defying </p><p>twirl to those distinctive moustaches of yours. On </p><p>the whole, I should say the years have treated you </p><p>kindly.” </p><p> “And you, too,” rejoined the Doctor. “I’m more</p><p>overjoyed every second, that you can make a long </p><p>visit with me. I’ll have you settled all ship-shape </p><p>and proper in short order.” </p><p> He picked up a felt hammer and smote a huge</p><p>gong with the mallet, the mellow, booming note </p><p>instantly summoning a bland and imperturbable </p><p>Japanese. </p><p> “Suki,” said the Doctor, “you will prepare the</p><p>south bedchamber for Mr. Mason and make him so </p><p>comfortable that he won’t want to leave in a hurry. </p><p>Take his bag up now.” </p><p> A mirthless smile appeared and disappeared so</p><p>quickly on Suki’s face that Mason almost doubted </p><p>he had seen it. </p><p> “If you can withstand the pressure of your curi-</p><p> osity,” said the Doctor, “save your questions until</p><p> later, until you orientate yourself. I suppose you’d</p><p> like to make the rounds with me?”</p><p> “Surely!” said Mason. “Is that the library be-</p><p>yond?” </p><p> “You scent books as unerringly as a setter its</p><p>quarry,” smiled the Doctor. “Very well. First the </p><p>library.” He drew Mason to the door at the far end </p><p>of the sitting room. </p><p> “Here are some thousands of volumes,” said the</p><p>Doctor, “and every one earns its keep. Your own </p><p>archaeology series has its own niche of honor, and </p><p>is exempt from the rules for a book’s admission </p><p>here.” </p><p> “Rules?” asked Mason, puzzled.</p><p> “Certainly. We have no room for any hut books</p><p>of science here, and new books, at that. As soon </p><p>as a new volume comes out that supersedes or dis- </p><p>proves an old one, out goes the old! With one other </p><p>exception-Ah! You’ve come to it!” as Mason, </p><p>■who had been browsing at random among the for- </p><p>midable array of tomes stopped before a section in </p><p>the far corner of the room. </p><p> “Why, what’s this, Oliver?” cried Mason in as-</p><p>tonishment. “Books on religion! The ‘Koran,’ </p><p>‘Holy Bible,’ ‘Oriental and Occidental Beliefs,’ ‘Su- </p><p>perstitions,’ ‘Agnosticism,’ ‘Bhuddistic Philosophy.’ </p><p>I m quite astounded! I had no idea that you were so </p><p>interested in theology and religion generally.” </p><p>Doctor Santurn’s eyes gleamed oddly behind the </p><p>shielding lenses of his heavy spectacles. </p><p> So much so, Gary, that all my work revolves</p><p>about my personal beliefs. I am attempting to </p><p>throw new light on Immortality and the Resurrec- </p><p>tion via the laboratory route.” </p><p>Going Through the Laboratory and Meeting the </p><p>Assistants </p><p>MASON was conscious of a twinge of fear for </p><p>his old friend’s sanity, and scrutinized his </p><p>face closely, hopefully seeking the clue to </p><p>some jest; but finding the Doctor in serious mood, </p><p>he forced himself to speak casually. </p><p> “What luck, Oliver?” he asked</p><p>“Some,” confessed the Doctor. “Considerable. </p><p>In fact, almost more than you will be able to as- </p><p>similate or credit for some time. But enough of this </p><p>mysticism! We can return here later. Come with </p><p>me, if you will, and acclimate yourself to the atmos- </p><p>phere up here on The Plateau.”</p><p> He led the way through a short hallway, passing</p><p> the foot of a staircase which ran to the upper floor.</p><p> ^ “Living quarters are upstairs,” he explained.</p><p> “The kitchen is back here, to one. side, where Suki</p><p> reigns unmolested. The main laboratory is in the</p><p> rear extension on the other side. We’ll leave that</p><p> until this evening. Just now let us visit the indi-</p><p> vidual workshops.”</p><p> They left the house by the front way, following</p><p> the gravel path around the side and to the rear, to</p><p> the first of three squat, gray buildings. This one</p><p> was surmounted by a cylindrical brick tower, fully</p><p> thirty feet in height, and this, in turn, was topped</p><p> by a sixty-foot mast, carefully braced, and guyed</p><p> to cement blocks set in the ground itself on either</p><p> side of the edifice. A similar mast rose from the</p><p> ground a hundred feet away, and between the two</p><p> depended the strands of a cage type of radio an-</p><p> tenna.</p><p> “This is the electro-physical laboratory,” explain-</p><p> ed the Doctor, as he opened the door and led the way</p><p> in.</p><p> “Hello Stevens!” he said, “what are you up to</p><p>now?” </p><p> A pleasant-faced, clean shaven man of middle age,</p><p> with a scholarly stoop to his shoulders, rose from</p><p> the laboratory stool on which he had been perched,</p><p> intent on his work. He kept his hand on a knob-</p><p> like contrivance connected with a peculiar type of</p><p> galvanometer and some other, unfamiliar apparatus,</p><p> and shut off a small, almost noiseless alternator,</p><p> the armature of which continued to turn for almost</p><p> a half minute after the circuit had been opened, so</p><p> great had been its speed.</p><p> Doctor Santum performed the introduction.</p><p> “You can speak freely in front of Mr. Mason,”</p><p>he advised. </p><p>" “I am progressing rapidly,” reported Stevens, </p><p>“but I feel somehow that the plasma is contamin- </p><p>660	AMAZING</p><p>ated. The vibratory rate is lower than I expected. </p><p>There’s resistance somewhere.” </p><p> “I’ll see that Bridges makes up a fresh supply</p><p>for you,” the Doctor assured him. He turned to </p><p>Mason. “We’re just arriving at the responsive </p><p>vibratory rate of blood plasma,” and, seeing the </p><p>archaeologist’s look of incredulity, he continued, </p><p>“No. We’re not delirious. Come along.” </p><p> The second building was a replica of the first</p><p>laboratory, externally; but it lacked the tower and </p><p>radio mast. Doctor Santurn rapped at the door. </p><p> “All right, Bridges?” he called. “Sometimes he</p><p>resents intrusion at a critical moment,” he explained </p><p>in an aside before the door opened. </p><p> A bald, weazoned and swarthy individual in a</p><p>grayish smock appeared in the doorway and </p><p>glanced at their feet immediately. </p><p> “You’re all right, Doctor; but I’ll have to get a</p><p> pair of rubbers for this gentleman.” He acknowl-</p><p> eged the introduction to Mason, excused himself for</p><p> a moment, and returned at once with a heavy pair</p><p> of rubbers. Mason put them on, wondering at the</p><p> thick, cushiony, spring-rubber treads.</p><p> “Unlike the other mosques,” explained the Doctor</p><p> with a curious little laugh, “we require you to put</p><p> on footgear before entering at this shrine of</p><p> Bridges!”</p><p> “Move lightly!” cautioned the little man. “Come</p><p>in!” </p><p>Description of the Work </p><p>ROWS on rows of kegs and vats lined the </p><p>walls, huge containers of chemical reagents </p><p>from which the smaller stock bottles in their </p><p>racks were evidently replenished. The glitter of </p><p>glassware, grotesquely shaped flasks and tubes, the </p><p>sheen of lacquered brass, scores of test tubes in </p><p>serried array in racks, an indefineable odor of com- </p><p>mingled gases, gave to the room the atmosphere of </p><p>a Merlin’s retreat. </p><p> “We do things in ai wholesale way,” explained</p><p>Bridges. "We can perform almost any sort of bio- </p><p>chemical experiment here, from the infinitesimally </p><p>small to those requiring a hundredweight or more </p><p>of materials. There’s a bacterial incubator in that </p><p>corner, and a refrigerator in this—duplicates of </p><p>those in the ‘zoo.’ ” </p><p> “Electrically controlled,” supplemented the Doc-</p><p> tor. “Most of our heating and all our lighting</p><p> comes on those wires strung on the poles you passed</p><p> on the road coming up here. The town beyond sup-</p><p> plies us with current, and keeps the meter at their</p><p> end of our private line, so that the total current con-</p><p> sumption is recorded there, no matter what new de-</p><p> vices we hook on here. It keeps inspectors from</p><p> coming up here constantly, and incidentally excludes</p><p> them from a glimpse of affairs that do not concern</p><p> them. Naturally, I pay well for the privacy.”</p><p> He approached the workbench whereon reposed</p><p>the bulkiest microscope Mason had ever seen. It </p><p>rested under a glass bell on a rubber pad. </p><p> “How far have you gotten, Bridges?” asked his</p><p>chief. </p><p> Bridges waved a hand at a row of stoppered test</p><p>tubes containing various colored fluids. </p><p> “.The solutions are still settling, Doctor. That is</p><p>STORIES </p><p>why I wanted to have you avoid all unnecessary, </p><p>jarring. The qualitative analysis is completed* </p><p>‘Quantitative’ will be finished by this evening. </p><p>When Stevens checks up with me tonight, I’ll make </p><p>a leukocyte for you 1” </p><p> Mason gasped audibly, and Doctor Santurn turned</p><p> to regard him with a self-satisfied smile.</p><p> “Are you astounded?” I assure you we’re not</p><p>trying to ‘pull your leg.’ To paraphrase old Shakes- </p><p>peare, ‘There are more things on The Plateau,’ </p><p>Gary, ‘than you ever dreamt of in your phil- </p><p>osophy.’ ” </p><p> “I don’t believe what I’ve heard!” vociferated</p><p>Mason stoutly. “How can I? Such things are pre- </p><p>posterous! Do you mean to tell me-?” </p><p> “Not a thing!” said Doctor Santurn. “Tonight</p><p>you shall see. At present I want you to steep a bit </p><p>longer. Let us go over to see Johnssen.” </p><p>What the Village Says About It All </p><p>EXCEEDINGLY bewildered, a trifle loathe to </p><p>leave the fascination of the bio-chemical lab- </p><p>oratory, Mason followed after the Doctor, </p><p>and with him kept to the path, to the last of the </p><p>three one-room buildings that lay to the rear of </p><p>the residence. </p><p> “Here we are!” said the Doctor, passing with</p><p>Mason through the door. “This place houses our </p><p>menagerie and equarium.” </p><p> “Then it’s true!” exclaimed Mason, recalling the</p><p> innkeeper’s story.</p><p> “What is?” asked the Doctor.</p><p> “One of the rumors the village is circulating</p><p>about you.” </p><p> “Is it a crime to possess a private collection?”</p><p> asked the Doctor, ironically.</p><p> “No-o.”</p><p> “Here’s Johnssen,” interrupted the Doctor.</p><p> A huge man approached them—a man perhaps</p><p>fifty years of age, yet whose full head of ash blond </p><p>hair, unlined, ruddy face and keen, sea-green eyes </p><p>gave the impression of a remarkable state of preser- </p><p>vation. </p><p> “What is new here?” asked the Doctor.</p><p> “We need a new thermostat for the primate’s</p><p>cage,” said Johnssen, the words rumbling slowly </p><p>and deeply in his throat. “Our youngster coughed </p><p>once or twice last evening. It was chilly, if you </p><p>remember, and I’m afraid he caught a cold. The </p><p>old thermostat sticks, somewhere around seventy, </p><p>and I’d like to get up to about ninety-five for emer- </p><p>gencies.” </p><p>“Are you referring to that orang?” asked Mason. </p><p> “Yes,” said Johnssen, “the devil! For a two-</p><p>year-old specimen born and brought up in captivity, </p><p>one would think he’d be up to the usual monkey </p><p>tricks. Not he! He sits there quietly and watches, </p><p>watches^—” </p><p> “Born and brought up here?” asked Mason of the</p><p>Doctor. </p><p>“That is correct. He’s always been an orphan.” </p><p> “Cryptic, as most of the things I hear,” retorted</p><p> Mason, a trifle impatiently. “I simply can’t contain</p><p> myself much longer. What is this all about?”</p><p>He leaned over the guard rail built around a huge </p><p>BLASPHEMERS' PLATEAU. </p><p>661 </p><p>tank set into the floor, and partitioned off into num- </p><p>erous smaller sections, each of which contained a </p><p>fish or small amphibian. He waved a hand at the </p><p>cages set about the walls, the orang being the larg- </p><p>est of the various occupants. </p><p> “Where are the lions and tigers? The ones the</p><p>villagers claim to have heard?” asked Mason. </p><p> “So long as they didn’t claim actually to have</p><p>seen them," said the Doctor, “my faith in the yokels </p><p>is unshaken. They merely hear the sounds of cer- </p><p>tain local insects and birds amplified and sent out </p><p>through the horn in the tower in order to test the </p><p>attraction of the sounds for similar species. We </p><p>occasionally use a radio decoy, so to speak, in testing </p><p>our transmitter. Also, we convert various forms </p><p>of radiant energy into ‘radio’ equivalents, and try </p><p>them out too, and much noise results. We have actu- </p><p>ally transmitted the equivalent of radium ‘gamma’ </p><p>rays, the various waves found in polarized light </p><p>and in X-rays, as well as the usual radio waves at </p><p>the other end of the scale, which reach into the </p><p>thousands of meters. </p><p>_ “To get back to this collection, however,” he con- </p><p>tinued, “I tell you truthfully that every one of the </p><p>specimens you see here was born on the premises!” </p><p> “That python?”</p><p> “Almost three years ago, and he’s as big as the</p><p>usual forty or fity year old specimen,” the Doctor </p><p>assured him. </p><p> “The badger, the lemur, and that brown toad?”</p><p>persisted Mason. </p><p> “Everyone of them!”</p><p> “I give up!” confessed Mason.</p><p> “You had better, until after luncheon, Gary,” ad-</p><p>vised the Doctor. “Come along, Johnssen! It’s </p><p>time to eat.” </p><p> The three men left the miniature zoo and aquari-</p><p>um, and strolled back to the house together, where </p><p>Stevens and Bridges joined them shortly. </p><p>Synthetic Snakes </p><p>SUKI served them deftly and silently while they </p><p>conversed about the topics nearest to their </p><p>hearts. The talk was most amazing to Mason,</p><p>who was reluctant to appear gullible. </p><p> “Mason, here, is an old college chum of mine,”</p><p>explained the Doctor. “After dabbling in science, </p><p>he commenced on theology, and then, by easy stages </p><p>drifted into archaeology in order to substantiate for </p><p>himself some of the beliefs he had picked up. As </p><p>for me, you see how I have departed from the paths </p><p>of ‘goodness.’ You needn’t hesitate to speak frankly </p><p>before our friend here. He’ll get the general import </p><p>of your remarks. He’s kept up with events in the </p><p>scientific world—the known scientific world,” he </p><p>amended. </p><p> Stevens began.</p><p> “Have you ever heard of a radio wave measuring</p><p>one meter?" </p><p> “Surely!” said Mason affably.</p><p> “One of a millimeter?” persisted Stevens.</p><p> “Not in radio work, though probably some of the</p><p>radium wave emanations are shorter than that.” </p><p> Have you ever heard of a quadrillimeter or a</p><p>pentillimeter?” </p><p> “Get 021 with you!” said Mason with some asper-</p><p>ity. “There are no such words or measurements. </p><p>You’re making game of me!” </p><p> Doctor Santurn smiled, the swarthy, weazened</p><p>Bridges chuckled, and Johnssen rumbled mirth- </p><p>fully. </p><p> Bridges took up the cudgels.</p><p> “Will synthetic gin produce the ‘D.T.V, to you^</p><p>knowledge," he asked slyly. </p><p> “Very likely," snapped Mason, on guard.</p><p> “Then a man who has taken sufficient synthetic</p><p>liquor over a long enough period of time should see </p><p>synthetic snakes and animals, shouldn't he?” </p><p>“Clever!” jeered Mason. “Synthetic jnakes! </p><p>Fancy them!" </p><p> “No. Don’t fancy them. They exist. You’ve seen</p><p>one yourself.” </p><p> “What! This is too thick for me!” cried Mason;</p><p>but they gave him no mercy. </p><p> “It’s your turn, Johnssen,” said the Chief.</p><p> “Do you remember the ancient myth about Min-</p><p>erva springing forth full-fledged from the head of </p><p>Jupiter?” </p><p> “Yes—well?”</p><p> “Of course it’s a myth,” conceded Johnssen,</p><p>“But it’s not so far from what might be possible.” </p><p>Mason extended his cigar-case around the table. </p><p>“The cigars are ‘on me’, gentlemen. I assure you </p><p>they contain no hasheesh or other substance calcu- </p><p>lated to encourage your fabrications. Miinchhausen </p><p>himself would feel abashed in your presence. </p><p> His table-mates laughed in good spirits at his in-</p><p>credulity as they rose to go back to their separate </p><p>tasks, and to Mason there was something forbid- </p><p>dingly convincing in the fact that not one of them </p><p>had attempted to bolster his argument for; argu- </p><p>ment's sake. </p><p>The Nitrogen Cycle </p><p>THE sun had descended through its arc during </p><p>the afternoon, sending, through the red, </p><p>stained-glass panels of the westerly windows </p><p>of the library, queer, bloody mottlings on the backs </p><p>of the books that lined the walls, as Mason and the </p><p>Doctor discussed the work on The Plateau. </p><p> “Gary, do I appear rational to you?” the Doctor</p><p>had asked. </p><p> “Your question implies some self-doubt as to your</p><p>own sanity, I presume. Judging fx-om externals, and </p><p>as a layman, I can truthfully say you appear noth- </p><p>ing out of the ordinary. Your manner of speech, </p><p>however, has disturbed me somewhat; but on the </p><p>whole I’d say you'd pass as nothing worse than </p><p>slightly eccentric.” </p><p> “Ah!” the Doctor had said. “But after I have</p><p>proceeded a little, you’ll think differently, no doubt. </p><p>Shall I start with fundamentals?” </p><p> “Do!”</p><p> And then the biologist had entered on the weird-</p><p>est and most unforseen harangue that it had even </p><p>been Mason’s lot to attend. </p><p> “Have you ever heard of the ‘nitrogen cycle,’</p><p>where the element nitrogen, ‘fixed’ by bacteria on </p><p>grass roots, is ingested by cattle, turned into pro- </p><p>teins, eaten by humans, and returned again to soil </p><p>and air, and so on ad infinitum?” </p><p> “Surely,” said Mason, “That’s elementary.”</p><p>“That’s Immortality!” corrected Doctor Santurn. </p><p>“Nitrogen immortality, and just as demonstratable </p><p>in every element. </p><p> “Nitrogen will always be nitrogen so long as the</p><p>662 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>orbits of the electrons in its atom remain undis- </p><p>turbed. A change or a disturbance of the electrons </p><p>will transform it into something else; perhaps into </p><p>heavier or lighter nitrogen, perhaps into an entirely </p><p>different substance. I know that to be true of every </p><p>element. </p><p> “Now we take a big jump, and consider a human</p><p>being just before ‘death’ occurs. </p><p> “The blood courses through the vascular system,</p><p>nourishing the tissues. Then the vital impulse </p><p>ceases. The circulation stops. The tissue cells, </p><p>starved for oxygen and nourishment, begin to dis- </p><p>integrate into their inert, protoplasmic elements. </p><p> “Electronic activity in the individual atoms, how-</p><p>ever, goes on forever, despite the gross dissolution </p><p>and decay of the body. The elementary matter of </p><p>which the body is composed is indestructible no </p><p>matter what form the body ultimately attains in the </p><p>process of disintegration. </p><p> “That’s Nature’s method of analysis, of reducing</p><p>a body into the individual and original elements </p><p>which compose it. Does she waste these elements? </p><p> “She does not! Of course not! She borrows a few</p><p>carbon molecules here, a little calcium there, per- </p><p>haps some sulphur and hydrogen elsewhere. Then </p><p>she combines them in proper proportion, kindles </p><p>them with the magic wand of radiant energy, and </p><p>presto! A new living organism is in our midst—* </p><p>perhaps an amoeba, or one of the yeasts, mayhap </p><p>bird or beast, or even a new human being!” </p><p> “You mean,” said Mason intensely interested,</p><p>“That Death merely disarranges the atomic com- </p><p>position of a body by interfering with the vibratory </p><p>rate of its electrons, and then, by a rearrangement </p><p>of the chemical elements of the deceased, and a new </p><p>vibratory impulse, Nature creates a new form of </p><p>life from the old?” </p><p> “Essentially, yes!” agreed the Doctor. “Only</p><p>your definitions of Death, Nature, and Life mean </p><p>separate things to you; whereas to me they mean </p><p>God. Now, right here, I am about to utter what </p><p>may sound like blasphemy to those ears of yours </p><p>which drank in too much in those theology lectures </p><p>of long ago, when you were just a plastic and im- </p><p>pressionable boy. </p><p>The Doctor and His Visitor Disagree </p><p>**1TP 1 can do these things—if I can reduce an </p><p>N range the same elements so they’ll again be </p><p>JL organism to its components and then rear- </p><p>instinct with life, will I not be God myself?” </p><p> “I see,” said Mason, his voice bitter with disap-</p><p>pointment. “ ‘Me und Gott’ as the Kaiser once re- </p><p>marked. You’re a megalomaniac.” </p><p> “Your reactions do you credit, Gary,” said Doc-</p><p>tor Santurn, shrugging his shoulders apologetically. </p><p>“But don’t misunderstand me. I am not, I have no </p><p>desire to be—Divine. I am just an inchworm meas- </p><p>uring its length against the unknown end of </p><p>Science’s yardstick, in an attempt to reach a certain </p><p>goal.” </p><p> “A non-existent goal!” snorted Mason disgusted-</p><p>ly. </p><p> “I desire to prove,” continued the Doctor, “that</p><p>spiritual Immortality does not exist, because physi- </p><p>cal, atomic Immortality precludes the possibility. </p><p>And that goes for Resurrection, too. A man’s body </p><p>dies, disintegrates, and his atoms are used again to </p><p>build other forms. His ‘spirit’ is merely the vibra- </p><p>tion which stimulates the electrons in their orbits.” </p><p>“Yes?” sneered Mason skeptically. </p><p> The Doctor flushed, but continued in the same,</p><p>pedantic manner. </p><p> “In radio work there are two sorts of waves we</p><p>recognize; the ‘damped,’ or extinguished type, and </p><p>the continuous or undamped variety. </p><p> “Mortal life is subject to damped impulses. The</p><p>damping of vibrations may take place in a single </p><p>cell in an hour; in man, a vast collection of cells, it </p><p>may require ‘threescore and ten’, or, in the case of </p><p>our old friend Methuselah, nine hundred and sixty </p><p>three years. Barring accident, and applying a </p><p>proper, continuous vibratory impulse to man, we </p><p>should be enabled to keep him going indefinitely. </p><p> “I am not interested in that aspect of Immortal-</p><p>ity, my friend. It would interfere with the economic </p><p>scheme of things. But I am desirous of showing </p><p>that there is no ‘spirit’ that persists beyond man’s </p><p>dissolution. Death merely damps his vital vibra- </p><p>tions, extinguishes the impulse, so to speak. Only </p><p>his molecules, atoms and electrons live on forever.” </p><p>He fell silent, lost in reverie; and Mason wrapped </p><p>in horrified speculation, did not disturb him. At </p><p>length he broke the silence. </p><p> “And when you demonstrate your thesis to Man-</p><p>kind, Oliver, what do you expect to accomplish?” </p><p>Doctor Santurn brought up his wandering </p><p>thoughts with a jerk, recollected time, place and </p><p>adversary, and formulated his answer. </p><p> “Ah! Gary! I want to wipe out religion, the</p><p>curse of humanity! I want men to live their years </p><p>with the knowledge that what they waste here can- </p><p>not, by any form of expiation, be made up in the </p><p>‘Hereafter.’ That ‘Heaven’ holds no greater reward </p><p>than they are capable of achieving right here in the </p><p>one existence; and that ‘Hell’ is a consciousness of </p><p>error. When there are no barriers of religion be- </p><p>tween man and man, such as differences in faith </p><p>now present, then the Brotherhood of Man will have </p><p>arrived.” </p><p> “You forget one thing,” interrupted Mason,</p><p>“Man’s tendency to turn for assistance in time of </p><p>stress to a Higher Power.” </p><p>The Doctor Not An Atheist </p><p>« 71 IT AN is a worm!” retorted Doctor Santurn. </p><p> VI &lt;,Do you actually believe Go(1 guides the</p><p>I? X destinies of every individual bit of living </p><p>protoplasm? He does, yes, in a wholesale way. He </p><p>leaves the inconsequential details to the commun- </p><p>ity. He endows us with knowledge sufficient for our </p><p>well-being, and with a sense of ethics for the sake </p><p>of society. He gives us the rudiments, the formulae </p><p>for successful living, and then washes His hands of </p><p>us, knowing that our neighbors will reward or pun- </p><p>ish us as we deserve.” </p><p> “You are not exactly an atheist,” said Mason,</p><p>puzzled, “And yet- </p><p> “I? An ntheist? Hardly, Gary. I do believe this</p><p>much: that a Great Power created the earth and all </p><p>that is therein. But He or It merely supplied the </p><p>crude elements that might still be found to-day if </p><p>all living matter were reduced to its lowest common </p><p>components. </p><p> “Then He planted a cell here, another there, and</p><p>gave them the initial impulse that made them in- </p><p>'BLASPHEMERS’ PLATEAU </p><p>663 </p><p>stinct with what you call ‘life’. The rest He left to </p><p>Evolution, which adapted them to changing condi- </p><p>tions and environments through the aeons.” </p><p> “If I understand you correctly," rejoined Mason,</p><p>“Evolution, Nature, call it whatever you will, is the </p><p>only true minister of the Deity?” </p><p>: Doctor Santurn nodded, pleased. </p><p>: “Call it that, or call it a physical, chemical, or a </p><p>mechanical force, so long as you leave out all ref- </p><p>erence to the spiritual.” </p><p>The Effect On the Visitor, Mason </p><p>SOMETHING clutched at Mason’s heart then, </p><p>perhaps the memory of his father, long ago </p><p>on a Thanksgiving Day saying grace over the </p><p>festive board of the little New England farmhouse. </p><p>He thought too, of his mother, laid away to the ac- </p><p>companiment of a clerical assurance of her spiritual </p><p>persistence; of his own wedding and the old phrase, </p><p>“Whom God hath joined, let no man put asunder”; </p><p>and of the same dear wife’s promise, just prior to </p><p>her decease, to wait for him on the ‘Other Side’. </p><p> But Oliver Santurn would deny these blessed</p><p>things to mankind, he thought bitterly. He would </p><p>rob humanity of the fruits, and leave them the </p><p>husks. </p><p> It was all too preposterous, of course! Neither</p><p>the Doctor nor any other man could compass these </p><p>wild visions and bring them to fruition; every wail- </p><p>ing soul, outraged, from the time of Cro-Magnon </p><p>on downward through the ages, would frustrate </p><p>them. </p><p> It did serve to show him, however, a cold and</p><p>sinister picture of one whom he had thought of </p><p>warmly as a friend for almost forty years. </p><p>Some of the Wonders! </p><p>DOCTOR Santurn’s main laboratory in the ex- </p><p>tension to the rear of the residence was </p><p>brilliantly illuminated by searchlights set </p><p>well away in the corners, so as to be non-interfering </p><p>magnetically with the delicate apparatus assembled </p><p>on the insulated table in the center. The clear, white </p><p>beams were directed against a cluster of parabolic </p><p>reflectors, suspended from the domed ceiling, </p><p>which focused the light upon the table below. </p><p> The room itself was somewhat of a composite of</p><p>the three Mason had visited in the morning, and </p><p>was reserved for the purpose of correlating the sep- </p><p>arate facts ascertained in the individual depart- </p><p>ments, and applying them in actual experiment. </p><p> The Doctor and his assistants were garbed in</p><p>sterile white surgeons’ garb, gauze-masked and rub- </p><p>ber-gloved, and they had provided the visitor with </p><p>a similar outfit. He now stood listening attentively, </p><p>to the Chief’s remarks. </p><p> “The slide is sterile, as you see, having been</p><p>carefully subjected to heavy, moist heat pressure </p><p>in the sterilizer for thirty minutes. The microscope </p><p>shows it to be free from organisms. The instru- </p><p>ments Bridges is using have also been carefully </p><p>sterilized. Watch him carefully as I call off rates </p><p>and quantities!" </p><p> Under what appeared to Mason as the central lens</p><p>of a quadruplex microscope, Bridges placed another </p><p>sterile glass slide, and to it transferred an infinites- </p><p>imal speck of some element. The little man now </p><p>jbent to a stereoscopic eyepiece, and with a delicate </p><p>stylus tapered down to the invisibility of a Wollas- </p><p>ton wire, teased and crushed the speck until Mason,' </p><p>could no longer discern it. </p><p> “He is breaking down that particle into its basic</p><p>crystals,” murmured the Doctor in explanation. “It </p><p>is an easier method—arrived at by us after con- </p><p>siderable research—to use separate and individual </p><p>crystals whose atomic weights we know, than to </p><p>add or subtract via the scales method. We used to, </p><p>at first; but now we have listed the exact weights </p><p>of basic crystals.” </p><p> He turned towards Bridges. “Three!” he ordered.</p><p> At Bridges’ invitation, Mason peered through the</p><p>eyepiece, and taking the fine probe in his unprac- </p><p>ticed fingers, saw what appeared to be a telegraph </p><p>pole prodding at a great pile of small, white, gran- </p><p>ular boulders. There was a deep valley beyond the </p><p>mass, and across the gap lay three of the small </p><p>builders by themselves. </p><p> Again and again the Doctor called off substances</p><p>and^ quantities, until at last the requisite number of </p><p>various crystals had been assembled in an inert </p><p>mass on a fresh slide, a drop of clear blood serum </p><p>added, and the whole surrounded by an incredibly </p><p>thin iridium washer, and sealed by a cover glass. </p><p> Mason looked again through the quadruplex mic-</p><p>roscope and felt reassured that the mass was ac-</p><p>tually inert, a mound of chemicals in a puddle of </p><p>clear fluid. </p><p> “Your turn, Stevens!” called the Doctor. “Have</p><p>you found the rate?” </p><p> “Yes, Doctor. The wave is one hundred and five</p><p>pentjllimeters for human leukocytes. Various har- </p><p>monics will produce mammalian, piscatory, or ser- </p><p>pentine varieties. Shall I proceed ?” </p><p> •‘By all means,” urged the Chief.</p><p>24 Steps of Amplification </p><p>A BANK of twenty-four vacuum tubes, some- </p><p>what resembling those used for radio pur- </p><p>poses, had been arranged at the end of the </p><p>table opposite the microscopical and chemical ap- </p><p>paratus; and to a metallic slab in their midst, </p><p>Bridges now carefully transferred the slide with </p><p>sterile tweezers. </p><p> Stevens then turned a milli-vernier lateral clamp</p><p>so that its edges made contact with the flat iridium </p><p>jvasher under the coverglass on the slide. </p><p> “With twenty four cascaded steps of radio fre-</p><p>quency amplification ahead of it,” explained </p><p>Stevens," and the contents of this slide acting as </p><p>the grid of the detector, a tremendous electronic </p><p>impulse can be imparted.” </p><p> He stepped to a corner of the room and wheeled</p><p>into position a squat carriage from which a heavily </p><p>insulated cable ran back to a special socket in the </p><p>wall. Upon the carriage rested a box-shaped piece </p><p>of apparatus the size of a large trunk, which </p><p>Stevens referred to as a “neo-split-wave radio trans- </p><p>mitter.” </p><p> “It’s just the reverse of the heterodyne principle,</p><p>you know," he explained. “It steps the wave down </p><p>as far as we want it, and we do need a very short </p><p>wave to compete with and surpass the gamma rays </p><p>of radium. Now we’re ready,” he said, focusing the </p><p>wave director toward an almost invisible loop aerial </p><p>on the receptor, and adjusting his controls. </p><p> “Six and eighty two hundredths of a second</p><p>664 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>should be sufficient exposure,” he remarked, setting </p><p>the electric, split-second automatic stop. </p><p> “Stand back, please!”</p><p> As the little group moved slightly to one side of</p><p>the path of the ray, Stevens closed the primary cir- </p><p>cuit of the transmitter. </p><p> A weird, horrific screech filled the room, as</p><p>though an invisible Twentieth Century Limited ex- </p><p>press train had applied its brakes suddenly to </p><p>screaming steel rails. All the Jinnis of Hell to- </p><p>gether could hardly equal the terror of it, thought </p><p>Mason. </p><p>The Swan Song of a Vacuum Tube </p><p>AND then silence descended, broken only by </p><p>the faint, rattling, tinkle of broken glass fall- </p><p>ing somewhere inside the box on the carriage. </p><p> Steveus smiled.</p><p> “That was the swan-song of the transmitting</p><p>tube. Tubes always collapse under the strain when </p><p>used for a full exposure. We exhaust their three </p><p>years of possible usefulness in a few, hectic sec- </p><p>onds, and their elements shriek in protest as they </p><p>disintegrate.” </p><p> “Hurray!” interrupted Johnssen. “Bring the</p><p>slide back before our subject freezes to death. I’ll </p><p>have to warm it with a light bath and give it </p><p>oxygen.” </p><p> The slide was immediately and deftly transferred</p><p>back to its seat under the microscope lens, and </p><p>treated to a bath of light directed at it laterally, and </p><p>the cover glass lifted for an instant. </p><p> “You shall be the first to look, Gary,” directed</p><p>Doctor Santurn. “I think you know from observa- </p><p>tion how to focus the microscope. It is simply the </p><p>old type worked out to almost absolute perfection.” </p><p> Mason's eyes were affixed to the stereoscopic at-</p><p>tachment, the milli-vernier adjustment screw turn- </p><p>ing slowly between his fingers. </p><p> Back and forth, back and forth, he turned the</p><p>adjustment screw, raising and lowering the tube </p><p>columns until the field cleared. Then Mason’s hand </p><p>drew slowly away from the super-microscope. </p><p> He gave a startled cry.</p><p> “Good God, Oliver! Something’s moving! Skim-</p><p>ming about here and there in the drop of fluid! It </p><p>can’t be—it’s impossible!” </p><p> “Is it?” asked the Doctor testily. “I thought you</p><p>inspected every step of the process yourself.” </p><p> “I did—I did!” cried Mason excitedly, still watch-</p><p>ing the unicellular bit of life moving about in its </p><p>element. “Only this—” he turned and looked at the </p><p>silent group, with his arms stretched to them ap- </p><p>pealingly. </p><p> “This is no hoax, gentlemen? It isn’t an elaborate</p><p>farce at my expense? It’s true? Is it?” </p><p> One by one they gravely nodded affirmation of</p><p>the genuineness of what he had seen, and at last </p><p>he faltered a little, and breathing with difficulty </p><p>turned to the Doctor. </p><p> “I—I’m not well, Oliver. I’d like to rest a bit.</p><p>This thiiig has struck me all of a heap!” </p><p>More Scientific Miracles Told Of </p><p>IT seemed incredible to Mason that only twenty- </p><p>four hours’ earlier he had been seated with the </p><p>proprietor of The Travelers’ Hotel in the vil- </p><p>lage, laughing and conversing light-heartedly over </p><p>the whimsical absurdities, suspicions and super- </p><p>stitions of the natives, as related by the host. </p><p> That was another world, another existence as far</p><p>as the Poles away from this atmosphere of deadly, </p><p>calm, fixity of purpose with the destruction of man- </p><p>kind's beloved and familiar beliefs as its goal. </p><p> Again in the library, resting from the shock of</p><p>what he had witnessed in the laboratory, Mason sat </p><p>tete-d-tSte with the biologist and listened with </p><p>strained absorption to his friend’s remarks. </p><p>(“Friend? I’m not certain!” thought Mason.) </p><p> “What you saw performed, this evening,” the</p><p>Doctor was saying, “was the achievement of a goal </p><p>we have already reached by a slightly different and </p><p>easier method. You saw a single cell created. We </p><p>have gone further—much further. </p><p> “Every one of the fish and mammals in John-</p><p>ssen’s care was born in a similar manner. Only we </p><p>didn’t create them cell by cell. We merely obtained </p><p>the unfertilized fish roe, or reptilian eggs, or mam- </p><p>malian ova from various private aquaria and zoo-</p><p>logical collections all over the country, wherever a </p><p>female specimen had freshly expired or been killed. </p><p> “It is easier to start with the unfertilized primary</p><p>cell, actuate it in the laboratory, and permit its </p><p>gestation and growth thereafter in a natural man- </p><p>ner. </p><p> “Again—we have gone beyond even this. We</p><p>know the composition of the eggs and ova of more </p><p>than fifty varieties of organisms. We have dupli- </p><p>cated them successfully and actuated them with </p><p>vibratory impulses equivalent to the fertilization </p><p>and germination processes of ‘Nature’. We con- </p><p>trol the sex at will by limitation of the chromosomes </p><p>of the primary cell. In most respects, this method </p><p>is the simpler of the two we have worked out. </p><p> “The other method, of which you saw an ex-</p><p>ample tonight, is a step toward creating the individ- </p><p>ual tissues of the grown body. We have already </p><p>duplicated the main, or parenchyme elements of </p><p>several varieties of connective tissue—namely, </p><p>areolar, fibrous, elastic, reticular, and the like. </p><p> “Blood, however, presents a difficult problem, and</p><p>is taking longer to duplicate, because of the various </p><p>cellular elements in it which exist in changing pro- </p><p>portions. We’re getting there, though!” </p><p> “And if you do?” asked Mason, hanging on each</p><p>word of the highly technical description of the </p><p>Doctor’s work. </p><p> “‘And when we do’, you should have said,” re-</p><p>joined Doctor Santurn. </p><p> “When we do,” he continued, “we’ll use the hu-</p><p>man ovum now in Johnssen’s incubator, and ar- </p><p>tificially create a human being!” </p><p> “Damn your matter-of-fact confidence!” thought</p><p>Mason. </p><p> “Just now,” resumed the Doctor, “we want to be</p><p>able to duplicate every variety of human blood we </p><p>encounter in order to prepare for any emergency </p><p>we may encounter that may arise after the birth </p><p>of our subject. Transfusion, for instance.” </p><p> Mason shivered slightly.</p><p>A Discussion in Theology </p><p>IN his reverent delving into the archives of the </p><p>past, ’midst African sand dunes and buried </p><p>Greek and Roman cities, he had come across the </p><p>records of unspeakable practices, horrific and re-</p><p>BLASPHEMERS’ PLATEAU </p><p>665 </p><p>volting; but never had he sensed so sinister an aura </p><p>as that which surrounded the quiet-voiced, mild- </p><p>mannered scientist who droned of his hopes and ac- </p><p>complishments. </p><p> If only he had the desire to dedicate his brilliant</p><p>discoveries to the cure of disease, to the alleviation </p><p>of suffering, to the elevation of Mankind and the </p><p>.Glory of God! </p><p> But no! His purpose was to render null and void</p><p>all that had inspired faith in spiritual reality since </p><p>the dawn of human life on the earth. </p><p> “Your work is monstrous, Oliver!” he said.</p><p> “No matter how good your intentions may be, you</p><p>are preparing to foist on humanity something that </p><p>they will abominate!” </p><p> Doctor Santurn spoke with a tinge of sarcasm in</p><p>his voice, which was pitched slightly higher and </p><p>sounded somewhat strained. </p><p> “Since when are you a moralist, Gary?”</p><p> “Since this very moment, Oliver! You’ll knock</p><p>the props from under civilization and offer cold </p><p>consolation in return. The sort of Immortality you </p><p>believe in is no solace to the average man, even if </p><p>your theories are entirely correct—which I am not </p><p>prepared to admit.” </p><p> “Stuff and nonsense! Do you really suppose, if</p><p>you should die this minute, you’d go to a ‘Here- </p><p>after' clad in celestial habiliments, but still appear- </p><p>ing your present age—wrinkles, bald spot and all? </p><p>Have you ever thought seriously of it Gary? What </p><p>age would you be if you died and went to ‘Heaven’? </p><p>Would you dwell through Infinity agelessly, await- </p><p>ing Gabriel’s saxophone to clothe yourself again in </p><p>the mortal clay you had left behind? </p><p>' ‘You wouldn’t find it, Gary! Not on Resurrection </p><p>Day. You’d find that while you had strayed off, Na- </p><p>ture had borrowed some of your very material </p><p>molecules and employed them elsewhere in a moslj </p><p>useful manner. </p><p> “Then the only recourse left you, if there should</p><p>be a ‘You’, would be to appropriate unto yourself </p><p>the Oriental belief in reincarnation, find yourself a </p><p>new organism about to be born, and crawl into </p><p>swaddling clothes for a new start—perhaps as a </p><p>sacred cow, or a cat!</p><p> “Stuff and nonsense, Gary! How could you bring</p><p>yourself expediently to believe in a ‘heathen’ doc- </p><p>trine?” </p><p> “Stop—stop it!” cried Mason, feeling as if some</p><p>roiling hand had stirred up the mud of doubt on </p><p>these very questions which had always secretly </p><p>troubled him. </p><p> “On the other hand,” went on the Doctor, a#</p><p>though Mason had not spoken, “Consider these bene- </p><p>fits: Men and women born free of any taint— </p><p>physically free from blemish, and psychologically </p><p>exempt from the age-old inhibitions and fears that </p><p>hamper them to-day. ‘Religion’ is responsible, basic- </p><p>ally, for most of these psychic handicaps.” </p><p> “Will they all be soulless automatons?” inter-</p><p>rupted Mason, rallying again to the attack. “All of </p><p>one level of mediocrity or genius? All with the </p><p>same tastes, desires and capabilities? </p><p> “Granting your so-called ‘benefits’, what becomes</p><p>of man's age-old desire for perpetuation in the </p><p>traits of his children? What of his innate urge for </p><p>perpetuation after he ceases to walk among the liv- </p><p>ing?, </p><p> “Instead of a soul, you claim he becomes a com-</p><p>pletely damped impulse in the ether. Try and tell </p><p>men that, and see whether reason or instinct pre- </p><p>vails ! </p><p> “At your peril attempt to ram your ‘Brother-</p><p>hood of Man’ scheme down their throats in the man- </p><p>ner you propose. </p><p> “Oh, yes! Just try!”</p><p> But the Doctor merely laughed, refused to be</p><p>drawn into further argument, and prepared to re- </p><p>tire. </p><p>A Feeling of Repulsion Begins to Grow </p><p>TIME stood still, up there on The Plateau; and </p><p>the absence of newspapers, even of calendars, </p><p>had its effect on Mason who lapsed quickly </p><p>into the routine of the place. </p><p> Repelled by what he saw and heard, yet, never-</p><p>theless, fascinated by each step forward in the mon- </p><p>strous work, he spoke in a half-hearted manner of </p><p>taking his departure, only to comply with the Doc- </p><p>tor’s cynically veneered proposal that he “stick it </p><p>out.” </p><p> What he had witnessed during the first few hours</p><p>following his arrival had created within him a deep- </p><p>er repugnance than he had believed himself capable </p><p>of feeling. Gregarious by instinct, tolerant of the </p><p>foibles and failings of the gemis homo, and even </p><p>indulgent of some of them personally, Mason </p><p>brought to bear his best arguments to turn Doctor </p><p>Santurn aside from the accomplishment of what he </p><p>finally termed “Hellish desires.” </p><p> The biologist had indulged in another of his mild</p><p>laughs at that; but if he had proclaimed his inten- </p><p>tion at the top of his voice, it could not have served </p><p>better to convince Mason that wordy interference </p><p>would be futile. </p><p> For the first time the archaeologist became aware</p><p>of his own duality of nature. Ordinarily frank to </p><p>the utmost, more comfortable as donor than as sup- </p><p>plicant, there rose from his inner consciousness the </p><p>knowledge that he would travel devious and subtle </p><p>routes, if need he, to circumvent the Doctor. He was </p><p>no longer in doubt as to the man’s ability to create </p><p>at will, many varieties of organisms. </p><p> Johnssen’s charges became more numerous day</p><p>by day, and whatever had once been animated in the </p><p>laboratories on The Plateau was jealously guarded </p><p>and nurtured. </p><p> Each day had its definite assignment to be com-</p><p>pleted, the schedule being laid down on the preced- </p><p>ing evening; and as Mason contributed an appar- </p><p>ently eager curiosity, the Doctor and his staff soon </p><p>grew used to his appearance in this laboratory or </p><p>that. They even found amusement in directing him </p><p>to push this button or throw that switch, and watch- </p><p>ing his amazement at the results. </p><p> They were playing with the Higher Science, and</p><p>it is doubtful if they could have recalled the rudi- </p><p>mentary principles upon which their discoveries </p><p>were based, so accustomed had they become to </p><p>manipulation of their super-devices, and the per* </p><p>formance of their intricate experiments. </p><p> On the surface, Mason was apparently reconciled</p><p>to the projects which he watched grow to fruition, </p><p>from day to day. Within, however, his submerge^ </p><p>nature was slowly gaining the ascendency. </p><p> Calm, rational, well-balanced mentally, ordinarily,</p><p>666 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>he nevertheless felt at times a desire to seize some </p><p>convenient bludgeon and smash—smash to atoms </p><p>these unbelieveable devices which were to bring </p><p>grief to mankind. At such moments there seemed </p><p>to ring in his ears the cry, </p><p> “Sodom and Gomorrah! There are no righteous</p><p>here!” </p><p>Mason’s Mind Begins to Be Affected By What </p><p>He Has Seen </p><p>HAD he been possessed of an explosive, un- </p><p>der the stimulus of his hidden impulse he </p><p>might have been prompted to sacrifice </p><p>himself as a martyr for Humanity’s sake by reduc- </p><p>ing the laboratories and occupants into the particles </p><p>to which the Doctor was so fond of referring. </p><p>There was no opportunity for this, however, or </p><p>rather, at best he might be successful in destroying </p><p>Bridges’ laboratory alone, for inflammable material </p><p>in bulk was stored there. </p><p> Johnssen’s charges—especially the python and</p><p>the giant orang—came to mind as Mason pondered </p><p>on the possibility of using them as active instru- </p><p>ments of mischief; but no satisfactory method of </p><p>employing them as Frankensteins occurred to him. </p><p>He discarded the idea, for while he might account </p><p>for the artificial specimens in the zoo, and possibly </p><p>eliminate Johnssen, there would be left the other </p><p>laboratories, and the Doctor, Bridges and Stevens </p><p>with whom to reckon; to say nothing of Suki and </p><p>either of the watchmen. </p><p> Stevens, the youngest of the scientists, was pos-</p><p>sessed of so many likeable qualities, despite his </p><p>sacreligious work, that he was a thorn in Mason’s </p><p>conscience when the thought of murder came to </p><p>him. </p><p> But again a voice seemed to cry in Mason’s ear,</p><p> “Slay! Smight them hip and thigh! Spare not</p><p>one of the blasphemers 1” </p><p> Mason began spending much of his time in the</p><p>electro-physical laboratory, where he came to be </p><p>accepted by Stevens as a sincere searcher after </p><p>knowledge, and, as an intimate of his Chief’s, en- </p><p>titled to every courtesy and jonsideration. </p><p> Soon Stevens was permitting the older man to</p><p>assist in some of the work, and as time fled by, and </p><p>almost a month had elapsed since his arrival, Mason</p><p>came to acquire a fair working knowledge of the </p><p>operation of the equipment, without in the least at- </p><p>tempting to ascertain the underlying principles. </p><p> As each step was checked up here, Stevens would</p><p>demonstrate to Mason before presenting his findings </p><p>to the Doctor. </p><p> “You know,” he once remarked, placing on the</p><p>laboratory table a live rabbit that had been snared </p><p>by one of the watchmen, “that what is true of a </p><p>theorem can often be demonstrated conversely. For </p><p>instance, if we can create by one method, we should </p><p>be able to destroy by a diametrically opposite and </p><p>related method. We have made blood of many var- </p><p>ieties with this neo-wave-generator. </p><p> “It is equally possible to destroy the blood and</p><p>tissue elements by reversing the wave polarity by </p><p>means of this change-over switch. </p><p> “This experiment is entre nous, if you please. I</p><p>don’t think the Doctor would altogether approve; </p><p>but I should like to demonstrate to you what I </p><p>jnean. </p><p> “Observe this white rabbit—the fine, shell-like</p><p>pink of its ears, due to the coursing blood. I am go- </p><p>ing to use a negative and reversed harmonic for </p><p>rabbits’ blood haemoglobin. Watch!” </p><p> With Mason behind him, intent on his slightest</p><p>action, he closed the circuit with the director </p><p>focused on the rabbit. </p><p>Instantaneous Production of Anemia By Rays </p><p>THE loud, metallic screech, now familiar to </p><p>Mason, commenced and ceased almost in- </p><p>stantly, and now the rabbit gained his at- </p><p>tention. </p><p> To his amazement he saw its pinkish ears grow</p><p>paler, blanch to an opaque white, to the white of a </p><p>fish’s belly—to leprous white. The animal seemed </p><p>to shrink slightly, to breath with difficulty, all with- </p><p>in the compass of a minute. </p><p> “The subject,” announced Stevens in a satisfied</p><p>manner, “is dying of pernicious anaemia. At least, </p><p>I have employed a ray destructive to haemoglobin— </p><p>the red blood cells. If you were to take a specimen </p><p>of this rabbit’s blood over to Bridges, he could </p><p>show you under his microscope that practically all </p><p>the red blood corpuscles had been destroyed. I’d </p><p>rather you’d take my word for it and refrain from </p><p>asking him, as this side line is a little secret of my </p><p>own.”</p><p> Not again was Mason permitted to view a demon-</p><p>stration of the powers of the destructive wave; but </p><p>his eyes wandered often to the wave-changing de- </p><p>vice on the switchboard of the transmitter, as </p><p>Stevens busied himself with innumerable tasks. </p><p> Another week elapsed, during which time the con-</p><p>certed efforts of the scientists were devoted to a </p><p>duplication of the various principal cells of the </p><p>nervous system and brain. They worked with amaz- </p><p>ing speed and accuracy, did these men. </p><p> “It wouldn’t do, Gary,” Doctor Santurn re-</p><p>marked, “to bring that human ovum to life next </p><p>month, only to have it turn out an imbecile. I am </p><p>going to make sure there’ll be the nucleus of a </p><p>sound brain within its cranium after we bring it </p><p>into being.” </p><p> Mason smiled, despite the impulse to rend and</p><p>tear. </p><p> He could not, however, look into the Doctor’s eyes</p><p>for fear of disclosing his true feelings, as he mur- </p><p>mured false phrases of approbation. </p><p> Mason had learned to dissimulate.</p><p>The Horror Of It All Grows </p><p>W ORN and haggard from the conflict of </p><p>forces which raged within him, the elderly </p><p>archaeologist gave up all thought of the </p><p>outer world, his every desire centering on ac- </p><p>complishing the destruction of the work and work- </p><p>ers of the Plateau Laboratories. </p><p> He almost screamed aloud in horror at the arti-</p><p>ficial birth of the baby, which took place in Doctor </p><p>Santurn’s main laboratory a month later. </p><p> The ovum, which had been subjected to activating</p><p>treatment under the ray months before, and had </p><p>been in Johnssen’s incubator all this while, was </p><p>now a full-term foetus and needed but the final ex- </p><p>posure to the action of the ray to bring to life a. </p><p>lustily bawling youngster. </p><p>Before Johnssen, with almost maternal solid- </p><p>BLASPHEMERS’ PLATEAU </p><p>667 </p><p>tude, rushed it off to its incubator—the same, as a </p><p>matter of fact, that the orang had once occupied— </p><p>Doctor Santurn examined it carefully. </p><p> With an air of disappointment he finally turned</p><p>to his assistants and remarked, “There has been </p><p>some slight error of calculation. The infant is a </p><p>cretin. We shall be delayed with its brain develop- </p><p>ment until we have subjected it to radio-glandular </p><p>therapy for a while.” </p><p> Then, against his inner loathing to be present on</p><p>several succeeding occasions, Mason had witnessed </p><p>the delicate treatments which transformed the hid- </p><p>eous creature into a seraphic-faced, physically per- </p><p>fect specimen of babyhood—like the forced growth </p><p>of some ugly bulb under hothouse methods into a </p><p>blooming orchid of rare beauty. </p><p> Doctor Santurn, however, would not declare him-</p><p>self satisfied until he should have implanted a sec- </p><p>tion of brain tissue into the child's cranium, for </p><p>subjection to rapid growth by means of neo-wave </p><p>stimulation. </p><p> Mason had by now passed the bounds of rational</p><p>reasoning which might have led him to perceive the </p><p>valuable by-products of the biologist’s experiments, </p><p>the means for eradicating many of the woes and </p><p>much of the suffering of the peoples of the world. </p><p>He nursed his fear assiduously, on the Doctor’s </p><p>oft-repeated statement that he meant to use his dis- </p><p>coveries, not as a relief measure for “miserable </p><p>humanity,” but to destroy their “erroneous be- </p><p>lief” in the Divinity of Creation, and in Spiritual </p><p>Immortality. </p><p> Helplessly, desperately, Mason strove to stem the</p><p>tide of this blasphemy, but no opening presented it- </p><p>self for favorable action by him. </p><p> A bit of the Doctor’s irony recurred to him again</p><p>and again. </p><p> In commenting on the birth of the child, John-</p><p>ssen had said, “We ought to name it.” </p><p> And Doctor Santurn, head bowed in deep thought</p><p>for a few moments, had looked up and replied, </p><p> “We shall call it MacDuff. Like his namesake, he</p><p>was not born of woman!” </p><p>Playing With a Human Mind </p><p>A MILD, Indian summer’s evening in late Sep- </p><p>tember was declared favorable by Doctor </p><p>Santurn, for the final brain treatment that </p><p>should transform MacDuff’s mentality from medi- </p><p>ocrity to precocity.	|</p><p>Mason stood by, in sterile garb, and watched the </p><p>preparations that centered about the anterior fon- </p><p>tanelle of the infant’s cranium. </p><p> Trembling, hardly daring to speak for fear of be-</p><p>traying his emotion, he managed to subdue his ex- </p><p>citement, and asked to be allowed to participate in </p><p>the experiment. </p><p> “Ah, Gary! I’m delighted to see you running up</p><p>the ‘white flag’ at last, after all your opposition! I </p><p>knew you’d come around in time to the proper way </p><p>of thinking if I kept you here long enough. Stev- </p><p>ens ! Kindly set the controls for Friend Mason, and </p><p>we’ll have him close the circuit that will make of </p><p>this infant a genius.” </p><p> Grouped on either side of the swaddled infant,</p><p>intent on its proper placement by Johnssen, stood </p><p>the Doctor and his assistants. They instinctively </p><p>moved back a step, through force of habit, as Stev-&lt; </p><p>ens called, “Ready?” </p><p> “Quite ready!” croaked Mason, standing by thei</p><p>controls. He would have to work rapidly with the </p><p>thirty six seconds of exposure which the apparatus </p><p>was set to deliver. </p><p> “Go!” called the Doctor, intent on the prone in-</p><p>fant. </p><p> A metallic shriek pierced the quiet of the domed</p><p>room as Mason threw on the current, and drowned </p><p>the slight click of another device on the switch- </p><p>board, which he suddenly shifted without having </p><p>been bidden to touch it. </p><p> With desperate haste he pivoted the wave gen-</p><p>erator, raised its focus, and swept it slowly across </p><p>the heads of the unsuspecting group that stood ap- </p><p>parently intent on MacDuff. </p><p> His actions had been accomplished within fifteen</p><p>seconds, and then, with a sob, Mason broke the cir- </p><p>cuit with a hand switch, and let quiet fall again 13 </p><p>the laboratory. </p><p> Had he failed?</p><p> He did not know as he peered intently, fearfully)</p><p>at the immobile faces of the scientists. They stood </p><p>so quietly—almost like petrified men!</p><p> He shrank back in terror as the Doctor raised his|</p><p>head suddenly and pointed an accusing finger a^ </p><p>him. </p><p> “Gary”, said the Doctor bitingly, “you have</p><p>abused the most sacred canon of hospitality in </p><p>planning the destruction of your hosts. Don’t at- </p><p>tempt to deny it!” he barked, as Mason raised £ </p><p>trembling hand. </p><p> “If we had been in proper relation to the recep-</p><p>tor, we’d have been idiots by this time. The ray </p><p>you directed at us would have destroyed our brain </p><p>tissues. You’ve been carefully watched, you bigoted </p><p>would-be murderer, despite the fact that you ap- </p><p>peared to be free from observation!” </p><p> Mason, still white and shaken, was stung to re-</p><p>tort by the sharpness of the Doctor’s tone. </p><p> “Hospitality be hanged when Humanity’s happi-</p><p>ness is at stake! I’d do it again, if I had the </p><p>chance!” </p><p> “You would?” asked Doctor Santurn, his voice</p><p>silken with an ominous threat, </p><p> “Assuredly!”</p><p> “Then listen to this:” •</p><p> A few whistled notes issued forth incongruously</p><p>from the lips of the elderly scientist. </p><p> “Do you recognize the quaint little air, Gary? It’s</p><p>from Gilbert and Sullivan’s ‘Mikado’. To refresh </p><p>your memory, I’ll quote the words. ‘To make the </p><p>punishment fit the crime, the punishment fit the </p><p>crime!” </p><p> He paused for a moment to let his meaning im-</p><p>press itself on Mason’s mind, and then continued, </p><p> “In simple, unadulterated English, my good man,</p><p>you’ve asked for a taste of your own medicine!” He </p><p>nodded to his assistants. </p><p>Almost a Riot in the Laboratory </p><p>THERE was a wild threshing and straining and </p><p>heaving of bodies as Mason fought to evade </p><p>his captors. He reviled and cursed them and </p><p>spat in their faces as they secured him to the table </p><p>from which the infant MacDuff had been tenderly </p><p>removed. Finally, when he perceived the futility of </p><p>668 </p><p>AMAZING STORIES </p><p>struggling: further, he lay quietly, and just before </p><p>they focused the transmitter on his head he prayed </p><p>aloud, not for deliverance, but for the destruction </p><p>of his captors. </p><p> Stevens had replaced the disrupted tube with a</p><p>liew one, and the horrendous screech that now arose </p><p>as he closed the circuit seemed almost to have some- </p><p>thing human in its terrible protest. </p><p> Within a quarter of an hour from the time»he had</p><p>attempted the lives of the scientists, Gary Mason, </p><p>the one-time brilliant archaeologist had become met- </p><p>amorphosed into an adult with the mentality of a </p><p>three year old child—a sleepy child, at that. Doc- </p><p>tor Santurn called for Suki to put him to bed. </p><p> “Now, gentlemen,” he said to his dishevelled as-</p><p>sistants, “Science can proceed unhampered by fan- </p><p>atics. It is perhaps fortunate that our guest knew </p><p>nothing of the mines placed under our buildings, </p><p>nor of the bombs charged with Bridges’ gas which </p><p>is as deadly as Lewisite. Our knowledge is to be </p><p>devoted to one great purpose, and rather than let </p><p>our achievements fall into the hands of lily-livered </p><p>gentry who might convert it to their own maudlin </p><p>aims, I repeat our pledge to destroy, should it be- </p><p>come necessary, the Plateau and all it houses. Re- </p><p>member, I-1-” He paused, his face distorted </p><p>by a spasm of pain. </p><p> Swiftly he ripped his surgeon’s gown from his</p><p>body and bared his torso to the gaze of his startled </p><p>assistants. </p><p> “What do you see, Bridges?” he asked in a low</p><p>tone of alarm. “Quick!” </p><p> Bridges, pressing his own face as if in pain,</p><p>peered intently at the Doctor’s neck. </p><p> “There’s a peculiar enlargement under the angle</p><p>of the jaw,” he said. “Why! It’s swelling as I </p><p>watch I” </p><p> “QQickl Trace down the lymph nodes in the</p><p>neck,” the Doctor commanded, his face contorted. </p><p> Bridges did so. “Swelling too,” he announced,</p><p>“They’re like marbles. It’s almost like—I should </p><p>say like—” </p><p> “Go on, man!”</p><p> “Like metastasis in cancer, when the infection</p><p>spreads.” </p><p> “Good Lord!” blurted forth Stevens, inconsis-</p><p>tently calling on One he had long scorned. “We </p><p>never thought these currents would act like X-Rays! </p><p>Simple high frequency! Who’d have thought—!” </p><p>Dr. Santurn Acknowledges Defeat </p><p>tl TNAMN your ignorance!” said the Doctor </p><p>1 bitterly. “Ordinarily cancer takes up to a </p><p>couple of years to kill, and here you’ve </p><p>saddled me with an unknown hothouse variety that's </p><p>killing me in minutes! You gaping fools! Haven’t </p><p>you ever heard of the cumulative effect of Roentgen </p><p>Rays and Radium Rays? Well, now you know the </p><p>Neo Wave is similar. Oh, yes, now you’ll know! </p><p>Mark you my lads, I’m going fast, and I know it; </p><p>but you’ll follow soon yourselves! </p><p> ‘You, Johnssen! What’re you looking at on</p><p>your arm? What’s the trouble with your face, </p><p>Bridges? Nose seems badly off center. Hi, Stevens, </p><p>you blighted nincompoop! Do your feet hurt? </p><p>Poor Trilbys!” He laughed ironically. </p><p> With faltering steps he dragged his pain-wracked</p><p>body to the far corner of the room, and pressed </p><p>against the wall next a hexagonal panel set in- </p><p>visibly in the tiles. </p><p> Bridges was running about like one blinded,</p><p>futilely wringing his hands. </p><p> Johnssen gazed with terrible fixety at his fore-</p><p>arm, feeling the chain of nodes that were swelling, </p><p>up to the arm pit. </p><p> And Stevens was crying, frankly and unashamed-</p><p>ly as he clutched at his ankle. </p><p> “Boys,” said the Doctor in a sibilant whisper,</p><p>“We’re beaten! We have no remedy for this sort </p><p>of venom. It we’d have studied diseased tissues for </p><p>the sake of Humanity, as our friend Mason might </p><p>say, there’d be a fighting chance for us. Oh, well! </p><p>It was fun while it lasted; but something’s beaten </p><p>•us. </p><p> “Something? Is there a Something?”</p><p> The hexagonal panel was open, and deep into the</p><p>recess in the wall the Doctor inserted his arm. Sum- </p><p>moning his waning strength, he managed by a </p><p>tremendous effort to force a raucous croak through </p><p>his contracted larynx. </p><p> “AUotis! Mes enfants!" he called to the heedless</p><p>trio absorbed in their own separate purgatories. </p><p>“A short life, and a merry one!” </p><p> His arm, sunk to the shoulder in the wall recess,</p><p>turned slowly. </p><p>The lim-Keeper’s Last Words </p><p>THE proprietor of the Travelers’ Hotel in the </p><p>village, growing talkative, occasionally, to </p><p>some favored guest these days, may point to- </p><p>ward the Plateau, just as nightfall enshrouds it, </p><p>and describe it as a place beloved of the Devil. </p><p> “Nothing but ruins are standing there since the</p><p>night of the big explosion,” he explains. </p><p> “Two men who went up to investigate, dropped</p><p>in their tracks the moment they entered the gate, </p><p>and the rest of us at a distance held back a good </p><p>ways.

When</p><p>I had opened the window and drawn one refreshing </p><p>breath, I turned to him and found him pulseless. </p><p> It is a wonder that I did not go mad myself. I</p><p>had brought the car almost to rest, and now it slowly </p><p>settled until it lay motionless. I was at home at last </p><p>j—but what a home-coming! </p><p> Long I sat, discouraged and desperate, with bitter</p><p>thoughts, and Jack lying there before me. Finally </p><p>a soft breeze stealing into the open window roused </p><p>me. </p><p> The electric lights were glowing in the car, but</p><p>as 1 opened the door I found that it was night out- </p><p>side.

Tired out, </p><p>I lay down there and slept until the morning sun </p><p>awoke me. </p><p> It is needless to detail all that followed.</p><p> I found out that the car had come down in the</p><p>very heart of the Adirondack wilderness.

He had long believed that we were all dead.</p><p>But he agreed with me to keep the secret.
