                    <div type="column">
                        <ab>Hardened by the rigors of life on the plains, living for days in his saddle, his strength, courage and endurance put a
                            thou-sand times to the most severe tests, the Boss of the Range daily proves himself every inch a man--a man of blood and
                            iron. He has won his spurs by countless dar- ing feats, perfect calmness in the face of danger, tireless energy and
                            alertness, untold deeds of action, force and power. When you see him with his men on the range you know he's boss and what
                            he says goes. But the rugged, outdoor life of the ranchman which helps to keep his blood rich in strength-giving iron is
                            denied many a man whose indoor existence, hard work and worries sap his ener- gies and rob the iron from his blood. It is
                            for such men who need sustaining, health-building ? help of organic iron--Nuxated Iron--to in-crease the oxygen-carrying
                            power of their blood and thereby aid in restoring wasted tissue, strengthening their nerves and giving greater power and
                            endurance. Nuxated Iron is now used by over three million people an-nually as a tonic, strength and blood-builder.</ab>
                        <ab>"There are countless numbers of men today who at 40 are broken in health and steadily gping downward to physical and
                            mental decay simply because they are allowing worry, over-work, nervous strain, dissipation and occupa- tional poisons to
                            sap the iron from their blood and destroy its power to change food into living tissue, muscle and brain," says Dr. John J.
                            Van Horne, formerly Medical Inspector and Clinical Physician on the Board of Health of New York City. "Yet there are
                            thousands of such men who undergo a most remarkable transformation the moment they get plenty of the right kind of iron
                            into their blood to give increased energy and endurance. Their imagined ills are forgotten, they gain physical poise and
                            fitness, mental alertness and greater power to combat obstacles and withstand severe strains. To help build stronger,
                            healthier men</ab>

                        <ab>and women, better able physically, to meet the problems of everyday life, I believe that physi-cians should, at every
                            opportunity prescribe organic iron--Nuxated Iron--for in my ex- perience it is one of the best tonic and red blood builders
                            known to medical science."</ab>
                        <ab>If you are not strong or well you owe it to yourself to make the following test: See how long you can work or how far you
                            can walk without becoming tired. Next take two five-grain tablets of Nuxated Iron three times per day, after meals, for
                            two weeks. Then test your strength again and see for yourself how much you have gained. Many an athlete or prize fighter
                            has won the day simply because he knew the secret of great strength and endurance, which comes from having plenty of iron
                            in the blood, while many another has gone down to inglorious defeat simply for lack of iron.</ab>
                        <ab>Manufacturers' Note: Nuxated Iron, which is pre- scribed and recommended by physicians is not a secret remedy, but one
                            which is well known to druggists. Un-like the older inorganic iron products it is easily assimi-lated, does not injure the
                            teeth, make them black nor upset the stomach. The manufacturers guarantee success- ful and entirely satisfactory results
                            to every purchaser or they will refund your money. It is dispensed in this city by all good druggists.</ab>
