                <seg type="columnLine">I began to tire with the continued</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">Once the canoe swung and almost</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">drenching me. I realized that it was</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">impossible to continue head to wind,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and the only thing to do was to turn</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">However, I could not help that. I</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">suffering from alcoholism, his cousin, Doctor Forsyth, gave him a jolt of morphine. That settled young</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Lindon--he contracted the habit. Lindon, senior, a big steel manufacturer, learning of his son's
                    addiction,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">furnishes him with money to take a "cure." Back of Lindon, junior, stands his stanch and loyal friend,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Buck Whiting. Wishing to get a foothold in the steel business, and usurp the son's place, Doctor For-</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">syth devotes himself to the elder Lindon. After a hard fight against the fiendish drug, Lindon, junior,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">roturns home looking a physical wreck but clear-eyed. Catching him asleep, Forsyth commits the das-</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">tardly crime of hypodermically injecting into the young fellow's leg a dose of morphine. When he</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">wakes, Lindon, junior, feels ecstatic, and all the world is rosy again. False strength courses his frame.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">As in a dream, he rises, goes to the village and drinks whisky; under the double effect of booze and</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">drugs ho buys a morphinist's outfit and goes to New York. His father, hearing of his son's defection</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and shame, casts him off. Forsyth is given the position and power he craves. From bad to worse</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Lindon, junior, falls, until he sinks low enough to consort with the scum of the underworld. Out of</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">money and now a morphine fiend, he oven consents to peddle drugs illicitly for Jimmy the Cokie, who,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">in return, promises to furnish young Lindon with all the dope he wants.</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">gentleman. Between Captain Pope and Barrington there is strained feeling, and when the chief officer,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">on watch, calls the captain to verify Temple Rock light, Pope is furious at such foolish conduct. But</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">there is something puzzling about the light to Barrington, and he is insistent. Captain Pope arrogant-</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">ly orders him to steer according to tho signal. Soon the Columbian is piled up on a reef, and the crew</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and passengers take to the boats. Ashore the captain meets with ap engineer who is troubled about</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the wreck, fearing that his broken headlight, which had flared most peculiarly, might have put the ship</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">off her course. Pope experiences dread at learning this, but assures the engineer that his theery is</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">nonsense. At the official investigation the captain manages to throw all the blame upÂ»n the chief
                    officer,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and he is abetted by Ashley Corbin, who uses his influence to ruin Barrington. Stella had requested</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Ashley to stay out of it, and when she questions him as to what he has heard of the trial he dis-</seg>
