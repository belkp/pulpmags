            <seg type="columnLine"> So on the afternoon of the first day of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">June, 1950, Carol Dunfrey left New York</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">City in his Duplier plane. Two thousand</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">indicator for Washington he relaxed back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the pilot's seat.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Far beneath him the Jersey fields slipped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by and in a short time he could see wind-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing toward him, miles on his right, the glis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tening ribbon of the Delaware River. Though</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keenly alive usually to the beauties of na-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ture Carol today saw only houses and fields</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and water. The beauty was gone.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Stretching out toward the southern hori-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">zon was an unbroken line of planes, on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">New York-Washington course. Above him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the higher speed levels there would come</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a sudden ear-splitting hum rising to a high-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">er pitch and then receding as a plane shot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by at eight miles a minute. Below were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the free lanes of slower speed where local</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">planes could do as their pilots desired.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He was decidedly depressed this morn-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing. He had thought that he know what</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">depression was when both of his parents</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had left him so suddenly. It was true that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was alone except for Joan, and though</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was sure she could be depended upon,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still his uneasiness of soul was too great for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">love-making. Rising above the horizon of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his mental confusion there confronted him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the mystery of Henry Booth.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He felt instinctively that when he met this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man of mystery he would have to make a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> What help was it that Booth wanted?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Was it wealth? Was it power? He would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">refuse him if he called on the Dunfrey for-j</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tune to create more wealth. There was too</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">great a centralization of wealth as it was.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And still more he resented the wealth being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">used as a means to gain greater power.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Power was also too highly centralized. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought of the millions of workers, the city</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hordes of*men and women, hurried, restless,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">driven, aimless and unhappy.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He had thought once of giving most of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hio fortune away, retaining only enough to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keep him in comfort the rest of his life.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But what good would it do? The people</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who needed the money most would spend</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it foolishly, giving way to repressed cravings</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the next day would be back at work</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or in the bread line. They could not be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">helped by mere gifts of money.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> And they could not use power. That is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not wisely. He thought of the French Revo-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lution and what happened when the peasants</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took Russia away from the aristocrats. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought of the riots in London when the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Labor Party and the Liberals had been dead-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">locked over the nationalization of coal mines</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bill for two weeks. He thought of what</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">New York would be like if the workers</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">realized their power too suddenly.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">No! Emphatically no! He did not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">know what kind of help Henry Booth want-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ed but he would not help him place either</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">power or wealth in the hands of the ignor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ant, the avaricious or the ambitious.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">YET he felt that he ought to trust to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">good judgment of his parents. His</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">father had practically commanded him to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">help the man; and his mother, in one of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her most precious moments of confidence</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had also asked him to do what he could.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his plans were impractical and visionary?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Absolutely no. And that was the other way</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">course once it was set, he felt that it would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be worth while to do more of observation</seg>
