Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the clearly discernible anxiety that</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove him forward, he moved with prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed assurance along the winding game</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The squat native who served him gave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3</seg><seg type="columnLine">4	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scant attention to the track they followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even a white man could follow a spoor as</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain as the one they stalked. The black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, was as tense and wary as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master. His hard eyes endlessly combed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle walls about them. The least</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift in the forest's raucous noise pattern</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him up listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Plainly, the two men hunted, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not hunters in the usual sense. Like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, though their tense watchfulness re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed fear of discovery, it was not discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery by their quarry, but by other men that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they so anxiously sought to avoid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where the jungle trail sloped down to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream crossing, they stopped. The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hollow rose sweet with the scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unnumbered blossoms along the water's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge. Scarlet, yellow and purple flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed in a riot of color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men's eyes focused on a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the blossoms lay crushed and tram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled. They studied intently two huge im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints in the soft mud of the bank. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">footprints were of a size to bring gasps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement from any sportsman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the white man's only reaction was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter twist of his lips, a dart of anger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his black, unblinking eyes. He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusingly at the native and the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinched as though a lash touched him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes belied his suave, patrician look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayed the thing that linked him in close</seg><seg type="columnLine">brotherhood with the Congo. In the staring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething blackness of his eyes was revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blood kinship with this cruel, green</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, a oneness with the ruthless killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts who stalked the Congo trails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He cannot be far ahead," he snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When we come on him, this time keep your</seg><seg type="columnLine">head." His voice was harsh, threatening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, doktor," hastily answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native, his guttural pronunciation of "doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor" being uttered with a tinge of awe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear. The title was voiced like the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Branches snapped and rustled across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. A troop of baboons; coughing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">barking among themselves, swung along</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwind from the two men. They headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees, paralleling the trail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon moved from view. The ill-tempered</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree tribe was out of sight hardly a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">when their voices, harsh with anger rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in violent, stacatto barks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white man listened to the clamor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned inquiringly to the squat native,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some one comes," the black replied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unspoken question. The native knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from experience only sight of a man aroused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ugly-tempered baboons to such vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He must not see us," warned the doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The warrior nodded. His right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached almost too eagerly for the bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung across his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One quiet arrow," he promised, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will see nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," the white man decided, leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the native swiftly behind a concealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of shrubs. "We must not attract</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention. By killing him we might bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE two men squatted in hiding, sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing the urge to slap away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious gnats swarming in the foliage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They saw a small sturdy figure come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stream at a soundless trot. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pygmy, one of the strange, savage, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">people who drifted like ghosts through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, a people ruthless in war, feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and respected for their bravery and cun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muscles rippled smoothly in his arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders as the little man bent to drink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a regal grace in his movements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden power in his taut, hard body. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless manner in which he held his blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun showed he did not suspect the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of the hidden men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The pygmy crouched long by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, slowly drinking the cool water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Directly across from him, pressed deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft mud, were the two immense foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints. They were prints to excite any</seg><seg type="columnLine">native, especially an ever-curious pygmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The small man rose, however, trotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the water and passed the unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoor without so much as a glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the slight figure disappeared, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man stood up, slapping the stinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnats away from his face and hands. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black rose, too, expelled his breath with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is good we did not slay him," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told his master. "I recognize the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. He is N'Geeso, chief of the pygmies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His men would comb the forest to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">his killers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor made no reply. For just such</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason he had forbidden an arrow from</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ambush. He stared at the monster tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">squashed deep in the mud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Odd," he said, half to himself. "He ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">right by the tracks without noticing them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he shrugged his shoulders as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of no consequence and plunged for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, his long legs endeavoring to make up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hard-faced companion did not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss so easily the memory of the pygmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain's action, but he kept his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, knowing they would anger his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master. Experience had taught him an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense respect for the pygmies. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was second nature for the keen-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso to read every sign on the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fact that the little man gave no atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the giant tracks only proved he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already familiar with them and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of their origin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a secret in the hands of a pygmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer a secret. Yet the black man</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his tongue. Perhaps they could finish</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mission and get away before N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">could act. In any case, he dared not give</seg><seg type="columnLine">any additional bad news to the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly, they came to a fallen tree. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-dead trunk half blocked the trail, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its position and the freshly torn turf about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it told the story. Some creature of immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">power had lifted the rotting trunk from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the underbrush and tossed it into the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The soft damp wood on the underside</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scratched and ripped where huge fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers had searched for grubs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See! He begins to search for food," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor exclaimed. "His hunger will trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men pushed forward at a faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">gait. Their quarry was only a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. The white man's bow was tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, his unblinking eyes fierce and deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined. The native loosened the small pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried, shrugged it from his shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it ready in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jungle was abruptly silent. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strained, ominous quiet that falls when</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear grasps the forest's teaming small life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then ahead sounded the rending split of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood. A branch had been sheared from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, and the noise resounded like a blast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor broke into a run now. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">his untrained ears caught the crackle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampled shrubs, the snap of branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced aside by a ponderous slow moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Perspiration streamed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man's tense face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor and Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A green sweep of vines a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">further on shivered and ripped apart. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant figure burst through the wire-strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle, stood clearly revealed in the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was huge as a massive stone idol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hairy body was hideous in its size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rearing more than twice as tall as a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gross and monstrous breadth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped forward, balancing on awkward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over-size feet, his long arms dangling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Atop the mountain of flesh, the creature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulbous, misshapen head sat grotesquely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a formlessness about his fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, as though the face were wax that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had partially melted. The poorly mated</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes moved slowly, taking overly long to</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus on objects. Through some deformity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the neck muscles, the creature's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged always to the left and forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beast swayed dully in the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His sluggish mind struggled to decide on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his next move. In his posture, his hairi'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, his long arms, was a kinship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great apes. Yet no ape who shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Congo morning with a fearsome chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenge could stand in combat before this</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster for long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!

The quiver on his back was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with arrows, and in his right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried a powerful bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor moved through the jungle not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white hunter or even a native.

He gave his head a quick toss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing his blond mane into place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he stalked only a springbok, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the keenest enjoyment in matching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skill against the fleet, wily animal. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen ears caught no hint of the springbok's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearness, but his sensitive nostrils searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the creature's scent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor veered from the trail, slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">wraithlike through the seemingly impene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trable mesh of fern and vine.

The spring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bok's warm, fresh scent grew stronger as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he worked his way upwind toward his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lane opened between the trees.

The creature convulsed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE	7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its arcing flight, and writhing, disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the thick kunai grass. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief, surging rustle, then silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor trotted into the grass a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards and surveyed his kill.

Then he drew his knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with deft strokes, severed a few choice</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuts. He wrapped the meat in a broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool leaf, tied it with a vine so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried it slung beside his quiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mission completed, Ki - Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts turned immediately to his golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, Helene, waiting for his return at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silver River.

He seldom consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the drastic change in his existence, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his very being, that had taken place since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red-haired American girl had literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into his life. He rarely thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond that day when Helene's airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed engine trouble on a trans-conti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nental hop and made a forced landing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor started back along the trail, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon grew impatient at the slow pace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground travel. Securing his bow, he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a length of liana, and with a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust of his lithe body, swung to a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging bough. He ran along the branch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">catapulted upward to reach the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches, and began to move eastward to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the clearing and Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor drove in an almost straight line</seg><seg type="columnLine">for awhile, then adjusted his course to more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less parallel the main trail that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the river. His watchful eye soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught sight of a sturdy little figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely trotting in the same direction the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord followed. Ki-Gor studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jogging man intently a few moments, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognizing his small friend, N'G'eeso, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled with pleasure. He started to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the trail, overtake the pygmy chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a better idea struck him, broadened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord was unable to resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">a joke at N'Geeso's expense. Obviously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little chief headed for Ki-Gor's camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would startle and puzzle him if when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he arrived a third plate of food awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The pygmy would not rest until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned how Ki-Gor came to expect him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chuckling to himself, Ki-Gor began</seg><seg type="columnLine">framing outlandish tales of magical powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which to harass N'Geeso. The White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord swung in a wide arc around the trot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting native to escape discovery. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to race along the tree routes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzy speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWICE as he neared the camp, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a distinctive thrilling whistle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn Helene of his coming. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back like a soft musical echo as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate replied. The red-haired girl stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting in the clearing as Ki-Gor plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the trees, landed before her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a fitting mate to the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Jungle.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliced generous portions of meat, put them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cooking. The clearing was on the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Silver River, and Ki-Gor raced up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank to the first waterfall above the camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He darted along a narrow shelf of rock that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led behind the waterfall.

But if a white man had entered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">territory, he must have a look at him. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">renegade whites always came trouble. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man other than Ki-Gor was sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be within hundreds of miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this dense little-known Congo spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor rose, stood towering above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmy, a far-away look in his eyes.

N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotted behind the jungle couple, and .lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening to their carefree talk, his own elation</seg><seg type="columnLine">drained away, his face grew solemn. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pang of fear, of regret, darted through him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord's skill was the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle, and his bravery was unques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned.

He alone was responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble for leading Ki-Gor on this dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission and, suddenly, N'Geeso was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid for his great friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N'GEESO trailed the jungle couple in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence for a long while. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered by the sudden doubts which</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailed him. Time and again he started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call to the White Lord, urge him to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back.

In the jungle, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great hunter was respected above all. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could share in killing this monster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's name would be spoken with</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect in the furthest corner of the Congo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the chance of a lifetime, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man could not let it pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE watched the White Lord's easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride, heard his carefree voice. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's every move revealed the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and vitality that throbbed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscled body. The smooth play of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, hard muscles held N'Geeso's eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pygmy chief was suddenly reas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured. The White Lord of the Jungle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a man like other men. The gray-eyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel-nerved jungle man was a figure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">command respect and confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso smiled. He was an old woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">to doubt the powers of the mighty Ki-Gor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a fool to worry that his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not outwit the huge but stupid beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his bouyant spirits returned, he sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored the thought of Tembu George's arri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val. He planned how he would carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">refer to hunting down the monster, thereby</seg><seg type="columnLine">squelching completely the tales of prowess</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Masai leader intended to relate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though Ki-Gor lay little faith in</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's story of a strange monster, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took increasing note of the little man's cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty of action, N'Geeso took the lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they left the neighborhood of Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's camp. Without wasted motion, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmy hurried them along a network of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths toward the creature's haunts. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor expected at most to find some unu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sually vicious or hunger-maddened animal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's movements grew more stealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they progressed. He was cool as always</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a hunt, but Ki-Gor, from long expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rience, knew the pygmy was unusually</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then N'Geeso motioned them to a halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pursed his lips, gave a liquid, warbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird call. Helene took advantage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause to rest. Her pet monkey moved play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully through the branches overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was intrigued by N'Geeso's</seg><seg type="columnLine">action, but he asked no questions. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord lounged against a tree, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">interest apparently focused on the erratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of a small, bright-green frog. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the almost imperceptible rustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">which followed N'G'eeso's signal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly realized how carefully the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief had planned this foray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two bands of pygmies slid from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underbrush. They said nothing, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad grins adequately expressed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure at Ki-Gor's presence. N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced innocently at the White Lord. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior's presence showed how confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sly little chief had been that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lure the jungle man to the hunt. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled inwardly, yet he realized if N'Geeso,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such an able force of hunters, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him for aid, then the quarry must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dangerous indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He frowned, turned his gray eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene. As though reading his mind she</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed her head, emphatically declared: "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not do it, Ki-Gor; I am going with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I will not stay back here. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">there can't be any such monster. So don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worrying about me/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wah," Ki-Gor said in mock fear.

It was only a move to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the edge off Tembu George's visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The party moved forward again. Boko,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the pet he was, swung back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees above them. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying the outing as much as a city dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on a walk through the park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An increasingly strong gorilla scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailed Ki-Gor's nostrils. The harsh male</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent freshened as they went single file</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the trail. N'Geeso was in the lead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ki-Gor second, Helene next and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pygmy warriors strung out behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brilliant plumaged birds shrieked their</seg><seg type="columnLine">protests at Boko's antics,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He is just ahead," N'Geeso whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then we hunt one of the tree people?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Ki-Gor, employing the native name</seg><seg type="columnLine">for gorilla.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Aaaiiieee, Ki-Gor, my words are truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is a devil-beast such as you have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.

Emboldened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of his friends, the man-things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boko ranged with reckless abandon. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly after he disappeared, Boko shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">piercingly, his voice almost human in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror. He came hurtling back, threw him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into Helene's arms, shaking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene attempted to quiet Boko, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they followed N'Geeso in the direction from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the monkey had fled, the little fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low's terror increased. Finally, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand it no longer, and tearing himself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene's arms, he sped back down the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">K[-GOR was puzzled by the pet's action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing no ordinary jungle sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">could so frighten Boko. Urged by inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct, the White Lord tested his bow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it ready. Now the gorilla scent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere. He felt the short hairs along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of his neck bristle, felt his muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense. Yet his mind still found no explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for these instinctive reactions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trail opened into a sunlit clearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waist-high kunai grass rippled in the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind. Silence pressed over the clearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No sign of life stirred on the open land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a single bird call broke the eerie quiet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the staccato calls of the tree toads</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hushed. Yet, beneath this apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace was the electric feel of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though no word was spoken, the pyg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies paused at the edge of the clearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first time in his memory, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted apprehension among the bold little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters. This was the devil-beast's lair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somewhere in the still forest about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing lurked the monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the thing they waited for came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terrible, earth -shaking, the creature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattering challenge sounded. The faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze eddying over the kunai grass had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried their scent to him. The blasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise was an angry, rolling crash of thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no frightened quarry, fearful of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor stared across at the line of trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw a stand of saplings shiver, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sway back before an immense weight. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammoth creature smashed his way from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, stood clearly revealed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlit clearing.-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An involuntary scream broke from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene's lips. After a first gasp of alarm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pygmies froze in their tracks. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor stared at the gargantuan creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">in disbelief, unable to trust his own eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The monster stood upright, drummed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vast chest with mounting fury. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed many gorilla characteristics, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">in looks and actions.

A burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness possessed him. Studying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast, Ki-Gor's keen eyes discovered an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. Embedded deep in the monster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder were two arrows, the blood still</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebbed from the raw, torn flesh. No wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature raged at the sight of men; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew by bitter experience men were his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies and in his raging strength he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsted for vengeance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The monster screamed his hate to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens. He drummed his chest, ripped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore at the underbrush. Then, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landslide's fearful irresistible momentum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lunged to the attack. The earth shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the blasting drive of his feet. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible so huge and awkward a creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">could move so fast. A moan went up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pygmies, and except for N'Geeso, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were paralyzed. Ki-Gor watched the rac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing monster, knew in that moment poisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">darts could never halt that bulk of bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and muscle in time. There was just cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the pygmies' despair, for they also</seg><seg type="columnLine">had realized the truth too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord of the Jungle recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that instant the lives of all of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended on his actions.

Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood without a tremor as death raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. Steel-nerved, he swept an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow from his quiver, fitted it to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bow.

He raised one hand to claw at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face, tear at the arrow which lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">embedded in his eye socket.

The pygmies danced back and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forth eluding the giant's ever-more sluggish</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushes. Then, with almost stunning abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, the monster staggered and fell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly he was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A triumphant cry went up from the pyg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies.

"Truly it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a puzzle." He frowned, thinking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast's destructive power. "There is work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for N'Geeso, Tembu George and me. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must learn more about this mad one.

They wrangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly about the best method to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin, for they were laying plans even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now to parade this trophy through a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of villages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aamiieee," cried N'G'eeso, reaching high</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tap Ki-Gor on the chest. "Will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George's eyes pop when he sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. Never again will he dare raise his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice to boast of his puny hunts." N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">chortled in glee, "And those foolish Masai</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors will see what it means to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief who can lead his men to a real kill."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor nodded his head sagely, agreeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every word. Then he pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound in the creature's shoulder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathered tips of two arrows protruded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh. Even under their crust of dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood, the distinctive mark of the arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clearly discernible.

So much did the subject absorb</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, that he let drop his original aim to</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigate the white hunter's presence. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to return to Silver River and</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately upon Tembu George's arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out with the Masai chieftain to back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">track the devil-beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back at their camp the next day, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle couple directed preparations for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George's visit. The pygmy hunters</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped lay in a stock of game and fruits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alone of all the pygmies, N'Geeso was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">little help. Yet he was most anxious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all for Tembu George to arrive. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmy chief squatted by the fire, rocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">happily on his heels, embroidered over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to himself an ever more detailed tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the devil-beast with which to amaze the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nightfall came without any sign of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai. In the morning, feeling certain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big fighting men must arrive soon, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was astir at dawn. As the hours passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneventfully, the camp grew more watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was mid-morning when Ki - Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly straightened, stood listening. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes focused on his intent face, "One man</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes," the White Lord said at length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tembu George runs ahead," suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is so," N'Geeso quickly agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ki-Gor said nothing.

It was not like Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">to outdistance his men and Ki-Gor knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. Then minutes later, a tall, muscled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai warrior raced into view. His body</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistened with sweat. His breath came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy, uneven gasps of a man who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtaxed his strength. But though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai was obviously exhausted, he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself proudly, stiffly erect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warrior paid no attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of welcome which greeted him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed through the line of pygmies that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved to meet him, went straight to Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor.

"Speak, Bagodu!" the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord said swiftly. "What is it?"

The pygmies fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked silence.

Helplessly the warrior concluded:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is dying and we can do nothing. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin is like fire and his muscles hardened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into steel knots."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso had pushed his way to Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.

Many Wasuli had died with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the last few moons. Even friendly, peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loving old King N'hya-Nyag was struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with the Fever. The new king,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalido, was the former ruler's cousin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go at once!" Ki-Gor told Bagodu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He must not die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor glanced at Helene. Knowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain in his heart, she said nothing. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he trotted from the clearing, she ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side. Tembu George was also her</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. And unnoticed in the confusion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boko, Helene's pet scampered to follow his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We follow," cried N'Geeso, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle couple swung into the tree routes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped toward the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's mind was in turmoil. A world</seg><seg type="columnLine">as bright an hour before, was suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened. Tembu George's loss would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave a void in Ki-Gor's life. In addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the mighty Masai chieftain was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence for good in the jungle second</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to Ki-Gor. With his steadying influ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence gone, a score of old feuds might well</seg><seg type="columnLine">revive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The war-like Masai, once the scourge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Congo, now worked with Ki-Gor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintain peace, avoid senseless bloodshed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With Tembu George dead, a weaker, less</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant leader might be unable to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">in check Africa's most dreaded warriors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the method in which Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">was injured puzzled Ki-Gor. It was unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skilled warrior to be taken unawares</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by man or beast. While such thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned endlessly in his mind, the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord and his mate sped through the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight of the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither the great-muscled White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor his slim, lithe mate spoke as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove tirelessly toward the Wasuli vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. There was none of the usual joy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their graceful, swinging flight. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of playful jibes, the leisurely side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explorations, were forgotten. This was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly serious race with death.

It was odd that the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegraph lay unused. Ordinarily, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great drum would be spelling out Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George's progress, and the' message would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be picked up by distant villages to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">relayed in an ever-widening circle through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Congo. The Masai chieftain's fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a matter of deep interest to countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes, whether friendly or enemy peoples.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then when the Wasuli were so close he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could smell the smoke of their campfires,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great drum spoke. It spoke with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, swift breaks that an accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">drummer sending a vital message imparts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavy and ominous the drum beat sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor slowed and stopped as the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum's notes smote the air. He listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his face was graven stone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened and his broad shoulders sagged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long steel-fingered hands knotted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene could not read the drum talk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this once she did not need to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the rapid beat.

The tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight American Negro who had won</seg><seg type="columnLine">leadership of the Masai through his wis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom and strength of arms never again</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cry out a happy greeting to Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Helene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">16	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minutes passed before Ki-Gor stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Then with careful, deliberate move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, he descended to the ground. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene joined him, he led her toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. Boko, upset by the strange actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his masters, followed disconsolately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The death drum still maintained its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmic beat when they entered the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. Ki-Gor halted at the entrance, stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the unfamiliar cluster of huts. He sel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom visited the Wasuli. Their record was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one to inspire the White Lord's trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">or friendship.

KiGor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not acquainted with Kalido, the new ruler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had assumed the throne two moons</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men and women stood about in small</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups. There was an air of uneasiness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village. In each person's mind was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that perhaps he might be the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim. Then, too, it was not good that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Masai chieftain should die in their vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In some unaccountable way, the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai might attach Tembu George's death</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. The Wasuli, warriors and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike, wished above all else not to antag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onize the Masai fighting men. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed this tension, knew its origin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, a keen-eyed woman saw Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor and his red-haired mate.

He raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand as he approached the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple. His bright, quick eyes never</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered from the White Lord's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I greet you in sorrow, Oh Ki-Gor," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big man said in deep, even tones.

Not only would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an affront to the Wasuli to refuse, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no other nearby place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">adequate honor could be given.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor understood the cause of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry.

Pie transformed the village into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beehive of activity. The women hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set great fires, prepare the traditional</seg><seg type="columnLine">burial feast. The warriors oiled their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, daubed themselves with the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and white designs of mourning. The chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">witchdoctor and his assistants, in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearsome masks, stood vigil around Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, shrilling incantations. With their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattling gourds and chanting, they formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a protecting barrier to ward off the evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits which the natives believe gather</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the newly dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the dark, sullen river which flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the Wasuli village was the scene of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest activity. The River Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sound, the natives called it. Its dark, oily</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters flowed with infinite slowness past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village to disappear into the black, dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swamp of Mists. From time immemorial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">2--Jungle Stories--Spring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wasuli had floated their dead down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, the mourners halting their canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the swamp mists reached out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive the burial canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wasuli spoke of the swamp in hushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices. No native ever set foot there. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an unknown, mysterious place given</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the spirits of the departed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives believed no man could enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling mists and emerge alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, on the river bank, the Wasuli</seg><seg type="columnLine">busied themselves decorating their war</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes with wreaths of blue and white flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. Special pains were taken with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe which would carry Tembu George's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A couch of fragrant grasses was laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the canoe, covered with lion skins. Fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and water were placed by the bier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gifts were put in the boat's prow and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of weapons laid near the couch. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">practiced hands, the Wasuli rigged floats</seg><seg type="columnLine">on either side of the boat, cleverly fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to balance the canoe and hold it steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its course. From each float a line was</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended back to a following canoe, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving added control over the burial boat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN, when all was in readiness, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death drum spoke. In two long files,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chanting Wasuli approached the hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'here Tembu George lay. The tall, stern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced Masai walked in the fore of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession, followed by Helene and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord. Before the hut they halted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With solemn ceremony, Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lifted on the joined shields of four</seg><seg type="columnLine">specially selected warriors. Raising the</seg><seg type="columnLine">departed chieftain's body high, they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly down the lane formed by the Wasuli.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great drum's rolling beat spoke out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the forest, and on distant trails, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-off villages men paused, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty leader went on his last march.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the village went the procession,</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the open gate, and down the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the river. The long singing files grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">now as the women and children fell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the warriors. Their lamenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices took on a strange, unreal quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they entered the jungle. The giant trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tangled creepers and thrusting walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bramble caught the Wasuli dirge, muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, threw back no echo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all a bad dream to Ki-Gor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">18	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fatalist though he was, even at this mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, Ki-Gor could not grasp the fact of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George's death. He had seen many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men die, had been near death himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless times, but he was unprepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this. Time and again his mind told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him: "It cannot be." But when his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on the upraised shields, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grim truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took his place with Helene in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lead canoes. Kalido sat at a special</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the prow.

The other boats cast off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in utter silence, for the chanting had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, the double row of watercraft began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The funeral canoe hardly required use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guide lines attached to its steadying</seg><seg type="columnLine">floats. As though drawn by a magnet, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid gently downstream, headed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swamp of the Mists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except for the purl of water against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boats, the breathing of the paddlers</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they kept the loaded canoes together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quiet continued unbroken for long</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. Then a Wasuli in each canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted a hand drum to his lap, smote it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp, quick cadence, and far back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord heard the witchdoctor lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice in a high, wavering sing-song.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though the river appeared as sluggish</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ever, the canoes now moved more swiftly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly nosed through the dark water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor gave an involuntary shiver. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was abruptly damp, heavy with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of stagnant pools, rotting vegetation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the banks the bright green foliage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was replaced by ragged, yellow-mottled</seg><seg type="columnLine">underbrush and the huge trees took on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead look, their bark blackened, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs thick with curtains of moss. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no life, no movement anywhere as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mourning party swept close to the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was shaken from his oppressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts by Helene's voice beside him:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look, Ki-Gor, the mists!" And ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them he saw white folds of vapor shimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twist and curl over the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the boat surge under him, gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed as it swept toward the swamp. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to cry out for the procession to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stop. He wanted to shout that this evil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unclean haunt was no proper resting place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a Masai chieftain, for his friend. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thought struck him, Kalido leaned for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, knife in hand, and with one quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">slash cut the guide rope which bound them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-Tembu George. In the other lead boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another native simultaneously severed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other rope. Then paddles bit deep, brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two lines of following craft almost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a standstill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The funeral canoe drove toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists alone. Sunlight shone on the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers, gleamed on the weapons, illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated the massive black man who lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe. Then the sunlight was gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the first fingers of mist curled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat's prow. The white folds fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicker and suddenly the craft was blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR sat staring at the water dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the entire trip back to the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. His every instinct urged him to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as soon as possible, lose himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grief in the jungle. He had no stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ceremonies still to come. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature of the wild, he wanted the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionship at this time of no one but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate. Yet he knew he must not leave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Native custom demanded that he stay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village until morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene understood the bronzed giant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood. She knew the emotions that surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this jungle-reared man, the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste he felt for the feasting and dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were part of the rites to be endured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as they took their place in the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound, the couple's composed demeanor</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayed no inkling of their thoughts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wasuli.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fires leaped up as the swift dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. The distant rumble of a lion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned out by the abrupt start of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums. A muscled warrior armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear and shield, his body daubed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">white markings, moved lithely toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of drummers. He sprang high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandishing the spear, and then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard's grace began the symbolic Dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord at first watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling, posturing figure indifferently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his gray eyes sharpened with inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est as he recognized the dancer. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalido, King of the Wasuli, rendering this</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE	19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">final honor himself to Tembu George. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big man made an impressive figure in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting firelight as he moved skillfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the barbaric ritual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By dancing, he pays a very great tribute</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Masai, doesn't he, Ki-Gor?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord nodded in answer, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze following Kalido's gyrations. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">length he said softly, "He is a strange--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unusual man." And in Ki-Gor's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was neither approval nor disapproval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene glanced questioningly at Ki-Gor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She lacked her mate's keen insight into</seg><seg type="columnLine">native character, a knowledge gained only</seg><seg type="columnLine">through years of contact with the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is a strong man, the first strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader the Wasuli have had in many years,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor told her. "He can do a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of good--or make the Wasuli worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have ever been."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, he has made a good beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">today," said Helene. "I know the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have had with this tribe. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalido can lead them straight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is my hope," declared the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two women shyly approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle couple now, placed gourds filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with food before them. It was a rich feast</seg><seg type="columnLine">with many kinds of meat and fish, a variety</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fruits and vegetables, and quantities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of native beer. The women brought gourds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cool spring water instead of the harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">brew to Ki-Gor and Helene, still another</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of how carefully Kalido catered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the likes of his guests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord and his mate both pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to partake of the food, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">play acting for they were entirely with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out hunger. After the long, strenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, however, Helene was thirsty. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought first of Ki-Gor and reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his drink, urged him to take a few swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows at least. He shook his head as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">proffered the gourd, so with a worried sigh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene tipped up the container, drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feasting and dancing continued late</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the night. The jungle couple were</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined from time to time by the Masai or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalido, and it was a long while before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to seek the quiet of the hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">assigned them. Even then, despite their</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter weariness, sleep did not come easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Counter to her usual habit, Helene was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake the next morning long before Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor. The earth was gray with the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and the village was damp and cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the mists which had rolled in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river during the night. Helene shiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in the unaccustomed dampness when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she first awakened, but soon she felt hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feverish. Then the chill returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lay quiet until Ki-Gor awakened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not wishing to worry him and delay their</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure, she said nothing, though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt ever more miserable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to go home, Ki-Gor," she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Let's not stay here even for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning meal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor ran his hand through her soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, caressed her gently. "I want to go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too," he said. "But N'Geeso should arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">by evening. He will feel badly at having</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed the ceremony. Perhaps we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene bit her lip. There were fine beads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perspiration on her forehead, around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mouth. She smiled at her mate, said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her most winning voice, "Please. Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">go now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He quickly gave in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us go pay our respects to Kalido</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we will leave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor did not notice that Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for him to walk ahead, that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately lagged behind.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground seemed to roll beneath her feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village weaved and shifted before her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. She got through the farewells to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai warriors all right, but her face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and set as they approached Kalido.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Wasuli king apparently had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake for some time. He had eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily according to the empty vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him.

But Kalido's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp eyes flicked over her taut features</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he frowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were almost to the gate when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene stumbled again, and this- time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite Ki-Gor's aid, she sagged to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. The White Lord looked at her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing alarm. Her eyes were closed, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">color drained from her face, and her body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rigid against his arm. He lifted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, held her tightly, his gray eyes con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused and alarmed. Automatically, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and strode through the village to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hut they had left earlier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor placed his slim mate on the sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mat, knelt beside her.

Now it was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene, taking her as he watched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his jungle knowledge, with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill, strength and courage, he was help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to save her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALIDO watched the White Lord's</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething torment as he learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene was dying, waited while the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant bent frantically over the scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing girl.

It was clear to him that after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few more breaths Helene would be gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalido was apprensive about how Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would react.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-G'or's devotion to his wife was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle legend. At the least threat of harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Helene, he had been known to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a calm, even-tempered man into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging, relentless battler. In losing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, might not the primitive giant in insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief connect the Wasuli with his tragedy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in all his terrible strength and madness</seg><seg type="columnLine">on those about him? Kalido thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this and was fearful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Kalido's fears were in vain. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it happened, when the White Lord real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized Helene was gone, he did nothing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not move or speak. It was as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment his body had changed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wasuli leader stared at the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered white man crouched there by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his still mate. He was stunned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible mute sorrow apparent in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of that powerful body. This was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reaction he had expected.

Then as the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning deepened, Kalido parted the matting</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the door, called softly to the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord.

A long</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he stood thinking before he went in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor. He spoke then as an old friend, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">harsh voice soft with emotion, speaking as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">father to a son who has been injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But O'gaahni's words were as nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The giant dimly outlined in the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither saw nor heard the Masai.

His face was a tight, hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask as he curbed his emotions, squatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside O'gaahni to hear the tragic story</seg><seg type="columnLine">in detail. When he heard Ki-Gor's reac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he shook his head. Better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone else, he understood the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will do no good to try again to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," N'Geeso said.

The pygmy was a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hut, his low voice barely audible</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the walls. But as Ki-Gor's oldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most trusted friend he succeeded where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others had failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor followed N'Geeso from the hut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The White Lord's face was gaunt with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue and sorrow. There was a queer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank look in his eyes. He stared straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, evidencing no recognition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone. Though death is commonplace in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle, Ki-Gor somehow had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered the possibility of Helene's death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shock of its coming so soon after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George's loss struck him with fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful impact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his stunned state, the white giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood silently by N'Geeso, allowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasuli to begin the ceremonies without</seg><seg type="columnLine">voicing a word. The whole thing seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dream to Ki-Gor. It was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreal, a dimly grasped event without</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning or significance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor walked beside his friend as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession wound through the village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the path in the forest to the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. He moved like an automaton, awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly taking his place in one of the lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes. He stared unseeingly at the dec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orated boat which held his mate. N'Geeso,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his small shoulders bowed under the rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">events of the past few days, sat quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment, a suppressed murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran along the bank. Men made quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbing motions, tried to corner an agile</seg><seg type="columnLine">little form that darted determinedly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene's boat. Boko, the red-haired girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pet monkey, had followed the procession</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees and now was racing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the still form of his mistress. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of men barred him from the boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the quick-witted monkey did an about-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, sped to Ki-Gor's boat. With a leap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached Ki-Gor's shoulder, grimaced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pursuers, and was away again racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a tight-rope walker over the guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">line which led to Helene's canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor blinked his eyes, and watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">22	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the monkey, he frowned. He turned like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man roused from deep sleep to look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso. His frown deepened, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to stand up. But as the pygmy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand touched his arm, the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's her pet," N'Geeso told the Wasuli.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Leave him alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the second time in three days, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats slid through the heavy, black water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The frown remained on Ki-G'or's face. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance did not once leave the canoe which</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided smoothly, gracefully in the lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then as the river banks grew blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dead, the white mist began to shimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curl in the distance. The canoes moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster, drove toward the beckoning mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor tensed as the gleaming knives</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashed the guide lines. The canoes slowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but the one flower-covered craft which</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped straight into the whiteness and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. No sound broke the oppressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence until at Kalido's signal, paddles</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the water with soft splashes, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoes, sent them gliding upstream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blackened, moss-hung trees fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. The yellow, mottled, struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines and underbrush gave way to healthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">green foliage. Now for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's glance lifted, turned from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river to the tree-lined banks. He watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the branches press close overhead as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe swept along the shore. Then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smooth, quick movement which took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire party by surprise, the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, grasped a low-hanging branch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung out of the boat. He was gone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly a sound, melting into the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso stared after his friend, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled, but he did not try to call him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. He understood. Ki-Gor was react-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his trouble not like a native, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">an animal of the jungle. Unlike the aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age man, he wanted not sympathy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionship, but only solitude in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to heal his wounds alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN he first left the canoe, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself through the trees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzy speed, trying, through physical exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, to numb himself to the growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">anguish he felt. He drove himself unmerci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, until at last he flung himself weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">and panting beside a small stream. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank the cool water greedily, realizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time in many hours how great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was his thirst. After a brief rest, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to travel on foot, moving toward no</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular destination, merely keeping him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self on the go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When night fell, Ki-Gor sought the shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of a tree, lay wide-eyed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hours. He hardly heard the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">pad of night prowlers, the cough of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion, the myriad familiar noises that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded the jungle blackness. Gnawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger drove him to eat in the morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but too listless to hunt, he only munched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few pieces of fruit near at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day and the next he drifted aim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly through the forest. He kept ever to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, avoiding the occasional bands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives threading the trails. He was trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed into a surly jungle creature fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing secret, little-traveled ways, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cat-like stealth through shadowred</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastnesses. Though he sought no goal, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways he kept in motion, urged on by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner restlessness he could not deny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Red-eyed and disheveled, Ki-Gor came</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last to a place that made him pause. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed the dank air, his nostrils tightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the heavy odor of rot and stagnant water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fie looked down to find he stood deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud. His face puzzled, he noted his sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings - closely for the first time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. Great moss-hung trees, their black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened trunks mottled with fungus, lay all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all at once he knew where he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite his effort to flee into the solitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle, to escape the memory of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, his subconscious mind had guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back to the Swamp of Mists. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down a bleak lane of trees and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance saw the restless white curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mist which marked the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp. He felt desperately alone in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">desolate, rotting waste, and realizing how</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly lacking in life the entire area was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an odd, nameless fear laid hold of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But still he stood in the unclean wetness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the mist's shimmering movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling the painful silence thrust at his ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums with mounting violence. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wanting to leave, but somehow power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to go. He watched the swaying white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness until his eyes ached with strain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, suddenly, he started. A dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">form moved in the bare limbs of a tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him! Or wras it his imagination ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His muscles tensed until they were tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE	23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with pain. He searched the leafless branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to locate the thing that crept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wet bark. What kind of creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">would seek this barren waste? Fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stories born of native superstition</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed through his mind. He gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntary shudder. Did this furtive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy being come from the Swamp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mists ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw it again. The creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted into view, was gone, and then mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ever nearer, it came in sight once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Ki-Gor stared hard, and smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly at himself, he relaxed. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey, a very muddy, very bedraggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the spell which had bound him now</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, Ki-Gor turned on his heel, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pick his way toward dry ground. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted no more of this ugly bog. Yet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he took five steps, he stopped in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks. His mind was functioning normally</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time in days, picking up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threads so abruptly snapped off in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible hours in the Wasuli village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That monkey! The thought of it held</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He pressed his hand against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead, searched his mind for an answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay hidden there, and abruptly memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged over him. The monkey was Boko,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course! Yet how could Boko be here</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he swept into the mists in Helene's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eattoc?--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor wheeled around, and his deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice shattered the quiet as he called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monkey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boko did not wait for the familiar voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call him twice. With shrill, relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries, he raced along the branches, leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Ki-Gor's arms. He hugged the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord about the neck, chattering explosively</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this display of affection, Boko</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an unexpected, bewildering move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tore himself loose from Ki-Gor's arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped back into the tree, raced a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps toward the mist. Then he stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back at the White Lord, muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Boko, let's get out of this place,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the monkey only grew more upset,</seg><seg type="columnLine">darting back to Ki-Gor, then starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the swamp. Puzzled, the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">man watched the pet's antics a full minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">before their significance dawned on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The White Lord pursued his lips in a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boko meant to lead him into the Swamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mists!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR could not fathom the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal's purpose. Perhaps in leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the canoe after it passed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists, Boko had discovered something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a treasure in his eyes. Certainly, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of supreme importance to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">small m'ind would cause him to raise such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a disturbance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swamp was distasteful to Ki-Gor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in reverting to normal, his dread of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place was gone. He considered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, then shrugging his shoulders in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrender, he gave in to the pet. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, what difference did it make where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went? If it would please Helene's be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved Boko, then he would indulge the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sure-footed jungle man picked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way cautiously over the dangerous ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwilling to risk attempting to follow Boko</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the rotting trees. The branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hold the monkey's slight weight, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting Ki-Gor's muscled bulk was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other matter. It was slow, difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress, but the White Lord, growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily more intrigued with Boko's strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">antics, worked his way to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated at this shifting barrier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing that in passing it he was breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a native taboo. Then, with a deep breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he plunged ahead, following the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boko's voice. The fog thickened with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">every step and Ki-Gor began to wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much further he could continue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to doubt the wisdom of humoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monkey's whim. Feeling his way along</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly, Ki-Gor's feet struck solid ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer sank in sticky mud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly, the mist thinned. A few steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">further and the White Lord was free of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clinging fog. He walked faster now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting that the ground continued to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmer. The blackened moss-choked trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way to living timber. Boko romped</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead through the branches, turning from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time to make sure Ki-Gor still</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor abandoned the slow, tiresome</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot travel, swung into the trees and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward at a faster pace. After a time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">24	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the bank of a river, and studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">its dark waters, he knew it was the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">river that flowed past the Wasuli village.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Following the bank, he watched the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">broaden, grow more sluggish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was unprepared for the next scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">that greeted him. A great lake opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, a vast expanse of water into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the River of Silence emptied. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow-shot from where he stood was a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, its trees and foliage brightly green</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sunlight. He studied the rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach and his eyes narrowed with interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canoe after canoe was drawn up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wondered at this secret of the Swamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mists for so many canoes were clear evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence that many natives lived on the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then after the first surprise of his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery was past, he noted the craft more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. More than half of the canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were decaying and broken. Half frown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he glanced up and down the beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which he stood, and was startled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find countless more of the native boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">extending as far as the eye could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now he understood. He had mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily forgotten the purpose of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. It was the graveyard of the Wasuli.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These rotting canoes were eerie tomb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones revealing the numberless natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had floated down the silent river to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their final rest. He glanced at the muddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake waters, struck with the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many craft must rest in the murky</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found his eyes searching suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a canoe still bright with decorations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he recoiled, realizing what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, not wanting in his heart to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">this particular one. He called softly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boko, meaning to leave the lake, turn back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the land of living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But against his will, he glanced once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more at the island. He tensed and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one knee behind a concealing bush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the water, two men strolled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view on the canoe-littered beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One man was white, an immaculately</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed, distinguished looking fellow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other wTas a squat, thick-bodied black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor watched the odd pair stroll out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight down the beach. Then the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord squatted in hiding a long time, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the appearance of other men. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no other sign of life. He debated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly with himself, then decided he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never rest if he left without learning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for the white man's presence in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swamp of Mists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR rose and moved swiftly along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank, his keen eyes flicking over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoes lined along the way. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasuli make their craft well, so it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before he found one that would safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry him. He noted the paddles remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the boat, but all weapons, gifts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trinkets had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord was armed only with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knife, but he anticipated no trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all, the advantage of surprise would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be his. Boko huddled in the bow as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man sent the canoe skimming as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as he dared, considering the degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its seaworthiness. His skillful paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit the water without sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With one final thrust, he sent the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">skidding through the shallow water to beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly in the soft mud. He picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boko, waded to dry ground and, releasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monkey, set out to follow the pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen from the mainland. He ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the swift, gliding step of a person</seg><seg type="columnLine">born to the jungle trails, his keen eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping him easily on the track. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no special plan in mind, meaning only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to confront the two, ask them bluntly how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came to be in the Swamp and - what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did there. This fdrbidden land was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange place for a well-dressed white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and stranger still for a native.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor heard the low sound of voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversing in the Wasuli tongue. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was that of the white man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening, the White Lord marveled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ease and fluency with which the fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low handled the awkward language. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had turned and were now walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">back toward him. The White Lord put</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boko down, and stopping, waited in plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">view for the odd pair. They came along</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, strolling unhurriedly, the native pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing close attention- to his master's words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black was the first to sense Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence. He looked up startled, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">widening when he saw the tanned giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless in the path. He recoiled, jab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering a warning to his companion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man looked up now, but except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint arching of his eyebrows, he betrayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no emotion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE	25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! I come without wreapons," Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor declared, announcing his peaceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions through the traditional native</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smile formed slowly, almost delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately, on the white man's face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked forward, extending his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You gave us a start here, friend," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

He was aware,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though apparently his full attention was</seg><seg type="columnLine">focused on the white man, that the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him with hostile eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry," Ki-Gor said. "I saw you</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking along the beach and wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you did on this island. This land is</seg><seg type="columnLine">taboo, you know. It might go hard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you if the Wasuli learned you entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land of their dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Ki - Gor's words, the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely piercing gaze grew more intense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Wasuli will not learn I'm here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said crisply, "unless you tell them. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust that will not happen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki - Gor sensed a threat in the quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not seek trouble, but if this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair wanted it, it was a matter of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference to him. He shifted his weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly, stood perfectly balanced to counter</seg><seg type="columnLine">any hostile move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I asked why you were here," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and I expect an answer." This time his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice rang coldly. "White men do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trample the beliefs and laws of the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this territory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white man sensed the abrupt shift in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's attitude. His glance flicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the jungle man's superbly muscled</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Then he smiled, spread his arms in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sweeping gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't misunderstand me," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm glad to tell you--rather show you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I am here.

The man was so open</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his work, so anxious to explain it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord felt perhaps he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">too abrupt. After all, he considered, he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, was an intruder in the Swamp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Ki-Gor," the White Lord said</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply as they began to walk along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path.

He stopped, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for Boko. The monkey had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, which was strange, for ordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took a keen delight in inspecting new</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. After repeated calls, Boko came</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctantly from his hiding place behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bush. He made a wide circle around Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere and the native, darted nervously</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Malu's hard eyes studied the bedraggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">little monkey as intently as though it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first one of its kind he had ever seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the black's gaze, the pet began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tremble and leaped into the security</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ki-Gor's arms. The White Lord was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled by this behavior, because neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere nor the native had seen the monkey</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, so there was no discernible reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the creature to be afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you ar Ki-Gor," declared Devere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignoring Boko's presence. "No wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">you came to investigate us. I've heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your trouble with renegade whites wTho</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift in here to victimize the natives. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm truly sorry to hear about your wife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even in this remote place, I have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales of her beauty and goodness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was the Fever of the Black Water,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained Ki-Gor painfully. "You are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. Why don't you try to find a cure</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this Fever. It seems to infect only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wasuli region."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor turned his piercing eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">26	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, hesitated before he spoke. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time, the White Lord noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact of those black, unblinking eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a physical blow. Devere's tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was low-pitched as though he confided a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can cure the Fever!" He leaned close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the White Lord. "Don't you see, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fever is one of the main reasons I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. It is the basis of my studies. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning to control it, I have opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to even greater findings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a real fervor in Devere's voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost an awe at the miracles he foresaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of his successful research.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will see what I am doing, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarantee you will be surprised," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued. "In fact, you may be able to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. For a long time, I've needed someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you. There are some natives helping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they aren't much good in this kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you can keep others from dying of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fever, I will help any way I can,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, fine!" Devere said'enthusiastically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If what I plan succeeds, not one single</seg><seg type="columnLine">person will ever have the Fever again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They walked on in silence, both sunk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own thoughts about the Wasuli</seg><seg type="columnLine">malady, until the doctor glanced up, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared, "Well, here we are at my quarters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was not prepared for the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">that greeted him. He had expected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">modest camp with one or two thatched huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a handful of native workers. Instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a series of large, well-built log</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings and many natives moved about</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tasks. The entire place was unusu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally neat and clean. As the}" approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the buildings, Ki-Gor saw how care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully and solidly it was constructed. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive walls would task the strength of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bull elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another unusual thing attracted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord's notice. Not a single native</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped work to stare at the stranger. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, the speed with which the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored was increased by the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Devere and the White Lord. Ordinarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least distraction was welcomed by na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives as a reason for shelving their duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor led the way into the building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a series of comfortably furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms where he apparently lived, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a large, clean, white room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my laboratory," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Ki-Gor's untutored eyes it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a room filled with an unusual jum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble of bottles, glass tubes, and odd-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">contraptions. He had no way of knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was an exceptionally well equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, I first learned of this Fever</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Black Water, as the natives call it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was practicing in America.

"You mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fought you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere threw back his head and laughed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unpleasant, humorless laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said.

But my little world</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not understand," he sneered. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">said I was cruel, unbalanced and a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other foolish things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's strange manner began to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor uneasy.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the monkey Ki-Gor held. "Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">that creature, for instance. With a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months of treatment, I can alter its looks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, and personality completely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paced the floor, his hands clasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, his thoughts ranging far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the confines of the room.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks showered up and a sheet of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">seared through her body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly the agony was gone. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath came easily. She opened her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, and though the room wavered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow-hued mist, she could see. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, even the difficulty with her eyes was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and she looked about her wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red-haired girl lay in a large, high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceilinged room. Helene tried to move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found she was securely bound to a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Turning her head, she saw cabinets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of equipment, test-tubes, X-ray machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining medical instruments. She was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered by this strange room, at a loss to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand how or why she was there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her mind was a blank as to her past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could think and reason, but she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remember. Her bonds pressed tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">against her arms and legs, and trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move to ease the numbness, she caused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden table to creak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of sight behind her, a chair scraped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor as someone stood up. Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard slow, measured footsteps approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Without a word, the man came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside her, studied her face closely. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a lean, distinguished-looking man, gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the temples with black, burning eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took her pulse carefully, then leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to pull back one of her eyelids,</seg><seg type="columnLine">note every detail of the eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene watched the man's calm, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressionless face, tried to remember who</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was. By his manner she knew he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, but he was utterly unfamiliar. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection completed, he pursed his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood watching her with a curious detached</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please stop standing there and undo</seg><seg type="columnLine">these straps," she said in sudden anger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you think I'm comfortable here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her words shattered his reverie. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused himself from his thoughts and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sardonic smile, began to loosen her bonds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He place an arm under her shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped her to sit up on the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse my thoughtlessness," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm so little around ladies, I forgot my</seg><seg type="columnLine">manners." He watched her bite her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pain of moving. "The soreness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your muscles will pass soon," he reassured</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She got down from the table gingerly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly about, easing the stiffness</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her limbs. The man's eyes followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, running over her slim, firm body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps it is a good thing you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, after all," he declared suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene looked at him, frowning, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping her memory would flow back any</seg><seg type="columnLine">28	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">minute and she would know what this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wondered at first," he continued, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I decided to take a chance. Now I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be glad. Maybe it is a good idea to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a woman around here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's words made little sense to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene, but she did not like his tone. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up to him, her gaze cool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Dr. Ralph Devere," he put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly before she could speak. "And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is your name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Automatically, she opened her mouth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply. But no words came. Flushing, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So your memory is gone," Devere said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "I guessed as much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, then," Helene declared angrily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"who am I, and where am I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Devere walked toward her. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in the most isolated, forgotten spot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Congo. You are in my laboratory on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an island surround by water. And as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">who you are, that really won't matter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached an insinuating hand for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist. As his fingers touched her bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">midriff, Helene twisted away and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. Her open palm struck Devere full</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mouth, made him curse with pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drew back his fist to hit the red-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, and then he caught himself. Imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately, he was calm, self-controlled again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his black, unblinking eyes sparked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse me, my dear," he said, his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting in an ugly sneer. "I will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so forward again. I will wait for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to me next time, and I warrant I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't have too long to wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised his voice in a shout, "Malu!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malu!" The barrel-chested black came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room at a run at his master's call.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scarcely glancing at Helene, the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode from the room, ordering the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring the girl along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene was shoved roughly down a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, out into the bright sunlight and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">into another building. From the outside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building had looked much the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one that housed Devere's laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but inside it was drastically different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene saw that it was a strange and ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible jail. She was led slowly down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long corridor and made to stop and peer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into each of the strongly barred cells. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures in those cells were monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a nightmare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sight and stench of them made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head reel, her stomach tighten with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nausea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the first cell, a gigantic creature smoth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in gross rolls of fat, lay gasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor. Gnarled, twisted legs too</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak to hold up the vast weight, pawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimlessly at the wooden floor from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, ever renewing a vain attempt to rise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hair had long since fallen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature's skin and its body was covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with livid red patches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what is it?" asked Helene, sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by the unbelievable sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere glanced at her, smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, this, my dear, was once an ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary wild boar. But under my capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">care, you can see how beautifully he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed. I admit, of course, the job</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be improved on, but we all have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next compartment, a creature with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great, swollen belly hobbled awkwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. Its overlong arms trailed the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging like limp, useless appendages. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, sightless eyes bulged from its head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saliva ran in constant driblets from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its gaping mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was one of my pet monkeys/'" ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained Devere, hurrying Helene on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next cell as though he were displaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">priceless thoroughbreds. "And here is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid specimen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a far corner of the cell, a black figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted. Helene could vaguely make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">its monstrous legs, but could see little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up, up! you stupid dango, so we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">admire you," the white man yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hoarse pitiful moan sounded from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark corner. The dark mass of flesh quiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, and then straining and whimpering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tremendous bulk fought to its feet. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood swaying back and forth, having diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty retaining its balance. Its head was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen, bulbous thing without a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear feature except for two tiny red eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every part of the body was distorted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephantine in size, yet clearly this dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">embodiment once had been a human being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That---why this is a man," Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped. "What on earth is this horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE	29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">place? What terrible thing are you doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor savored the horror which</seg><seg type="columnLine">permeated the girl. He watched her shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, tear her gaze from the cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is plain, isn't it," he said. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a few improvements on Nature! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am learning to create men or beasts in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">image I desire. I can make them grow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever size or shape I want."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene drew away from Devere. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievable anyone could do this to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, let alone a fellow man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere laughed mockingly at the sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A world-shaking discovery such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine is not made easily, my dear. Nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally, I can't expect perfection in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning. But each experiment brings</seg><seg type="columnLine">me closer to my~goal. You are letting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">childish emotion of pity blind you to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, worth of what you are seeing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked from Helene to the grotesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">example of his handiwork inside the cell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the expression on his face it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to tell whether he was gloating or</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If this sight upsets you," he continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice a thin, grating rasp, "you should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been here in the beginning. We really</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some unusual sights then, didn't we,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malu ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black's mouth sheared in what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to be a grin. He nodded his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in quick agreement, remembering with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure the distorted bodies which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the cell block.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe the spadework is done now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere declared proudly. I am ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">create a race of supermen, a race of giants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we will see what those scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">nincompoops in the United States and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe will say--after it is too late for</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever they might try to say or do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A STRANGE elation at the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he would do seized the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He turned briskly, strode down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor. He made Helene stop at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell while he gave a full explanation con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning the unfortunate being under inspec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Helene, by now was too sickened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horrors of the place to see clearly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parade of moaning, pain-wracked mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strosities, but Devere continued to dr&amp;g</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her along, his words tumbling out in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasingly excited outpouring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Though she tried to close her ears to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's words, Helene could not escape his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. He foresaw himself as leader of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race of obedient giants, tremendous men</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to do his least bidding, ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreak vengeance on a world he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">was arrayed against him. Though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted mind had mastered the secret of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making flesh, bone and muscle grow far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond its normal limits, she gathered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his explanation, the unnatural process</seg><seg type="columnLine">drained all semblance of mentality from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grotesque subjects, left them great</seg><seg type="columnLine">moronic hulks of flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the sound and stench of the cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">block was behind her and Helene drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulps of fresh air into her lungs. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordeal her captor planned was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning. Fie led her to the next building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thinking she was to be shown more</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful sights, the red-haired girl threw all</seg><seg type="columnLine">her strength into an attempt to jerk loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Malu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She fought silently, desperately. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitted speed and agility against the black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. The slim, gold-skinned girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted, bit, and kicked, hoping by the sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den violence of her attack to slip free. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the power in her lithe body was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing against the native's steel muscles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cuffed her roughly, twisted her back</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it seemed her spine would crack, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then sliding a sweaty arm under her, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked her up, flung her over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The whip would quiet her," Malu</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly suggested, standing with the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">held helplessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There are better ways to do these things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malu," his master said with satisfaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A few hours in the common cell with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginners and she will beg for the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my protecting arms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed coarsely at the sadistic plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">he' was employing to break Helene's spirit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipating the sight of her begging him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take her from the cell at any cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For once, Malu did not show unqualified</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval of his master's ideas. The black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm tightened around the girl's bare thighs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clearly, he considered her too fair a prize</seg><seg type="columnLine">to throw to the doctor's newest prisoners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere knew the thought in Malu's mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instead of being irritated, the native's</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgruntled manner tickled him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">30	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know the effect my first few in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jections have on those men," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">blandly. "Come now, carry her inside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's watch the dangos fight for her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Malu hesitated a moment, but only for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. He, too, was deathly afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this lean, cruel white man and dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppose his will. He walked forward when</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Devere's call two natives inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building threw open the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interior of this structure was greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from the other one Helene -had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken through. Instead of building</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of individual cells, Devere had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed four walls and a roof over a deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectangular pit. The prisoners were placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in this pit for their initial series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of injections. Later, those who survived</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terror of the early treatment and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged worthy of continued study were</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed to another building and placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual cells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A walk around the four sides of the pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed the guards to look down on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges, watch their every move. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only way to get in or out of the pit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">by using a ladder which the guards lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their vantage point. About twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five prisoners milled about on the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. Some of them charged back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth frenziedly, while others staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around with the difficulty of drunken men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They screamed and fought, smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly against each other and against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. Occasionally, one would drop to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor jerking convulsively, only to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet again as soon as the fit passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was apparent that. Devere's growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">drug wrought drastic changes in their ner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vous systems and physical structures from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of the first injection. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners were like caged beasts driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad by mistreatment and confinement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though they had not yet been under treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment long enough to lose the look of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the restraints and disciplines by which men</seg><seg type="columnLine">live had shattered under the mental and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodily changes induced by Devere's drug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the doctor's command, guards has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened to drop the ladder into the pit. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrape of the ladder striking the prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor brought instant silence. The prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped their pacing, turned their faces up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch the guards above them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowering of the ladder ordinarily meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">more hated injections for the tormented</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">men. The apprehensive faces watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">without understanding as Malu put Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the ladder, forced her to start climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down by stamping his foot on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HELENE halted halfway down, glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the natives waiting below. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill ran through her at the sight of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, tense men who had not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized she was a prisoner also. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up into Devere's sneering counte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nance, knew he expected her to cringe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beg him not to make her enter the pit. See-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his complete lack of normal feeling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the madness in his glittering, inhuman eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she felt a depth of hate and contempt burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her that she never had known before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then calmly, deliberately she made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice. The strange void in her memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept her from knowing who she was or</seg><seg type="columnLine">how she came to be in this place of hell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it did not in the least affect the cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age and self-control which Ki-Gor many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times had admired. Helene went bravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pit, and as she climbed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last few rungs she saw the shocked sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise which flashed over Devere's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was pained at this unexpected turn in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">game which he thought he had planned so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. He wanted only to bluff the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frighten her into cringing obedience, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the little fool betrayed him by choos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to face the prisoners instead of going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her knees to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His chagrin showed plainly. Then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face darkened in anger and clenching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists he sprang to the edge of the pit. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at Helene, his mouth working spas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modically as he fought to speak. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering that Malu and the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were watching him closely, he brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself under control, turned on his heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strode from the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene smiled a thin, fleeting smile at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her triumph, but in the next moment as</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet struck the damp earth, she took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep breath, turned grimly to meet what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever fate awaited her. She stood tautly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to boldly face these abnormal</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings.

About</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the prisoners showed already* the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravages of the growth drug, their features</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickening, their once perfectly propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned bodies beginning to lose their sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metry.

These men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not entirely lost their ability to grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">events around them, but they no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned clearly. They were like drowning</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, floundering and fighting in a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningless burst of strength to save them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene was undecided whether to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the men or stand where she was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind her she heard the ladder pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by the guards. As though the ladder's</seg><seg type="columnLine">removal was signal, a babble of sound went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the prisoners. They began to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward her, converging from all sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HELENE fought off a feeling of panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the strange, unsmiling blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed about her. She managed a calm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly expression, but she dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust her voice to speak. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about these tortured beings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened her, made her flesh crawl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men stood watching her, devouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with their eyes.

Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the tense group, and she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that these prisoners were reduced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle beasts, battered by the growth drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">from men to savage, ruthless creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a ripple of movement as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group stirred and grumbled at the big fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low's unexpected action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a savage growl, a prisoner launched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">himself from the crowd, drove at Helene's</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-appointed master. The powerful black</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready for the onslaught. He smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fists against the smaller man like clubs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as his assailant stumbled, he lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, butted with pile-driving power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The smaller prisoner grunted explosively as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell beneath the shock, then screamed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was picked up, flung bodily over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big man whirled back to his post</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Helene, stood with his shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunched forward, ready to meet any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacker. Helene, upset as siie was, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not help noticing the swift sureness with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the man moved. His balance was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect as that of a normal man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She watched him slash into another chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenger, pound him with lightning blows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell him with a rock-hard right hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded with sudden and terrible accuracy</seg><seg type="columnLine">against an exposed jaw. The man fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a murderous intensity. Though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponents were brutal, powerful fighters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they attacked wildly, without plan or</seg><seg type="columnLine">method. Too, the drug had destroyed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">coordination, made their movements jerky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched, facing his fellow prisoners, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming eyes alert for the least hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">move.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone of the entire group was willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight to the end for this pale-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, and his dreadful ferocity chilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">32	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their ardor for combat.

Now that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were gone, she waited tensely.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a curious thing happened. He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a friendly, reassuring smile, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke, his voice was soft and reassuring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I didn't know how it would go at first,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "but luck was with us and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluffed them off."

Why, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't know me," he said self-accusingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was the same way the first day, but your</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory will come back soon.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a small room with one tiny win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow high up on the wall. Ki-Gor blinked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, slowly became aware of the ache</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his head. He stared at the unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings, wondering at first how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then remembering Devere, he climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet. It 'came to him with a rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Thinking of Malu and the doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face grew flint-hard. A cold fury pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed him.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely held, but this fact caused him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">concern. In the past few days, the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord had suffered much, so much that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was past giving a great deal of importance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his own safety. With both Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George and Helene gone, the taste of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer too good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor thought now not so much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape as revenge.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not caught off guard by the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's attack. The doctor pivoted on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, and crying, "Slam the door," slid into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safety of the hallway. The heavy door</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into place and the bar fell an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant before Ki-Gor struck it.

It was unbelievable a hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could exert such force, and seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brute power of the man, even Devere</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to silence. A trickle of fear ran over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards standing in the hall. Armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were, they had no desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet this raging jungle man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment of uneasiness passed.

An ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited murmur rose from the guards. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not anticipated this treat. Shortly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor heard the heavy sound of foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps in the hall, wondered what new plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">of torture the doctor had now conceived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door to the cell opened wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great bulk stood there completely filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frame. It was a huge, dull-eyed black</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with tremendous sloping shoulders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and long gorilla-like arms. Ki-Gor looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the monster figure and into his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed the picture of the strange creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had hunted with N'Geeso. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a true gorilla, whereas this one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a native. Both misshapen beings, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor realized, were Devere's handiwork.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor did not lie when he said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could control growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring him out, Nyga, but don't kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him," commanded Devere. Then speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Ki-Gor, he said, "It's time for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">first treatment Nyga likes to help me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my patients. Maybe before long you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be a fine, obedient fellow just like</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nyga's grossness revolted Ki-Gor. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">moronic mountain of muscle was obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Devere's more successful experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, an elephantine jailor he used to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">his prisoners into subjection. This, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the kind of creature into which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor'planned to transform him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on, Nyga. Get him!" urged Malu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to see the White Lord brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge black spread his arms slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing them out wide from his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face registered no emotion, no feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He leaned slightly forward, hunching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders, tilting his oddly shaped head</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that his chin sank in folds of fat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle. Then, with ponderous steps, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced on Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord waited, hands at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, while the gigantic black moved cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously toward him. It was clear what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native meant to do. His plan was to scoop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man into his arms, smother the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength from him, carry him away as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master ordered. And to the consternation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the watching guards, Ki-Gor did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">cringe or curse or even move. To all ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearances, he was going to submit without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere watched the spectable, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips thinned in a sneer. So the vaunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord, just as with other men, knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was beaten. Yet the thought was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly in the doctor's mind, when Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A BOLT of lightning was no more dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficult to follow than the jungle man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. He whirled under the black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched arms at the moment Nyga</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE	35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to seize him. He drove with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his might into the native's vast belly, sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder deep in the bulging fat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossus grunted in pain, heaved backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half step. As Nyga raised his hands to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive them down on Ki-Gor's head, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lithe white man slid to the right, smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lower edge of his open hand twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the monster's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Nyga, spurred to greater speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the pain of Ki-Gor's blows, caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man with a sweeping blow of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forearm. The White Lord careened against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall, flung aside like a weightless leaf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew a straight blow from Nyga's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands would shatter his skull or crush his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest with ease. The huge Negro's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulnerable point was his slowness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor crouched, the gray blaze of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes never leaving his adversary. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he threw himself forward again, his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining as he gained terrific momentum</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bare three steps. He lunged in a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive full against the side of Nyga's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg. He struck at the knee, attempting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cripple the black by ripping the tendons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattering the socket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord was successful--too</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful. Nyga gave a hoarse scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Ki-Gor's more than two hundred pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brawn blasted against his knee. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant staggered, and too clumsy to regain</seg><seg type="columnLine">his balance, he toppled in a heap. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster fell headlong on top of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, his crushing weight striking like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsing roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's breath went out of him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rush. He lay dazed by the shock, pinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessly under the massive black body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyga, angered at this first prisoner to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever dare attack him, grunted with hurt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled slowly to his hands and knees. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached roughly for the White Lord, got</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderously to his feet, and jerking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim up with him, raised him high over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere saw that Nyga meant to dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle man against the wall. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned no such sudden end for the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord. The doctor sped forward, small</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the brute he had molded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down! Put him down!" he screamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hurt him and I will have you lashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ant hill, you stupid pig."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nyga came to his senses under the lash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of words. Strangely, he trembled before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor's wrath, meekly lowered Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor. He stood like a whipped child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous and fearful, his dim mind groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover the wrong he had done. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man had hurt him and then when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried to hurt him back, Devere grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry. It was confusing, but Nyga re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selved to even this score with Ki-Gor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time the doctor was not around. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor's abuse, hate for Ki-Gor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">born in the giant, yet now at Devere's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding he carried the White Lord out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cell and down the corridor as carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his clumsy hands permitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR was not unconscious when Nyga</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him into the laboratory, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still stunned. In any case, the remorse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less grip in which he was held made resis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance impossible. As Nyga placed him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, Malu and the doctor quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckled heavy leather straps across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, legs, and chest to bind him firmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere brusquely waved Malu and Nyga</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the room. He studied the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord, busied himself with a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">preliminary tests. He was wholly ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in his work for a time, seeming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that Ki-Gor's cold eyes never left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He paused occasionally to jot down</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes in a small book. When he was fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, the absorbed look left his face, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professional air changed back to the mock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, taunting manner Ki-Gor already knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, everything is as I hoped," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, leaning against the table. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">a splendid subject. Exactly what I needed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cocked his head to the side, rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chin thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are the first white man I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated," Devere confided. "That's quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">an honor. Frankly, I put a lot of faith in</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. These blacks Kalido sends me go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces too quickly. I believe you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand up a lot longer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He reflected on his words, watching to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Ki-Gor's reaction. When no comment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forthcoming from the White Lord, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh, between us, from the physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">standpoint, my experiments have been suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful. Take Nyga, for instance. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a bad job. But I've had trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental side. The injections seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy the mind, no matter what I try."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere straightened up, rubbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">36	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hands together. From his leisurely man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, he was obviously enjoying himself. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pleasant to have one of his own kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to toy with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, well, I'll whip it one of these days,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued. "If not with you, then with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next, maybe. In science, you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect mistakes and failures before you</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally work out your problems."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor lay perfectly still, his face ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressionless. He meant to give this insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">man none of the satisfaction of seeing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">cringe or beg. But knowing that Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived and was in this madman's grasp, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's mind was a ferment of desperation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not, he must not let Devere start</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the road to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must escape. And yet, though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts raced to find some solution, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor knew there was none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE White Lord had faced danger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">death many times, and always there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been some choice he could make. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways there had been a chance, however</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim, he could take. This time he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing. He was utterly powerless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No possible avenue of escape was open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Devere walked away from him now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor watched the doctor go to a basin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully wash his hands. He saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">open a cabinet, take out a glass object</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted with a long needle. It was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypodermic needle Ki-Gor had ever seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he guessed its purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere inspected the needle closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned. Something about it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">please him. From a large bottle of distilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, he filled a small container. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he filled the needle to test it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This cursed climate ruins everything,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suddenly sputtered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angrily, he put the water-filled needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on a small work table, went back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabinet and took out another hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dermic. The new one functioned to suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, so he picked up a small black bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed with wax, opened it, filled the hy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">podermic from it with a clear liquid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor felt his throat muscles constrict</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the doctor walked toward him. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wrhite Lord, this was the end of hope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He watched Devere's deliberately slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, and though he felt his brain must</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst with tension, he gritted his teeth,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">held himself in such iron control he showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no single trace of emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Devere was almost at the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices sounded in the hall outside the lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One voice was especially loud and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited. The doctor stopped, listened in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently. Then a smile crept over his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He regarded the hypodermic needle, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it down carefully, on the table beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, turned and strode from the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This unexpected reprieve took the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord by surprise. Seconds passed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he collected himself. He took a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, drew up every ounce of his strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mighty effort to snap the leather bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that held him. The great muscles of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms writhed and twisted, then set hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he tried to jerk free. Blood swept into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face and veins stood out on his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head with the strain. He twisted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned until his body ached with the agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the bonds held. Devere had built</seg><seg type="columnLine">this table for hysterical, fear-crazed pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tients, and he had done his job well. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor, with all his unleashed jungle power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he could never break free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the blackness of this knowledge, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord sank back on the table. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay still and tense, listening for the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would tell him of Devere's return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His keen ears picked up and magnified the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least sound as he waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, abruptly, he caught his breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was that sound? It came again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more distinctly now. There was no mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking it. It was a monkey's nervous, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed chatter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor raised his head as far as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, and down at the end of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw Helene's pet monkey move from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a stack of boxes. In the confusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day before when Malu and Devere</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked Ki-Gor, the monkey fled behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boxes, and forgotten, the frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">little creature remained there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because of his fear of Devere, Boko</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed in hiding as long as the doctor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room with Ki-Gor. Now that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew Helene was a prisoner, the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord understood Boko's fear of the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. Apparently, the man and his ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant, Malu, had mistreated the monkey</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they first captured Helene. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an idea they had tossed Boko from</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE	37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe when Helene first arrived, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drown him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE pet scrambled down the boxes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried to Ki-Gor. He peered hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily into the White Lord's face, chattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with delight.. Boko snuggled against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master, and obviously reassured, was quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time. But monkey-like, he soon be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came restless, began to prowl around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gleaming hypodermic needle lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Devere had left it on the table be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Ki-Gor caught Boko's eye. He in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected the shining object, gingerly picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it/up. Then, as though sensing the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">trinket was connected with the hated doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor, he hastily put it down, retreated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step. Curiosity soon got the best of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reaching out again, Boko retrieved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's eyes were on the monkey, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hardly noted what the pet did. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord's mind was turned inward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts racing back to the clearing by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silver River, to the peaceful, joy-filled days</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Helene that he would know no more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw his flame-haired mate running to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greet him when he returned from the hunt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw her full lips pout as he teased</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. He heard her soft, warm voice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she called his name. All the countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">small things of their life together pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in upon him in torturing clearness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">even remembered her pleased expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning he brought her Boko, a. fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened little waif whose mother had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey to a leopard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's thoughts were abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched from the past. He was staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Boko. The monkey turned the gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hypodermic back and forth in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene's pet was his one slim hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape! In thinking of Helene, he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">also of the stratagem which might yet out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wit Devere. How many times had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched Boko retrieve small objects at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen's command? If the monkey W'ould</seg><seg type="columnLine">obey his orders, there was still time per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps to escape the fate the madman planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord twisted his head, stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room to the small table where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere had discarded the faulty hypoder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mic. It looked no different from the needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boko held so far as Ki-Gor could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Some tiny evidence of rust, some minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">defect caused Devere to cast it aside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor might never notice a switch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">needles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go, Boko, go!" Ki-Gor hissed, jerking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head in the direction of the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pet stopped playing, glanced at Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor in surprise. He cocked his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the jungle man curiously. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were the same ones his mistress</seg><seg type="columnLine">used when they romped with sticks, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never heard the White Lord use</seg><seg type="columnLine">them before. His button-eyes brightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">•as he decided Ki-Gor really meant he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boko leaped from the table, scampered</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the floor. He stopped from time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time to look back, see whether Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant him to go further. In his excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the monkey held tightly to the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypodermic. Only once did he start to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it down, and then Ki-Gor, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly anxious, urged the pet to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving, and in obeying, Boko retained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold on the needle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> W'hen the monkey reached the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">table on which lay the hypodermic filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with harmless water, Ki-Gor called, "Up!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up!" Boko hesitated, bewildered by Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's inability to give him any hand sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nals, any hints as to where he wanted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go. Twice more the White Lord urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monkey to climb the table, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature became ever more confused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor saw his last chance for life slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping away. He bit his lips, casting des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately for a way to get Boko to do what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted. And then of his own accord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boko did what Ki-Gor desired. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited monkey, with a quick leap, bounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table top.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of the second hypodermic caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention. He reached for it with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same hand that held the deadly needle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The monkey hesitated a brief moment, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough for Ki-Gor's heart to skip a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat, then swiftly the little creature put</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the needle he held, snatched up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boko held the water-filled hypodermic</seg><seg type="columnLine">up triumphantly, whirled about, leaped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">38	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, came racing to the White Lord.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He chattered happily, anticipating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">praise he would receive. The monkey</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded up beside Ki-Gor, laid his find</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly on the stable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Ki - Gor could say a word, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey stiffened. Ki-Gor tensed, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere's crisp, cold voice sounded outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.- He was returning, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him came a native, a black who laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with delight at the doctor's words. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor listened and knew that Kalido had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to gloat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The frightened monkey scampered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding at the end of the laboratory as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men entered the door. The Wasuli</seg><seg type="columnLine">king, moving with conscious arrogance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode completely around the helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord, his lips twisted in an ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">smirk. Devere watched appreciatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So? Is this the lion of the jungle all</seg><seg type="columnLine">men fear?" asked Kalido tauntingly. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">this the great Ki-Gor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wasuli turned to Devere, pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scornful finger at the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be good to see him change into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blubbering, obedient elephant.

Seeing Kalido unmasked, he real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized for the first time the terrible hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wasuli ruler had concealed. This man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had allied himself with Devere to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and in his climb he had stopped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. But Ki-Gor held himself in suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessfully, determined not to give Kalido</seg><seg type="columnLine">the satisfaction of seeing his darts strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was preparing to give him his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot," Devere said, picking up the hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dermic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's mouth grew dry with tension</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he waited to see whether the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would notice the shift of needles. Engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in talking, Devere hardly glanced at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Kalido asked how the drug would</seg><seg type="columnLine">affect the jungle man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The shock will put him to sleep imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately.

I want you to let me send</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down the River of Silence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor shook his head against this</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion. It was too soon to risk having</seg><seg type="columnLine">another prominent warrior fall sick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave him alone," Devere ordered. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't know anything. He can't learn any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. You are foolish to fear a dumb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">childish pygmy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Ki-Gor, listening to the conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, smiled inwardly. If N'Geeso, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily despised the Wasuli, was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging around the village, then he did, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, have his suspicions aroused. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">information gave the White Lord a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction. N'Geeso would never rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he found what he sought, and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, though the White Lord might not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive to see it, the trail would lead to Kalido</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Devere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ki-Gor put N'Geeso from his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time being.

Craftily, he played the part ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected of him. He lunged against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather bonds, fought desperately to tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. His jaw was set and grim, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming with hate. And Devere, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking detachment, jabbed the needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, stood calmly waiting for the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord fought on for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough for Devere to put the needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside still without more than a glance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the jungle man fell back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MONSTERS OF VOO DOO ISLE	39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">table, lay limp and motionless. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed.

The huge man-beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">came with heavy footsteps, lumbering into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, shifting uneasily on his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs as Devere untied Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THOUGH his eyes were closed, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor followed every move made in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room through his keen sense of smell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing. He knew when Devere walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him that he would be free of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds in another minute. Mentally, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">debated the course he should take. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">every instinct urged him to leap on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, batter the crazed, inhuman man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pulp. Every heritage of the jungle told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to rip his tormentor to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he controlled himself. His personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting with Devere must wait yet a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must think first of Helene and Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, and in order to save them, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed more of a chance to escape than</seg><seg type="columnLine">at present presented itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, Nyga with his resistless</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength blocked the door. Nearby stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalido, a long Wasuli knife sheathed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his waist, a blade he would be only too</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to bring into play. Ki-Gor had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of them, but he realized they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off his escape, delay him until help</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came. If he failed, there would be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">second chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Ki-Gor lay limp, unresisting, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere had Nyga picked him and carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the room. With his unerring</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of direction, the White Lord guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance he was being taken back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same cell. He heard the door creak open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed no reaction as Nyga clumsily</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried him into the room, dumped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">unceremoniously on the cold floor. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door slammed shut, he heard Devere</seg><seg type="columnLine">order the hulking brute to stay there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand guard. Then Devere's footsteps re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded into the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor remained quiet a long while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His return to this room was something he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not counted on. His spirits sank. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">predicament was almost as bad as before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would never be able to break out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this cell, and eventually Devere would guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">his deception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a strange fact 'broke on his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness. It was a thing a civilized man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have noticed, for it had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with Nyga's heavy scent. Emotions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear and anger cause a subtle shift in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scent of a man or an animal, and Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor became aware that the huge black</seg><seg type="columnLine">was boiling with fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord opened his eyes to tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">slits, and looking at the small panel in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, he saw Nyga's enraged face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized with a start that he was the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject of the brute's hate. Nyga had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten his battle with Ki-Gor in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and now with his feared master out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight, he lusted for an opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with the white man who had dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An idea took form in Ki-Gor's mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had tried once to smash the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed. The barrier was too formid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able for his muscles to shatter. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible power of the behemoth who</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at him could make kindling of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">timbers. If he could tantalize Nyga into</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking into the room, he might be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to elude the unwieldy black and break</seg><seg type="columnLine">free. It must be done quickly, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the noise brought Devere and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor sprang up, dashed forward snar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling, smashed his hand into Nyga's dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">features. Taken completely offguard, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant grunted with pain. He blinked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">40	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, slow to grasp the fact that the hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man had come alive, was actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking trouble. Then he bellowed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nyga stood back from the door. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose mouth twitched, began to dribbe sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liva. His eyes rolled wildly. Completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten was Devere, gone any fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the penalty the doctor would assess if Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor were injured. Nyga was obsessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the desire to kill. He had suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this pygmy's hands before, and now this</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstart dared challenge him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nyga pulled awkwardly at the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere had locked it, in addition to drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the large crossbar. The maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute wasted no time trying to puzzle a</seg><seg type="columnLine">means to open it. He backed away, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge step forward, threw all his immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight against the barrier. It crackled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sagged. Nyga growled at the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacle, wheeled back, lunged again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door blasted from its hinges, ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart under the monster's charge. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyga, propelled by the ferocity of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own attack, half-stumbled, half-fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cell as broken wood clattered against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls and floor. He bellowed again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his inhuman, bloodcurdling tones reverber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor crouched against the back wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim and tense as the leviathan burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the timbers. The giant recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his balance, heaved up to his full height.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyga's shoulder was smeared with blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the skin had ripped away when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the door, but he gave it no notice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His full attention was centered on the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord. His inflamed eyes in their puffy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sockets were those of a crazed beast. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, sagging belly worked with excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.	/</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nyga spraddled his huge legs to steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. His ham-like hands were knotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into immense clubs. He was visibly gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself to drive at his cornered quarry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disable him with one charge. Yet Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited motionless, his arms pressed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wall, his weaponless hands wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread against the wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NARROWLY, Ki-Gor watched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill-crazed opponent drawing on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct born of countless battles to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him when and how to act. Then as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first slight shift of the giant's shoulder told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him Nyga was closing it, the jungle man</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved with lightning speed. With his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, he shoved away from the wall, gain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an impetus which had him running</seg><seg type="columnLine">full speed by his second step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord darted toward the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the instant Nyga plunged forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He raced as though he meant to skirt past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant. The monster saw his intent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted with immense effort the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his charge, straining to reach the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hurled his vast bulk to pin Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the side wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But again the jungle man outwitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyga. His perfectly coordinated body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was keyed to carry through this stratagem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only possible device which could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him past the black in these crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor wheeled almost in full stride,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now every atom of strength in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel-muscled legs flared into use. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversed himself, racing back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall he had just left. The unwieldy giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to shift his course for the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, tried to follow the jungle man, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his awkward, clumsy legs could not match</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smaller man's maneuver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That brief interval in which Nyga was</seg><seg type="columnLine">off balance, unable to wheel to block him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Ki-Gor's objective. The lithe White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord swerved toward the right hand wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and driving w'ith terrific speed, he shot past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge black, darted through the shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered door into the hall. Turning the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite way from the laboratory, he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">full tilt toward the end of the hall where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the gleam of sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped at the door, puzzled as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to find Helene and Tembu George.

There was no turning back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no alternative, and knowing this he shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin-deep veneer of civilization ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired from Helene, fought with the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible, explosive fury of a jungle killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fingers dug into the native's throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched deep as though to choke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life from him.

"Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the white girl? Speak or you die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terror was in the native's eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight was gone from him. His torn throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles worked spasmodically as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained to speak. His words were a faint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There," he said, pointing feebly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building which housed the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor lifted the native's head a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance above the hard-packed ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then dashed it back. The Wasuli went</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp, the blow knocking him unconscious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor pulled the man's long, curved knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its sheath, snatched up the spear. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasuli would give no alarm for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord started to run to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building pointed out by the Wasuli, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low, murderous outburst behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed his footsteps. He whirled, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyga plow into view. Ki-Gor balanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy spear, gained the feel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon. His arm swung back, steadied</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he awaited the proper moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove forward in the lashing throw of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread Masai spearmen,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NO warrior in the entire Congo could</seg><seg type="columnLine">match the power, the effortless skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his throw. And he threw now to kill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring down this mountain of flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The spear cleft the air cleanly. Sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed once on its bright point, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a jolting thud it hit its mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nyga stumbled, slowed to a walk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. A strange look twisted his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted features.

Only half the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in view. The point had driven com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely through his massive trunk, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truded redly from his back. Nyga stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the shaft and the strength went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his legs. The monstrous figure slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor waited no longer. Without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward glance, he went with long, quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">strides toward Helene's prison. The long</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife shone in his hand. His narrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were the eyes of a stalking lion, hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notic in their searing intensity.

This was the White Lord of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jungle, greatest warrior of the Congo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose very name struck: terror into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, aroused courage and strength in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">42	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came on silent feet to the entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He listened, placing the approximate loca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the two guards who chatted in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the door. Then quietly he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of the door. It moved easily as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried it, so with a sudden tug, he tore it</seg><seg type="columnLine">open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was across the threshold in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap. One startled guard looked up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to see the blurred sweep of the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord's blade. It was the last sight of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. The stroke severed his neck, sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">careening against his fellow in a pulsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">geyser of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second guard swept up his spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to chop down this knife-wielding appari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but the jerking corpse of his fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him, fouled his spear. The White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord bounded at him before he could re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover. Ki-Gor's knife burned the air like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jagged bolt of lightning, stabbed thrice</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the man's chest and belly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor ripped the spear from the guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran forward. He glanced about him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ran, his mouth tightening at this fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther evidence of Devere's cruelty. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the edge of the pit before the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards grasped the meaning of his pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, realized he had cut down the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aaaaiiii," cried one. "It is Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to claim his mate." And there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note of terror in his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then a harsh voice rose above the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice of authority. It was the head guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his words struck the wavering blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the effect of a lash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Kill!" he cried. "Kill or be killed. Stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">him or no man here will see another sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came on then, slowly at first and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then with the growing bravery of a pack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came racing along the narrow ledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their posts around the pit. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time for Ki-Gor to pick out Helene's</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure from the milling, screaming mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. But he knew she was there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His foot caught against a rough surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tripped, fell to his knees. As he fell, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw what caused him to stumble. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladder which the guards used to climb in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of the pit. Without wasting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the quick-witted jungle man</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his spear and knife, caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder and with a powerful tug shoved it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A way of escape lay open for the prison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers below if only he could hold back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards.

His great-thewed legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced, his right arm went back in a short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick arc carrying the spear. Then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">catapult's driving power, he cast the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasuli spear. It thrummed a death song as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cleft the air at terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A running guard screamed as the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanced through his stomach. He leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazily as he ran near the runway's edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slid and fell in a twisting heap. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man directly behind him moved too fast to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop, so he leaped high to clear the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, but the spear Ki-Gor had thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared up from the dying Wasuli's belly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The second native's leg struck the shaft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crashed on his face, rolled once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched headlong into the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's voice rose in the dread war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of the Masai, the chilling, blood cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the fierce warriors utter when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">close with their enemies. He was hurtling</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the one remaining native, straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach him before the man loosed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear. The Wasuli, though, had no inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of letting Ki-Gor close with him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm cocked in mid-stride for the cast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's slitted eyes fastened on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's spear arm, while desperation urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to his greatest effort. He knew he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not reach the Wasuli in time, but still he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove on. Certain death faced him if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, and if he must die, he intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the guard with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then in the rushing span of a pulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat, the White Lord made the one try</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could save him. Too fast for the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow, his red stained knife whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Then it sang toward the native. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the knife with tremendous speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw almost instinctively, and the whirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade cleft the air in its race to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasuli before he cast his spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blade hammered into the black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest even as he swung with the spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw, as he delivered the final thrust of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power into the shaft.

Twisting under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's blow, the warrior bobbled his aim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The spear was diverted enough to send it</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasting past Ki-Gor's right shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor slammed against the grey-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, gave a surging push writh his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders and the Wasuli reeled off the edge o£</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walk, fell screaming into the pit. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord did not break his stride until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached the dropped weapons of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first guard he had cut down.

His eyes were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze of gray fire, his lips a thin, firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">line as he stood poised on the pit's edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His bronzed body, naked but for a breech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clout, was tight-strung as a drawn arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he gauged the grim warriors, weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his next move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far below, the milling prisoners looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and saw the crouching white figure. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time since their imprisonment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw a man face Devere's cruel guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">without fear. And a strange thing hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to those brutalized men, to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-beasts with dim, fading memories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time when they too were free and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence fell over the pit. The snarls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-mad screams of the prisoners dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as though at a signal. Every eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened on the White Lord. Then one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the word. Another took it up. It swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that magic word--over the watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass like the crackle of flame over parched</seg><seg type="columnLine">veldt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ki-Gor! Ki-Gor! Ki-G'or!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again and again they said it. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories of the green jungle, of their home</seg><seg type="columnLine">kraals, of the shadowed paths where men</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked erect, grew and swelled strong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-like in their tortured minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louder and louder swelled the cry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louder until the chant rose dcafeningly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louder until the sound roiled like thunder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And high above them Ki-Gor heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising surge of their'voices. He heard them</seg><seg type="columnLine">call his name over and over, and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him flamed a strength that was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own. The running guards heard the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> shattering chant and in their ears it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnified even more for there was a terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble faith and hope and certainty in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder of those voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SENSITIVE as a jungle creature, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor watched the guards, felt the invol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">untary fear which the sound loosed in them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw them falter as they passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point where he had flung down the ladder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The battering emotion of the prisoners dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted them, filled them with a rush of</seg><seg type="columnLine">misgivings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Ki-Gor in that moment launched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear with blasting power at the tight pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of guards. He threw the spear and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it left his hand he was racing after</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, pounding toward the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasuli.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They saw him flash into action, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries that went unheard in the tumult, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men cast their spears. But the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a twisting, turning target as he sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them. Ki-Gor's spear drove full</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a guard's mouth, ripped through to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear away part of the next man's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Ki-Gor was close against the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, his knife whistling as he parried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard's spear thrust, chopped through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft with a bone-shattering blow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man swung with the broken shaft, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing, shifting White Lord melted be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the attack, swung back and under to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slash a deep wound across the warrior's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fear and pain whipped the guard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater effort, and despite his gashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach, he swung the length of wood with</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate quickness. The shaft caught Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor across the chest and he staggered back</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the terrible blow. He fought to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet, but the breath was gone from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs. His eyes blurred with dizzy nausea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His legs buckled and he fell to his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard tried to finish the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord, raised the spear shaft to strike again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the wash of blood from his wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept away his strength.

Through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist, Ki-Gor saw the man fall, knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other blacks would be on him in a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reared to his feet drunkenly, held erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">through sheer will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wasuli dashed at him, their grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces lighting with the knowledge he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt.

It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of wrath and fury that rang above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all else. And dimly behind the guard, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor saw a huge black figure catapult from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top rung of the ladder, mount the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pit. Almost in the same motion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant black sent his spear at the Wasuli</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest Ki-Gor. The spear caught the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the back, lifted him from his feet, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him completely past the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other Wasuli wheeled at the abrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergence of this new enemy.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasuli gaped at this fierce apparition from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit, hesitated a moment too long, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Masai Chieftain's knife chopped half</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skull away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's eyes were clearing now and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Helene swing over the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit.

With a scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terror, he heaved to his feet, started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run toward the door. A snarling mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed around him, bore him down, battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tembu George started for Ki-Gor, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing Helene's glad cry, he stood aside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The red-haired girl ran to her mate, anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious as she suddenly saw the red welt</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his chest.

His tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner vitality already had restored his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. The blow he took dazed him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rock-like chest muscles had cushioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock which would have crushed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">average man.

Their fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards was gone, replaced by a burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to kill. With only their bare hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fighting, the strange pack drove over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fallen comrades, raced at the Wasuli.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brutes struck the line of warriors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and such was the shock of their clawing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing charge that the Wasuli reeled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it.

And though they died, they dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasuli with them into death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet flesh cannot stand against steel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged on by Devere and Kalido, the Wasuli</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed their ranks and stood firm. The bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle swirled and eddied, and then the thin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning prisoners began to fall back. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard's knives were too much, and though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor and Tembu George cut a swath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death about them, they too had to retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the others or be surrounded-.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly, the prisoners gave up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unequal struggle.

As the monsters careened closer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, Tembu George opened the back door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the way into the open air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as he stepped from the building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried a warning to his companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere, Kalido and a band of Wasuli stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting.

These</seg><seg type="columnLine">three had cost him trouble enough with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third of his guards dead, his experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined. He swung the flat of the Wasuli</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife he held on the guards' shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get them, you cowards," he screamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His words were drowned in the rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling roar of the hideous giant that plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the building, stood blinking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight. The creature twisted his bulbous</seg><seg type="columnLine">head as the scent of blood struck him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the Wasuli warriors and made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The men turned and ran, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere ran back a few steps. Then as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster went by, Ki-Gor leaped at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor before the man gathered his wits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Too late Devere realized he must face</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord alone.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">goaded by desperation, he threw caution</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the winds, went to meet Ki-Gor, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his long Wasuli knife like a saber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice Ki-Gor parried the doctor's blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">without trying to attack. Then as he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same thing again, Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned. But when on the fourth clash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blade, Ki-Gor twisted his hand, sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere's knife singing through the air, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai leader smiled appreciatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut him to ribbons," Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">46	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">urged, feeling no mercy for the cruel white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere paled, realizing how close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death he was. Ki-Gor's features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly expressionless as he stood holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the razor-sharp blade an inch from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor's throat. Suddenly, Ki-Gor pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devere's eyes gleamed. The fool thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to beat him with his fists.

The man pitched backward, his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">split and torn. As he jumped to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried to kick the jungle man in the groin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again he failed and again that rock-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand exploded in his face. Ki-Gor smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and battered Devere back and forth over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood-spattered ground until the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell flat, began to crawl whimpering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the splintering crash of wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another great beast heaved, wild-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bellowing, from the building.

De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vere, on the other hand crawled rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where his knife had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor stood with his back to the doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George and Helene were stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the building, watching the giant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devere came painfully to his feet, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run at the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DEVERE'S action caught the monster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention.

It bore down on Devere with</seg><seg type="columnLine">express train speed. The giant's huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawing hands snatched up the doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally twisted him in half, tossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken body fifty feet away. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster ran forward to stamp the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">remnant of the man into the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene gasped at the sickening sight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Tembu George turned away.

Studying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body a moment, he finally returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit's rim and rejoined the apprehensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no evil jungle spirit in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit," he said reassuringly. "I have seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the stench, Bwana--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come with me and I will show you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne told him. "There is no danger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'glana hesitated. The Zulu was puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled, unsure. When he followed the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man down into the pit at last, his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tight and ready on the handle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-drawn throwing knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEATH-PLAGUE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell back a step, his face shocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bleak, as Wayne pointed out the rot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting corpse to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mooli!" he cried. "It is the worker we</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought had deserted us a few suns past!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Walt," nodded Wayne. "It is what re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains of Mooli. He was clawed and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a lion, and he fell down into this pit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His body lay hidden from your sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodged behind this great stone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clawed by a lion . . .?" N'glana's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a horrified gasp. Instinctively, he ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured in tribal counter-magic. "Gimshai</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his cursed lion-monster hath returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">then after all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You speak child-chatter," scoffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne. "Mooli's death was an accident</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequent to this lion-country of Mata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gara. A man is foolish who wanders this</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush alone at night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have heard stories, Bwana!" Fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled excitement harshened N'glana's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones. "Gimshai has returned to bring ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror upon Mata-Gara as in the past. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eater of Souls begins--as this--by stealth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet soon this bush will shake to the endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring of Gimshai's juju-lion. It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring death--and yet worse than death--</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all of us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Silence, N'glana," ordered Wayne in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp voice. "I never thought you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe the wild stories fools tell at cooking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires. Go now to the bungalow. Return</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your men. We must bury Mooli."</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glana eyed him tensely. He said no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, but turned away to fetch the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They returned with him. In a numbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, they tended to the putrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse and buried it in the jungle growths</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far from the pit. And the hot, moist</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze that had carried the stench of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death as far as the bungalow clearing, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed the odor away. The air became</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of the dead. Only the familiar smells</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AYNE talked to the men then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and earnestly--until they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wisdom of his reasoning and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their labors in the gold pit. Being</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawed to death by a lion, as he had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier, was not an uncommon occurrence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Mata-Gara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Wayne wasn't entirely convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself when he returned to his bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A--Jungle Stories--Spring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF MATA-GARA	49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He had made a close examination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw marks that had torn the corpse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was obvious Mooli had been struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by some tremendous beast. The claw</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread had been fully three times that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest lion he had ever seen . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Wayne had lived most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-five years in Africa. He had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lost more than one fortune in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">career of prospecting and mining in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive Congo areas, and it was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast town that he heard about the fabu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous Mata-Gara claims. He had a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the government record regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines, and was intrigued when it was said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mines couldn't be worked and were up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for sale at a pittance. Someone else was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding on the mines, so he borrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">money and beat out this competitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're sunk, Tony," a friend told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward. "Machinery can't even be flown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that wild region, and you'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rely on natives to dig for you. Worse, it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">juju country. They got a very potent</seg><seg type="columnLine">brand of black magic there that's made</seg><seg type="columnLine">other owners fail. It'll stop you, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see," grinned Wayne. "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">my jungle, Mister. If the gold's there, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it out . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't until he got to Leopoldville on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first leg of his journey to Mata-Gara</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he got his first concrete information</seg><seg type="columnLine">about what might be in store for him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran into DuVal there. DuVal was a blocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Frenchman he knew from way back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sacre nom de nom!" gasped DuVal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he learned where Wayne was headed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're in for hell.

Wayne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd be better off if you sold those hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings for whatever you can get."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to know a lot about it, Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Val"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do. Davis, the last owner, hired me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for him. I know the kind of hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's happened there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne stared. "What d'you mean--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Juju!" hissed the Frenchman. "Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives there say Gimshai, the Eater of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Souls, protects that bush from all white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Gimshai and his big juju lion is sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to finish off any white that comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">SO	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">licked Davis like it licked others before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him:--and like it's going to lick you.

"I want to be sure that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body is me . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did a lot of talking that night. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of drinking, too. Before the evening was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, and that was close to dawn, Wayne</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gotten DuVal's promise to go along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. He offered DuVal a big share</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mines--but only in the event the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation was black as the little Frenchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">had painted, and that they overcame the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perils together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must have swilled too much cognac</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night," DuVal growled to Wayne the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning. He had a pounding head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remorse, too, it seemed. "Only a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">would return to Mata-Gara. But I stick to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my word. If I signed the agreement with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, I'll go through with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I promise you no regrets," laugbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne. "We'll make a good team to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO it was they set out together for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild jungles of Mata-Gara. They trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled with one other companion--N'glana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zulu, who had been highly recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mended to Wayne as a guide and all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">round capable bush-man. And they reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">their destination swiftly and without mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mines were located along a river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing ten miles apart from each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number One was a hillside tunnel, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second mine was a series of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow pits set in about the thickest jun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle Wayne had ever seen. His first in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection of the mines proved two things--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were in as terrible shape as Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Val had said, and that the mines were rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm putting you, DuVal, in charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mine Number One," he said. "I'll see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I can do at the pits."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which was the beginning of a month of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell. It would have been difficult enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting the mines in order with experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">white crews. The natives that peopled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district were lazy and sullen, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of civilized methods and customs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Wayne and DuVal were too much of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle veterans to pamper the blacks as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis, the former owner, had done. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove the workers without mercy. And by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of thirty days, the mines were op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erating somewhat efficiently, giving prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise of ultimate results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Wayne had found the corpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood a long while on the bungalow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffing silently at his pipe, his eyes study-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the quiet native huts in the clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. Inwardly, he cursed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for imagining crazy thoughts about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous claw-marks he'd seen on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mooli's torn remains. No lion was large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to have a paw like that. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer was that the swelling of the corpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">had distended the skin, thus enlarging what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been normal claw-marks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the way it was," he muttered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "I'm sure of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he wasn't sure. And with uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty came worry. The only sensible thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, would be to go and talk to Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Val, who had been through this before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took his rifle in the crook of his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left his bungalow. He headed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crooked jungle trail, passed beneath some</seg><seg type="columnLine">moss-draped baobab trees, until he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the place where some half-dozen native</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes were drawn up on the bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murky-watered river. Disturbed apes</seg><seg type="columnLine">scolded him from the trees, rousing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny sunbirds which flushed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river like flashing iridescent light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Wayne shoved one of the canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the river. He leaped into it and stroked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the paddle, sending the light craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly down-stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His was the automatic, untiring stroke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man accustomed to jungle travel. Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance melted away behind him, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long before he came into the lush hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tangled bush where Mine Number One</seg><seg type="columnLine">was located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that death rode the air again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One moment the gentle breeze sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet scent of maheena blooms drifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the river. In the next, all this fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grance was suddenly blotted out by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible stench of putrifying dead bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The change was so unnatural and hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible a chill rippled down Wayne's spine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shook off his wild thoughts, slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his canoe, circling the river as he searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shores for signs of a rotting corpse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEATH-PLAGUE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no corpse in the vicinity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was convinced of it when he resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his course toward the mine, for the stench</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not lessen in the air. It was like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil pall over the jungle, and he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself thinking again of Gimshai, the aw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful native god of Death which they call</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eater of Souls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he paddled up to the flat river</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank where other canoes were beached,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped out and pulled his craft up beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Then he set out along the well-trod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den trail that led to the hillside where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine was located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A small native village stood at the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the low hill. Reaching there, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sickened by the stench of death in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. Horror and fear hung over the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Black men walked the kraal ner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vously, their labors in the mine forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fear had tightened their faces, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">held their clenched hands close to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuVal came out to meet Wayne. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the blocky little Frenchman was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim and tight-set as the features of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebony workmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Well?" said Wayne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nom du Diable!" cried DuVal. "It has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come like a sudden thunderbolt. Yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, all was serene and happy. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five men lay sick to death of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer fever that has struck at us overnight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that is not the worst. Gimshai--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't believe native mumbo-jum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bo!" gritted Wayne. "There is some logi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal explanation for all that is happening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Someone is---"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuVal held up his hand. "Wait, Wayne.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want you to see something else first</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you argue the point. Come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and I'll show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne eyed him a long minute, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">wordlessly began following the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman. Silent natives stepped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way as DuVal walked from the kraal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following a narrow overgrown trail which</seg><seg type="columnLine">led off to the south. It was the trail that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the village water hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuVal stopped at the water hole to</seg><seg type="columnLine">point out the ghastly thing that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it. It was a twisted corpse of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black man who had obviously been mauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a lion. And for a nerve - crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, Wayne stared at the horribly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF MATA-GARA	51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">torn body. Claw-marks were plain on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse--claw-marks larger than any ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary lion would make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you still have doubt, examine this,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuVal said in a thick tone. He stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and pointed at the marks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boggy earth alongside the water hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne's blood turned to ice in his veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he studied the marks. They were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks of a gigantic lion--one that must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the size of a water buffalo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now do you disbelieve?" DuVal asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Now do you see why I begged you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sell these mines ? It's something a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man can't lick. Jungle magic that--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jungle magic or hell itself isn't going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lick me!" Wayne told him in a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. His lean face was granite-hard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenging. "I can fight, too, and don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">give a damn whether it's men or devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me. DuVal, I intend to get these</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines going, or--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice broke off as a lion bellowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the nearby bush. It was a hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattering din like the familiar warning cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the king of beasts--except that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen times louder than any lion's roar!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There it is! The roar of Gimshai's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed juju lion!" shouted DuVal in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking voice. "We better get out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mata-Gara bush before Gimshai brings us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our ends!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne hardly heard the Frenchman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzied cries. A great rage swept him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he swung his rifle from his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He levered a cartridge into the chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">DuVal stared. "Diable, what are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you . . . ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going hunting," Wayne growled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grimly set off in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring lion. With no thought of personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger he plunged into the tangled under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of the jungle in search of the fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he cautiously stalked through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness, the lion momentarily stilled its</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud roaring. He sensed that the beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become aware of him. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. The roar of the lion sounded again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time from a distance south of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cursing, he turned in that direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His one passion was to get face to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the awful lion and slay it. The beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, seemed to elude him, its roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming first on one side of him, then upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. Yet Wayne kept relentlessly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">52	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its trail, his Winchester poised and ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his sweaty fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long while he kept on, until all</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once he noticed the lion was a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance from him, roaring way back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicinity where he had started his search.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He became furious with angry frustration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was uncanny how a lion could shift its</seg><seg type="columnLine">position so swiftly. Lions ordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The realization chilled him that perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives were right. Perhaps this lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a living thing, but something con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured up by the dreadful Gimshai!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> .Yet he knew it was only his frenzied</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger that was making him think such</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. He turned and trudged back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance to the mine. And as he walked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was taunted by the distant challenge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE did not resume the hunt upon his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the mine. The blacks stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups, watching him in fearful silence as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he entered their kraal. DuVal was waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, too, and Wayne walked grimly up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't get near the lion," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a strained, quiet tone. "Now let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine your sick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DuVal said nothing. Soberly he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne on a round of the huts, showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the stricken men. Two of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly, were dying. It was a vomiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease that afflicted them, accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever. Wayne had seen nothing like it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. But he said nothing about it. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he comment on the strange fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness had come with that unexplainable</seg><seg type="columnLine">stench of the dead that was in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Treat them the best you can, DuVal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Use what drugs you have. It's all we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do," he said finally, and walked abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the sunshine again. The roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lion reverberated the bush once more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the black natives began wailing weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayers to their gods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne hardly listened to any of this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was concerned over the other mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If things were happening here, trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be brewing up-river, too. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a jogging run to his canoe. He shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out to the current as he leaped in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began paddling with swift, powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a relief to get- out of the foul</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">odors that hung over the mine. Yet, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time later when he drew close to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, his jaw went hard--because that</seg><seg type="columnLine">same vile, sickening death-stench was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Worse, that horrible lion beast seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have preceded him there, for the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise of its roaring was chilling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'glana was waiting at the river bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Wayne pulled his canoe up. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zulu stood motionless, his weapons in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Peculiarly, the fear that had so char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acterized him earlier was absent from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want speech with thee, Bwana," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know about what's happening," Wayne</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped irritably. "You're going to tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was wrong--that Gimshai and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion-beast is stalking this bushland for us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know, only that it is the will of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods that we fight or die. But we cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">do battle alone. Bwana, I know of a brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe that lives not a great march from</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. I can go and fetch them here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight beside thee."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne turned on him skeptically. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fear Gimshai, the Eater of Souls?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wah, all jungle people fear Gimshai."</seg><seg type="columnLine">' "Then they would be useless here. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fear death as the others," Wayne</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in disgust, and walked up the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And new rage rose within him when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came striding into the native kraal. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine workmen were assembled there. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had deserted their labors in the pits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the reason for this?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded loudly as he strode among them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why are you not in the pits?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them faced him sullenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "The smell of death is around us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The juju lion walks the bush, ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obey Gimshai's every command."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wah. Return to your work lest trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black man did not move. "Trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">will start if we do. It is our plan to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">6ut of the pits---to avoid all white-man</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Gimshai will not harm us then."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne's lips tightened. His nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed eyes studied the tense, sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">company before him. They were jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, always dangerous as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpredictable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEATH-PLAGUE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I command you, return into the pits."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dead cannot command, Bwana!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried the black. He leaped toward Wayne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knife flashing from his girdle. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was murder in his blazing, distended gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne moved with fluid speed, firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the heads of the blacks. The rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundered like ordnance in the kraal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped the men in their tracks for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Wayne stood unafraid before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, his face cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You and your numbers could over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power me, but some of you will die with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," he said. "Come forward now if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">Want to die. Next time, I shoot to kill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black men stood undecided, waver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Killing the bwana will bring us noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," calmly spoke the voice of N'glana</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind Wayne. "Nor will it aid us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay out of the pits. Let us return there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have faith in our bwana. He will prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">our deaths. He alone can prevent our</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaths."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long minute, all stood in a grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">tableau. Then a few men began walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the mine road. Others followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until all began trudging back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold pits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'glana's words, Wayne knew, hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought about this obedience. Rather, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the men knew Wayne would kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them before he fell. Each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple-minded blacks had submitted only</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the craven fear that he might be one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them who would die with the bwana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne breathed in relief. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Zulu and said, "I am in your debt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">good N'glana. I will not forget what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'glana made no reply. Silently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked past the white man and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the pits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne turned to his bungalow, sat for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long while on the verandah.- The death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stench was an invisible fog that permeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. Distantly came the roaring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that huge lion. He kept his rifle beside him</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he sensed trouble. If it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from this mysterious menace that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered over the mine, it would rise from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fear-frenzied natives themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day gradually spent itself. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling of darkness, a handful of native</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers emerged from the pits road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the kraal. Puzzled, Wayne went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF MATA-GARA	53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the cooking fires and asked them</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are not returning," one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks said. "They have fled into the bush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">believing it offers more safety than thee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bwana."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne hid his disturbed feelings behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">an emotionless face. He asked, "What of</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glana? I do not see the Zulu among</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He went with them," the speaker said</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder as he and his companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped toward their huts. "The Zulu lied</seg><seg type="columnLine">before when he said he trusted you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne stared after them, scowling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With these few faithful workmen, he'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicapped; the mine would fall to ruin</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And DuVal would have similar deser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions at the other diggings. More men</seg><seg type="columnLine">would die horribly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would mean the end to this mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture. Except that Tony Wayne wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a person to give in to defeat. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not submit until he was beaten to hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knees and literally trampled to death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was his nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A full moon rose later, leering down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mata-Gara like a cruel, laughing god and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading a pale, emotionless light over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brooding jungle-land. The huge lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowed in the distance, dimming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus of other lions by its nerve-chilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">vociferation. Behind this came the occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional ghostly cry of leopards, the muted</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieks of hyenas and lemurs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The kraal itself throbbed to the muffled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">funereal beat of tom-toms. Native women</seg><seg type="columnLine">wailed in dreadful monotones, streaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies with ashes. They chanted sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">song entreaties to their gods for safekeep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO weird and fantastic was all this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne sensed a queer foreboding, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightening sensation that nothing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him except death. Desperately he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to thrust the insisting premonition</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay himself down on his cot inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bungalow--not to sleep, but to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">over all the fantastic ramifications of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartbreaking predicament with the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of finding a solution. Yet his weariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifested itself, and he fell sound asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was no pleasant rest. He dreamed of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">54	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible monster that pursued him, mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to devour his very soul. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a start, he awakened. Dazed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror of his dreams, he did not move for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. He had slept long. The kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quiet now. Even the damnable roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that huge lion was stilled. The moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had half-crossed the sky, its bright rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">painting silver squares on the floor be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, abruptly, he realized that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not alone in the room. The snuffled sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breathing came to him; the soft slither-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of naked feet moving cautiously toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cot. And when he rolled his eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right, he caught a glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one of the naked blacks who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted from the pits, and Wayne's</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles tightened when he saw the hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible device the man grasped in his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The war-club was huge, heavy, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, knobbed end was fitted with razor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, hooked knives. Blows with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhuman weapon, Wayne realized, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">simulate lion claw-marks of gigantic size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black man was almost beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cot. He caught his snuffling breath. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hard, muscular stroke, he swept the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-club downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Wayne had moved as fast as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">human could, rolling from the cot as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">club crashed down. The awful hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives raked through the canvas of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cot, the club catching in the cloth momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily. And Wayne was diving across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cot before the cursing murderer could</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislodge his weapon, raining hard, flailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists upon the black man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grunting from the blows, the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled, dashed in mad, frantic flight from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bungalow. Wayne chased after him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the moon-bright darkness. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black man got beyond the clearing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the juiigle swallowed him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne stood a moment at the jungle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, then went striding back to the bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">galow to examine the fallen war-club. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemented into his mind the truth that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery that had befallen the mines was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not supernatural, but vicious and sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, what reason could be behind this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellishness? What motive could these na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives have that prompted them into brutally</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaying people of their own kraal?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An inkling of the truth crept into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled mind then. First he rejected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility scornfully. Nevertheless, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reviewed the past in his mind, he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not be wrong. And it brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">great rage upon him---the will to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an end this horrible business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how to begin? What move . . . ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if in answer to his very pondering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loud, tremendous roaring rose again</seg><seg type="columnLine">from deep in the bush. It was as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gimshai, the Eater of Souls, were hurling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a taunting challenge at this puny, defiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a challenge that Tony Wayne</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted. His face hard and grim, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried out of the bungalow, carrying his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle in the crook of his arm. He gave no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to the added perils one finds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush at night, but plunged purposefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the thick tangle of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The challenging lion-roar kept on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne fought his way through frondiferous</seg><seg type="columnLine">undergrowth, growing louder with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward step. The moon-brightness gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him good visibility in the dark-shadowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush. Noiseless, alert to signs on all sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, he moved anxiously toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilling sound of that tremendous lion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped at last, his lean body tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn, ready, the rifle poised in his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lion-roaring was directly in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, tremendous-sounding as the din of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern waterfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crept slowly forward, and less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten paces took him to the edge of a grassy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlighted glade. A naked black man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seated cross-legged in the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glade, and Wayne recognized him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">another of his deserters. The native had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge war-drum fastened to the earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pulling, over and over, upon the rosined</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord that was fastened to the drumhead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The drum vibrated with awful sound, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth was a soundboard that turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise into a gigantic roaring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tony Wayne stepped silently into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glade and was almost beside the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the black man saw him. Abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black ceased pulling at the drum-cord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the following silence was intense, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most frightening by contrast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne gestured with his rifle. "Stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEATH-PLAGUE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native eyed him, then slowly rose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No fear stood on his black face, merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen insolence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think you can do, Bwana?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the native sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to use you," Wayne snarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. "I'm going to use you to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">DuVal's dirty plot crashing down on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You?" The native laughed mockingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An angry retort leaped to Wayne's lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to wither to a horrified silence when</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly he caught the reason behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black's taunting mockery. The inky</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows on either side of the glade trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed themselves into the shapes of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">---naked, screaming black men who raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, brandishing spears and knives, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened eyes bright in the moonlight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-lust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne fell back a step, whipping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle up to his shoulder. He knew he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked into a death-trap. But he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not intend to die alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet he fired not one shot. In the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citing moment, he was unthinking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had stolen into the glade behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well. A spear-handle struck him</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutally on the head, knocking him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. Then the spear struck a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and all his awareness was abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotted out by a black, hot silence . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment, so it seemed, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself standing erect again. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">return of awareness, he realized he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning against the slanting bole of an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, his arms about the trunk, his wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound together with tonga cords. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives stood in a sullen circle about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching. They watched, too, the blocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Frenchman who was regarding Wayne</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been a fool, Wayne," DuVal</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I gave you a dozen chances to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from under, but you insisted on be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stubborn about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne eyed the blacks, all men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been his workers at the mines.

It was a hide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, crude sculpture of red stone, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its malignant, unblinking gaze brooded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen, evil menace that chilled the hearts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all men who looked upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An old crone in the compound saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters coming down into the village with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ghastly burden, and shrilled out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, pointing toward them. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry brought Guntali men and women hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying from their huts.

And because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was the logical man for the task, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Governor-General had appointed him Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missioner of Tembu-Loma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Jane had done many things for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the district, even taking the N'glanas under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wing after the fierce tribe's trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Guntalis, educating them, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into mine workmen, and training the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more apt into a company of riflemen--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"unofficial soldiers" of his settlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was assembled with these riflemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the workmen settlement of the mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Grimm, the stocky, stiff-spined Aus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trian manager, was beside him, talking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bori, the intelligent, rather sharp-witted</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glana chief, was supervising the depar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, for he was Kirk's headman. Drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">up behind Kirk, waiting, were eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glanas--all hunters--who were deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to him. They were Lakeeto, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">son Gawai, and six other young N'glanas</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were Gawai's close companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then in that moment of bustle and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity, a stunned silence abruptly fell over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicinity. The N'glanas stood in hushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups, staring toward the north edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small jungle basin where the mine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in hell's wrong?" spoke up Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grimm. "Why are the men--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," said Kirk, pointing. "A Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tali warrior's entered the ba'Sin over there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is coming toward us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So there is! I thought you had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreement with Bwalla that no Guntalis</seg><seg type="columnLine">come near this mine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have, and I know Bwalla wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back on his word unless something is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong," muttered Kirk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the charged quiet that hung over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">humid air, he saw the warrior advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer and he recognized him--a Guntalis</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Kunato.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Kunato," he said in Swahili when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior stepped before him, "why do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to this forbidden place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I come to warn you out of this bush,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kunato answered. "We have learned all</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men are enemies, and that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE JUNGLE OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue is forked as that of Ginzina, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk's brown angular jaw tightened.

And he told him of the sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less rifleman who was slaying Guntali hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers from ambush, and of Bwalla's terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning to all white men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KIRK was angered, shocked, learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">that someone was murdering innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives by a rifle fitted with a silencer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is no murder by ghosts, Kunato,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said desperately. "It is plain that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white men in Tembu-Loma--by</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealth unknown to me until now--is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting these killings for some personal mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. Therefore, go back and inform Bwalla</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this moment I am sending out mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers to all the wThite men camps, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structing the whites to assemble at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my official settlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will question all and learn who the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer is.

That is my solemn promise."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kunato smirked. "I will return and tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">my king this, but I know he will not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve your promises.

He vanished into the grove</seg><seg type="columnLine">that partially circled the kraal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glana mine workmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk heard the moans of fear and horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the assembled N'glanas.

He said, "Bwalla merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">used tricks against you, Bori, and you be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved it magic.

"What do you make of this crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, Marty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never lock my storehouses at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement," Kirk replied. "The white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are prospecting around here are free</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take any supplies, food, or arms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they need, because Jane and I are inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in their success.

Kirk's voice be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came hard, brittle. "And one of them is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a murderer.

"Marty, you aren't crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to believe that Bwalla can hokus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pokus a corpse from the grave!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what to think.

I was here in Tembu-Loma when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyua curse was placed on the N'glanas. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw how an epidemic of strange sicknesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">62	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped their kraal, and saw even stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">murders for which I still have no logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meaning we've got to discover the iden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tity of this murderer and prove his guilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bwalla's satisfaction." Grimm's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tight, grave. "Can we do this in ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">days ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll do our best," said Kirk. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">send runners to the camps of these men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. All the camps are within a day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trek of my settlement, and if we set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at once the men should be assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we arrive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We?

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are one man in this jungle whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">I trust. I will need your help in this busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness," nodded Kirk. He turned sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bori, the N'glana chief, so that fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">runners could be dispatched at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER the runners were chosen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent on, Kirk started his two-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">march toward his settlement and home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Bori trudged in the lead of the party.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The white men came next, with Lakeeto,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his son, Gawai, and Gawai's six young</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter companions pacing behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The remainder of the blacks marched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk walked silently, thinking of Jane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife, waiting back there at the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. She was an admirer of Bwalla and</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed the king's tribe were their friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wasn't going to be easy telling her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Guntalis had turned against them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become their enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hours ground by, and the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinned. The trail turned into a ridge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soggy mud, hemmed on both sides by stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant scum-green water dotted with bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren, broken trees that were webbed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly festoons of sickly-gray moss. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp was a morass of crocodiles, hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">horned lizards, and deadly quicksands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the fulsome stench of the swamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailed them, and the N'glanas bunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in fear and quickened their pace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For this was the Swamp of Nyua.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swamp was where the Guntali an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cestor-god was entombed, and every black</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of Tembu-Loma believed that the nau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seating stench exuded from the ancient</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grave itself. It made them shun the dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The soggy trail debouched into a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat plateau. In the center of this unnat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally barren high ground was the pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of weathered rocks that marked Nyua's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave--Nyua, the father of the Guntali</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe, who had died more than a century</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. As the party hurried by, Kirk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were magnetically drawn toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had come through here the last time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the risen Nyua had prowled this jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had seen how the rocks of the grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been thrown aside, and only a yawn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hole had marked the place where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave had been. And getting later to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glana kraal, it seemed the stench of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp had followed him, for the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rank with it. A queer plague of sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses gripped the tribe. Also, he saw how</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentinels of the village had literally been</seg><seg type="columnLine">consumed by fire at their posts, while not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blade of grass about them had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And after the horrible business came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an end, he had seen Nyua's tomb again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks sealing it as before, a grave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared as though it had never been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed these many years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could find no answer to these things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite that he knew King Bawalla was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever enough to resort to tricks and arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fices to fan superstitious minds, both among</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own people and their enemies. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror had been too real, too unexplain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They got past the swamp at last, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more comforting tangle of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness closed in around them again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They trekked till dark, camped, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the trail again before dawn, Kirk goad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them to speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the morning of the next day they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the densely-vegetated slope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the southern boundary of his set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They descended down into the settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, a long, narrow, tree-shaded glen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined on both sides with native huts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">storehouses, while at the east end of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood Kirk's trim, whitewashed bungalow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was his official residence as District</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commissioner of Tembu-Loma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk scowled when they got there, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no sign of the white men whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE JUNGLE OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had summoned to meet him at this place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor had the runners arrived yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't get this," he growled at Grimm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They should have beat us here by a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight to ten hours.

"What-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever happened to your tribe long ago was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guntali trickery, even as this taking of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear wife was Guntali trickery. But I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">match King Bwalla for cleverness. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be stronger than Nyua!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No man is stronger than Nyua," Bori,</seg><seg type="columnLine">64	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the N'glana chief, replied hollowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bwana, our fate is written.

"Bori,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give in to Bwalla's tricks would lose us</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. And I do not mean to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dear wife--not while she still lives and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hard, burning gaze swept over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring black men. His voice was bleak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanding, terrible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men of N'glana," he said, "it is my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan that we march by stealth upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kraal of the Guntalis, for I know that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in their village where I can find Jane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the cover of darkness, we will steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from them.

"And it is my order to you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you return to the mine and arm the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glanas--your workmen--who this min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute are there. You will wait there in read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iness in case of our need."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung away from the mine manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressed a written letter into the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lithe young N'glana who was famed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his speed and endurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run down out of this country to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat-landing where the river turns away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Tembu-Loma," he ordered.

Go directly to the Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor-General's residence when you reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coast.

In a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle swallowed him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chief Bori was looking upon Kirk, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave expression on his fierce, intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">black face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bwana, you cannot do this," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To make us trek now into the bush will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be our deaths."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it not better to die on the trail, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than waiting for Bwalla to murder us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambush?" Kirk retorted harshly. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped nearer him, added dangerously:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am your master.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, lithe steps, he headed back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the residence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY set off that afternoon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trekked all the following day, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next. Noon of that third day found Marty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk and his grimly silent company of</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glanas moving along the trail deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brooding heart of Tembu-Loma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thoughts of lovely golden-haired Jane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl who had been born in Africa and</seg><seg type="columnLine">capably had trekked side by side with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the most perilous trails, tortured Kirk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could think of nothing except her res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cue. It was like a scourge across his naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet he was bewildered that the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talis, through Nyua, would strike first at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane. He was equally bewildered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been taken away instead of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered in some hideous fashion. It al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most seemed part of some kind of coldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What kind of plan ? Was it that Bwalla</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to lure him into the jungle, exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was doing?

And with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane chosen as the enemy victim to be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this ceremony which took place only at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first quarter of the moon. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk swung to Bori, who paced stolidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side. He asked, "When will we see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first quarter of the moon . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dark after tomorrow's sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bwana," Bori told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk's face tightened. It made him sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A bit frantic, too. It would be the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before they reached the Guntali kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and to rescue Jane, they would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get there before the ceremony could begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must press on with haste, O Chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must reach the Guntali village when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun is still in the sky. That is my</seg><seg type="columnLine">command."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bori eyed him levelly, shrugged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "Only a miracle will bring us there</seg><seg type="columnLine">so speedily." And he went the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their column, shouting that the pace be</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk watched, somewhat cheered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">willingness of these N'glanas. He had an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipated trouble from them -- that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not march with him into the dangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Guntali country. Yet they had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">willingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is, all of them save Gawai, La -</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeto's young warrior son, and those six</seg><seg type="columnLine">other young N'glanas who were his close</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting companions. They were visibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried, plainly keyed up over the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had been ordered out to do battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">against an enemy no one could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk blamed it upon their youth. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was wondering if it was his promise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic greater than that of Bwalla that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the older men willing. His magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of a few boxes of rockets and fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">works which he had brought up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coast once and had never used. Fireworks</seg><seg type="columnLine">always struck terror into the hearts of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had never before seen them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This magic was likely to be of no avail</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they reached the Guntali kraal during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon. The peril of a daylight res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cue was great.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, they passed through the foul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenched swamp and across the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau where Nyua's grave was located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S--Jungle Stories--Spring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHARRED CORPSES	65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And the grave, once again, was as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been that time Kirk looked upon it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyua had been called forth to prey upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the N'glanas. The heavy stones of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave were strewn about, and a yawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole gaped in the clay where the ancestor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">god's bones ordinarily rested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gawai cried out in horror and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">running along the trail to get free of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful place. His six companions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the older N'glanas, were filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal terror and hastened their pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a disordered, frantic flight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the party swiftly into the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness beyond the swamp. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'glanas caught a grip on their fears then</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slowed down to a walk. It relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk, too, that they were so quickly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that swamp. The odors of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed clean beside that ghastly smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all at once everyone realized that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stench had followed them. Out of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">air about them, like some formless vapor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the miasma of Nyua rose up again--faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first, but increasing in foul intensity as</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments passed. It gave re-birth to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear-frenzies of the N'glanas. Lakeeto and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few of the other braver men gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons ready in their hands as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes searched the bush about them for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy they could not see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice of Gawai was a thin wail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are doomed!" he cried. "Nyua is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuing us! Death will strike us before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get near the Guntali kraal!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN, almost miraculously, the stench</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwindled away, and only the more en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">durable odors of the jungle remained. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so incredible that the entire company</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nyua passed by and did not see us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Bori observed solemnly. "It is our</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was not luck," quickly spoke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk. "I carry on my person a juju that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is stronger than Nyua. Nyua is afraid--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as Bwalla and the Guntalis will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid when we meet them. My juju is all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see the sharp effect of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words upon the N'glanas, the strange way</seg><seg type="columnLine">they looked upon him in that instant. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift thinking he had saved his party from</seg><seg type="columnLine">66	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mutiny. Awe, momentarily, seemed to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place of terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The party resumed their journey once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. As they went on their silent way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lethargic dreeing of the insects, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, child-like chatter of monkeys in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treetops was an anodyne to their over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no peace, however, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind of Marty Kirk. Behind his impassive</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was concern and wonder. The stench,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising up from nowhere in the trail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanishing again, didn't seem a natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to fight back the mad feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing growing within him that the dead ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually could be called up from the grave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worse, some inner voice kept whispering</seg><seg type="columnLine">that new nerve-shaking terrors were wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them farther along the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But it seemed that he was wrong. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made good time the remainder of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was no trace of Nyua, nor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of death. It raised the spirits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks, even of Gawai and his youthful</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions, and none spoke of fear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger any longer, but of the good speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had made that day. It was as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they felt secure under the protection of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious, powerful juju their white</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader had spoken about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kirk made camp a short distance off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. It was a donga hemmed with baobab</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ironwood trees and flowering shrubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would screen their cooking fire from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes of any possible prowling bands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guntalis--a carefully chosen camping spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway between the trail and the old Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agoona water hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As a repast of posho and strips of wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">pig was started, Gawai, perhaps to atone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his display of cowardice, picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goatskin and offered to go for water. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his departure, the tired men sat in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle about the fire, discoursing little be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween each other. A prowling lion</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughed its challenge deep in the bush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was answered ,by the wild cry of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hyena. None of the jnen seemed to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. They seemed content to sit and rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After a while, Lakeeto stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is keeping Gawai, Bwana?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to Kirk. "It is not natural that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-son would tarry like this in a danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous bush."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kirk started up. He realized Gawai had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been gone the better part of a half hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a mission that should have taken no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than five minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wah, he has been gone too long," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bwana, it might be best if we went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water hole and joined him," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bori. A queer expression lay on his fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted ebon face. "He might have stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled in the darkness and hurt himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Kirk, Lakeeto, and Bori left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireside and filed through the jungle to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the Maragoona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did not find Gawai anywhere along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail to the water hole. They found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the water hole itself, and the youth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful hunter-warrior was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KIRK shuddered when they saw by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starlight how horribly Gawai had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died. His body was a charred mass. Gawai</seg><seg type="columnLine">had literally been consumed by fire--yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a fire that did not even scorch the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he lay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nyua!" whispered Bori in awe. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been following us and has fallen upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor Gawai to consume him with his dev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilish spirit-fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk did not reply, because Lakeeto</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, in a thickly muttered tone then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked and terrible to hear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My son---my man-child!" And Lakeeto</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent down and picked the charred body up</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderly in his arms. He turned and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking back to the camp with his grisly</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Kirk nor Bori said a word. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the filled goatskin of water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed Lakeeto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every man in the camp rose in horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they saw what Lakeeto carried into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the fire. Gone was their sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">security, and in its place was wailing terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fear. They milled about Kirk, beseech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that they turn back before all met</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deaths by this mysterious, all-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suming fire of Nyua.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been wrong!" they cried at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Your juju is not as powerful as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyua, for this cruel Guntali god has struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">at us once again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My juju is still all-powerful," Kirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">told them. "It protects me and those about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. It did not protect Gawai when he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth alone into the bush."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is true," spoke Lakeeto. "Now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE JUNGLE OF CHARRED CORPSES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will go forth to bury my dead, and I will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">return again because the dead do not dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turb the dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a strangely magnificent figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stepped fearlessly into the peril of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the haunted bush, and no man tried to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. And after the hunter was gone, Kirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that the remaining N'glanas had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol of their frantic fear. The logic of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument, backed by Lakeeto, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some effect. But they were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed, but watchful of the jungle about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lakeeto returned later without his son</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and sat apart, heavy with grief, as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">others ate of the meal. At last every man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lay down beside the fire to get some rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was much stirring in the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours following, for sleep under the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances was not easy. Kirk heard all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. Sleep was a stranger to him, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind was so alive with disturbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts--of Jane in the cruel grip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guntalis, and of this spine-chilling mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the corpse of a cruel jungle god rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to do such evil work. At last, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did sleep--much more soundly than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awakened suddenly, his head tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured by a sharp headache. Dawn grayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle. And he coughed, choking on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foul, acrid odor that made him forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pain of his head. He chilled to the aw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful realization that the stench of Nyua was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick upon the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Angrily, a little frightened at the weird</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon, he sat up and threw some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tindery branches upon the red embers of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fire. Some of the N'glanas wakened as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he did. They cried out at the ghastly smell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of death. And the entire camp stirred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That is, all except those six young com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panions of Gawai's. And the rising flames</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the kindled fire revealed why they did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not rise. They were dead--charred, hor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ribly burned corpses. Each had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burned to death while lying side by side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with Kirk and the remaining N'glanas!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KIRK stared in incredulous horror. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that moment he had striven to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince himself that all that had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been Guntali trickery. But the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talis could not enter a sleeping camp, burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing six men to death while the others slept.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It hinted of what Kirk did not and could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe--that the terrible Nyua was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an actuality!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The N'glanas were in a frenzy of terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he could not control. They milled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about the donga in the wild fear that at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any instant Nyua would return to also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slay them with this mysterious spirit-fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was only through the efforts of Chief</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bori that the men were gotten under con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trol. Bori then turned to Kirk and said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Your juju--like all jujus we have tried--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is powerless against Nyua. We cannot go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on. We do not care to die in this horrible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way as have our companions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kirk's eyes turned grim, burning, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said nothing to Bori and gestured La-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeto up to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">- "Lakeeto," he said. "Go to Bwana Grimm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at my mine and tell him to march upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Guntali kraal and join us at the cross-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trail beside the river. There is yet a way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we can defeat cursed Nyua, for I still have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It will be done," nodded Lakeeto. With</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the spontaneity natural to him, he picked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up his weapons and plunged into the jun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gle, setting off for the mine, w'hich was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not too far distant from that place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remaining men stood in a sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Pick up your burdens," Kirk said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "We are proceeding toward the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tali kraal. We will meet Bwana Grimm</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. As I told Lakeeto, I have another</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Chief Bori moved nearer Kirk. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendliness was gone from him. A stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born sneer was on his black face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plans and numbers mean nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Nyua," he said. "We are not fools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We know that death is waiting in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle for all of us. There is nothing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to do but get out of Tembu-Loma as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as we are able."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kirk's features w'ere rock-hard, unread-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able. He had no new plan of action. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fact, he was as shaken by these queer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">events as they. Yet Jane, he was sure, was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being held at the Guntali kraal as a sacri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fice victim. While he still could lift a hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against man or ghoul, he would do his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">utmost to save her from a ghastly fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You and your men, Bori, are under my</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders," he said harshly. "Obey me, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else you will be punished."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No orders can detain us," Bori retorted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">68	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We mean to turn back and get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this accursed place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fury inflamed Kirk, also desperation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Jane's life was in peril. He whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the heavy pistol that he carried on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are obeying my commands!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "If any of you dare--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The N'glanas surged at him in a brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass. The pistol was knocked from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp. Cursing, fighting, he strove to battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">against these frenzied black men--until a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle stock caught him a hard glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow on the forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He fell senseless beside the campfire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KIRK felt as though he were struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a tunnel of velvet darkness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no ending. But at last he became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dreeing of the jungle insects, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of chattering monkeys scolding one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, and the muted cathedral choir of</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden-throated birds. Dazedly he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to his knees and looked about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation-hemmed donga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not know how much time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, but the day was fully light now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he saw that he was alone in the camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with only the gruesome charred remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dead men beside him. Even his guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and equipment had been taken away by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserting N'glanas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The full impact of his frightening pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicament--that a ruthless, peril-filled jun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle still lay before him, and he was with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out food or weapons--shook his numbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching brain. And if he did not reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guntali village before dark fell that eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, Jane would die by torture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment, he cursed the N'glanas</seg><seg type="columnLine">--yet he could imagine the depths of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that had brought them to leave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this place to die so that they might pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve their own lives. But it bothered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Chief Bori--so intelligent, despite his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inborn savagery, with reasoning equal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men--should Iso cruely turn against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, too. He had always felt Bori would</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain loyal to him in any circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as he knew Lakeeto would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lakeeto! Recollection of the faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter and the mission he had gone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised Kirk's dwindled hope. Joe Grimm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his men, might even at this moment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be marching toward the Guntali kraal. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he met them . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It left him a fighting chance to rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane, and his eagerness to get on sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering out of the donga toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. Much of his grogginess was gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he reached the trail, and he trekked</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead at a trot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dogged desperation goaded him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he pressed on he watched for signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the evil curse of Nyua to strike at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some devilish way or another. Oddly, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of new trouble confronted him. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as though the cruel jungle god had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned from him to follow the N'glanas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was still pondering over the startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact some hours past noon as he trekked</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer and nearer to Bwalla's stronghold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Until all at once he heard the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanting voices in the trail before him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the chant--the hunting song of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Guntalis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flung himself wildly into the bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the trail and hunched there. Breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, he watched a party of six Guntali</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors file past:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It told him he was perilously close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their village now. He would have to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, for capture would defeat any op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity of saving Jane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, with infinite caution, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the damp, ferny under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth and re-entered the trail. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering about Grimm--if the mine man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager had gotten into the vicinity yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then there was a crashing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undergrowth beside the trail near him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked, spun wildly around. But it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guntali warrior that came lunging out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fronds. It was Lakeeto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk gasped when he saw him. Lakeeto</seg><seg type="columnLine">was staggering and spent. His broad, heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chest was a mass of crimson, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects covered the blood like a grayish mat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lakeeto!" Kirk blurted, and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of the black hunter to steady him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lakeeto, what . . .?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lakeeto's sweat-dripping body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling. The black man had to struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak. And when he found his voice, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no more than a gasping, painful whis-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">per.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bwana! I have learned -- the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nyua is nothing. Your dearest companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a murderer--a betrayer--" His voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke off, his knees sagging beneath his</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE JUNGLE OF CHARRED CORPSES	69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. He fell to the ground and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lakeeto !" cried Kirk, stooping down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. And then he saw. The faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hunter was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he saw more. The wound in La-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeto's breast was that of a rifle bullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KIRK straightened up, his brown face</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleak. It meant that Lakeeto had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been slain by a Guntali. Nor was it credi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble that one of the N'glanas had shot him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk was convinced that the bullet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from a white man's gun--the si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenced gun of the same vicious white mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer who had been slaying the Guntali</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters for some personal reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Lakeeto had said the murderer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk's dearest companion, a betrayer. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Kirk could reason this out, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six Guntali hunters leaped from the bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all sides of him. They were greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">angered and fell upon him without mercy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was bound with strips of tonga bark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dazed and bruised was dragged up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail in the direction of their village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being taken at last to their circular vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage, the people of Guntali milled round</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he was dragged to the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, grotesque idol of Nyua which stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of their compound. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeered and spit on him, until, all at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their naked ranks opened up a path for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall, stalwart black man who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">striding up among them. It was Bwalla,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Guntalis stood motionless, silent, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bwalla stepped alongside of Kirk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared down at him. Bitterness and hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in the king's steady gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am a just man, Bwana," he said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not forgotten the good you and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden-haired wife have more than once</seg><seg type="columnLine">done for my people. Therefore, when an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of my hunters fell before the noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less flaming spear of your ghost-demon, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not call forth Nyua as I threatened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor did I when a second hunter fell. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">today, when a third of my hunters was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain by your ghost-demon, my patience</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I instructed my hunters to search the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush and find a person of white skin so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we might have a victim for the Cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony of Fire which will bring Nyua out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of his holy grave. The victim they cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured is you--and that is good, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are the leader of all white men in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. It will be through your death that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all whites will suffer and die by the wrath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nyua for the wrongs they have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">unto our tribe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk stared up at Bwalla, his mind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirlpool of wild thinking.

Jane, plain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, had not been captured by the Guntalis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taken here, because then the hunters</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have been sent out to search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a victim. And Lakeeto, going to enlist</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Grimm's aid, had been shot to death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but dying had managed to reach Kirk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, "I have learned the truth.

I have seen men die of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire that does not bum the grass at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. It is not Nyua's work, however, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Bwalla has not called your great god</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth. It is the work of an evil white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who means that I should die and that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be blamed for it. He cares nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the lives he takes.

There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewilderment in Bwalla's level gaze, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the gray cloud of bitterness and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusionment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think you that we are fools, Bwana?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.

One drop of it is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly as an ember fanned to white heat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk lay stiffly, staring.

And all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in the village caught sight of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. A great roar rose up from them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they surged at him from every side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept on like a plunging bullet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing short of a spear or arrow might</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop.

And while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled this direction and that, he felt sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all his efforts would come to nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too great odds were against him to facili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate a complete escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet after the passage of two hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he paused in a fern-bed, his sodden</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing rent and tattered from the thorny</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths of the forest, he realized that fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">had played on his side. The sound of pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, the maddening thump of signal drums,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone, and all he heard was the end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less chorus of the jungle insects in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. Somewhere off to his left, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion roared its challenge as it stalked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush for prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ignored the danger of the prowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion, for hope was reborn within him by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this incredible escape from burning death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he saw the one task before him.

Tired and worn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as he was, he set off toward the not-</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-distant tin mine at a trot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jungle along this way was not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly grown and he was able to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good time.

Even Bobolongonga who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traded his adjustable wrench for the lance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his ancestors, and his white man's pants</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a skirt of pink-dyed raffia, could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lured from the circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Neil soon had enough of arguing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remounted the lofty seat of the Caterpillar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let out the clutch, and advanced under full</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttle. With a mighty roar of exhaust</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monster rolled across the ceremonial</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire sending dancers fleeing into the.</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps. It demolished tom-toms and gri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gris, and drove on directly for the holy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">holies, the mud hut of Sabata.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The natives watched, confidently expect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing O'Neil and caterpillar both to dissolve</seg><seg type="columnLine">in blue flame, but no such thing took place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cat mounted the sloping wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut for a meter or so, and then the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sabata collapsed in a heap of mud, sticks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and straw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus lay shattered not only the mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut, but also much of the power of Ikete.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donomey, who long had resented the„witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor's power, ordered his men back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cutting grounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT Ikete was not yet licked. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated to his old hut in the village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted to the fetish throughout an after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon and a night, and appeared with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">untouchable robe of bat's fur around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and an ancient calibash turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his head. Thus equipped, he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced praying O'Neil to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nijji-fe-bowa," chanted Ikete, "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse of Sabata upon him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Work stopped again. Even subjects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Nganda spent their days near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetish hut awaiting the result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was soon noticed that O'Neil had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from sight. A houseboy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bondele brought word that he had sickened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay all day in his hammock. Ikete</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted with new enthusiasm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donomey, repenting his haste, issued a</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless order against working at the cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting grounds. Rumors were many. O'Neil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown skin had turned green. His flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">94	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had run away leaving him only skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched over skeleton, and his hook arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sprouted a branch of poison ninga,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves, berries and all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Actually, O'Neil had chosen this poorest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all times to go down for his yearly bout</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fever. After five days he got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ministered to himself with whiskey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was then Tommy told him about Ikete's</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinations,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Neil did not know it at the time, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even his arising had strengthened the belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Ikete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is thus--according to the Sabata fet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish, the man being prayed to death will at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sleep and waste away. Then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper moment arrives, the anointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sabata takes the calibash from his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and has brought to him a cockerel. Utter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing certain words, he breaks one and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other of the cockerel's legs, after which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he holds the poor bird overhead. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time it is thus with the witch doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at the cockerel's bill, and speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fetish language. At last a drop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood appears at the cockerel's bill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls, striking the witch doctor's tongue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When that drop of blood falls, the victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">must arise, be he fifty kilometers away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasten to the fetish hut where he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance until he expires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so the links of circumstances which</seg><seg type="columnLine">began with O'Neil's recurrence of the fever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now continued as he strode along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle trail toward the village. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, message drums gave out their rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, speechlike rhythm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A CRY went up from four hundred na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive throats when he appeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village clearing. A lane opened for him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he strode up to the ceremonial fire where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ikete, untrembling and triumphant, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding aloft the dripping bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ikete signaled with his lips, and the tom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms throbbed the slow rhythm of the dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death. But it was there the links of cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstance failed. O'Neil did not dance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode on, booting tom-toms from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, seized the cockerel from Ikete's hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commenced beating him over the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a squawk or two the poor bird ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pired. O'Neil beat Ikete with the carcass</seg><seg type="columnLine">until feathers flew. Ikete took it for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, then he fled across the clearing and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">along a jungle path with O'Neil in pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next day Donomey ordered a full crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cutting grounds, and a young witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor was at the village gathering sticks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build a hut to Willilahau, the river fetish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, he asserted, hastened the fermenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of millet and the fruitfulness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harvest, and was, morever, very powerful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having a hook arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ikete, although defeated, still had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venge. His machinations had caused such</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay it was apparent they could get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sufficient quantity of correctly grained</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood before the roads bogged down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one morning Donomey came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp followed by two of his tribesmen who</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a huge crotch of mahogany. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waterlogged from the swamp, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapwood was rotting away, but the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twisted grain was hard, and streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep brown and black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Considerable of the black mahogany, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in deadfalls, had been revealed by the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding waters of the dry season. O'Neil</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the sulphuric and copperas waters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swamp had turned it that color, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a moral victory for the opinion he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expressed back in Coquilhatville. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood was worth good money, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not take him long to get crews on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to pull the logs and peel the rotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapwood. Through the following weeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as rains commenced and grew worse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening to mire the Catetrpillar, O'Neil</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed the transport to Bondele . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Neil was so tired one night that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided he would sleep in a hammock at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp. He stretched out and had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed his eyes when the sound of excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices aroused him. A boy had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the nightly dance and was repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting the name "Donomey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Neil tried to 'learn what was wrong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but nobody seemed sure. He joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torchlit group which followed the boy along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little-used jungle path. After four</seg><seg type="columnLine">or five kilometers travel the uplifted torches</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed Donomey lying beside a nest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulldog ants. O'Neil pushed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle and felt for the old man's pulse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donomey was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not death, but the manner of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">which shocked O'Neil. The native boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cut him down, but it was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat chieftan had been strung up by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbs, smeared with honey, and allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLACK MAHOGANY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to dangle so his toes would just touch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-foot high anthill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So this was the penalty for Donomey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooperation! A feeling of white anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned through O'Neil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An ancient native with gray wool hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced on spindly legs and chanted.

Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the company manager's squat, white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin-roofed office he could see the monthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail boat tied up at the wharf,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden wave of nostalgia swept him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In ten days he could be in Brazza-ville.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In ten more he could be in Angola. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">another two weeks, if he was lucky, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be back in New York.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slow-moving stolid man, Maastrict sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in his chair and dry-washed his fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms together.

"You don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. But I know you, by reputation. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly before you arrived, Mr. Maastrict</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed me that you are the only man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Belgian Congo, perhaps in all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa who can help me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter stood fingering the butt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun.

"And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to outfit a safari to bring him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can name your own price to lead it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Maastrict informs me that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only white man whom the natives will</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow into the valley."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter shook his head. "What you ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">is impossible. That whole back country</seg><seg type="columnLine">has gone mad.

"It would seem that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, whoever is behind this, didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to come out." He poked at the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun darts with a pencil. '"That one is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned kalclii thorn.

Since then it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hell on earth. A dozen kraals have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been looted and burned to the ground, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, women, and children slaughtered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other whole kraals have disappeared.

Carter stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door and stared out into the blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was difficult to recognize the two gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque figures staggering across the pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rade ground as men. Their heads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">matted with clotted blood. Great swarms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of kuuna flies covered their faces like veils.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red welts circled their bodies. The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin hung from their thighs and legs in</seg><seg type="columnLine">RED ROGUE KILLER	103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flaps. As Carter watched one of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed. The other man staggered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.

"Who did</seg><seg type="columnLine">this?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sheitani, the devil!" the Masai gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sank down in the shade of the building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sunken eyes beginning to glaze.

They - were Swahili, Masai,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kavirondo, Kikuyu, Wakambas, Morani,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bakussu, and many more whom he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize. All were led by a red-bearded</seg><seg type="columnLine">black god who bellowed like a bull that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but the chosen of the gods must go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place of dying. He says that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept captive many days in a big cave in</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Valley of the Lost Ones.

I don't know w7hat to say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter settled his gun belt on his hips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's not a matter of saying. It's a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doing something. This man was tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured to death by some foul, inhuman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiend. And I'm heading back up bush in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen Sutliff gripped his arm. "I'm go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with you." Her next words chilled his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. "Can't you understand? I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know. Barney has red hair!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter looked at his own sun-blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. A good many tribes were light. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as color was concerned, he, himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily pass as black. "Well, I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned. You don't believe . . . ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," the girl sobbed. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it's Barney, he's out of his mind. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to know. I have to. And I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with you in the morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Life, Carter thought, was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems. But some of them were unfair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He studied the simple faces of the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">now led by a white-robed jelanti as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">talkee godoo swelled in volume. A white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man falling from the sky might possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">establish himselef as a god in the minds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back bush natives. Still, planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">common. They flew overhead every day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the man in back of this was sane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a profit motive somewhere. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad man could have linked together tribes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who hated each other to the death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a reason for the burned kraals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the missing villagers. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing foul, and deep, and dark here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">only full exposure to the light would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see," he told the girl. "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind w^as made up. Whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-bearded black god was Sutliff, whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sutliff was mad or not, the girl would</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain at the station. The back country</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding The Valley of the Lost Ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no place for a woman. The lush green</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley was Africa rawr and untamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">primeval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY had left the station behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark of the hour before sun-up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later wrould come the wilderness of thorns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tall veldt- grass that cut like a knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still later would come the river. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle rose in a green-roofed cathedral</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the heads of the safari. His hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the butt of his gun, Nylabo padding at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels, Carter led the file of burden-laden</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearers and the scant platoon of poorly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed soldiers that Maastrict had begrudg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly given him. He had claimed that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed the others for the protection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daybreak was a misty glow that filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the green, that colored the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">104	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gray beards of fungus hanging down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees. A bushbuck crossed the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A little farther on, a forest hog eyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men suspiciously and merged again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green. But for the drip of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">dew the silence was complete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the hour that Carter liked best</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun w'as high in the trees when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nylabo sniffed the air suspiciously. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a stale mousey smell that told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a colony of monkeys had traveled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail before them, perhaps even now were</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched, gray blossoms of fur, high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees above them eyeing the intruders. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was also another smell, the unwashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">stench of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bwana, I like this not," he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter had paused as he had spoke, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced back down the strung-out safari to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make certain that all was well. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger darkened his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you're furious. So what!" Ellen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sutliff stepped out from in back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive black who had masked her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wearing riding breeks and boots. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a heavy 6.5 Manlicher as if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how to use it. "I don't care what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you said last night. I'm going with you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	can take care of myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With an elephant gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're after big game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And deadly game," Carter said coldly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All that you have done is delay us. Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back to the station, Nylabo. And tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maastrict that I said ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off sharply, his hand whipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun from its holster as the jungle came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to life with a sudden smacking of lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry coughing. Alarmed, the colony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkeys swdshed by over their heads. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing to shoot at, nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Malignantly alive, the green wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle hemmed them in. Then a massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swahili bearer dropped his load and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped a palm to his chest. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it away again his eyes bulged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head in fear. Clutched between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers was a deadly kalchi dart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take cover!" Carter baw'led.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cursing, he forced the girl behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of a huge gray trunked baobab tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other bearers were dropping now. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">were calling on Gedeonsu to save them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Far back down the trail, the soldiers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing blindly into the green. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them broke and ran. A poisoned dart</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped him in his tracks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another dart "spitt" into the tree at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter's ear. It was followed by a sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped poisoned arrow that thudded into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaf mould between himself and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. He caught a flash of movement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves and fired. There was a crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling and crashing of branches and a hide- '</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously painted Bakussu fell almost at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet still clutching his deadly blow gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the last of his dying strength the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage raised his blow gun and Nylabo</seg><seg type="columnLine">nailed him to a root of the baobab with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful thrust of his assegai.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The attack ended as suddenly as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun. Half of the bearers and soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dead. The others were milling help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. Carter came to a swift decision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no way of knowing how many men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the attacking party. But through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel of the trees he could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open veldt. There lay comparative safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least they could not be ambushed. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back down the trail meant to die. Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay between them and the station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cursing, shouting, encouraging, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">herded the frightened bearers and soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the trail toward the open ground.

The attack on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safari failed to make sense. Why had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it begun? Why had it ended so abruptly?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought of the dart and the poisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow and smiled grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been shot at and missed too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times.

Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly rising night wind began to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds. There was a slithering ripple in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall veldt grass. A night bird screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. There was a deep-bellied roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lion that had missed his kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl studied the dubious shelter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thorn boma in which they were camped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shuddered slightly. This wasn't Cape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">town or Cairo, or even Nairobi with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">long rows of eucalyptus trees, and hotels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clubs, and Government buildings. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an Africa that she had never known,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a malignantly - alive green hell in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">life was held cheaply and the only law was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldest law of self-survival, kill or be</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why," she demanded of Carter, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red-bearded black god is Barney should</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men attack us? Why would he en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger my life?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes red rimmed with fatigue, Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter stared at her coldly across the fire. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know," he said shortly. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even know that the red-bearded black god</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Barney Sutliff. It still doesn't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense if he is." He got to his feet stiffly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do know that I wish that you had stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Katumbo as I told you to.

"And there is no chance of outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">help?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help from whom?"

That's why they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hire fools like me.

The very lush</seg><seg type="columnLine">richness of its veldts and mountains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungles made men greedy. And greedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were cruel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going outside to take a look-see."</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told Nylabo.

Sundown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the next day would bring them to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp on the N'gesi. From the camp on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the N'gesi there would still be ten days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard paddling before they reached Carter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost inaccessible upriver station in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist-covered hills near the Valley of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost Ones.	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He circled the boma thoughtfully, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to stand at the gate, Kaka and</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'dembi crouching behind him, the whites</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their eyes rolling wildly in the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Of death they were not afraid. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something a man could understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they were bang vir die spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whimpering ghosts of dead men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were known to haunt the campfires at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had warmed their bones for at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least the space of two moons after they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died. And many men had died that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter tried to marshal his thoughts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tired mind flew off at tangents. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, the work of ten years, his test</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes and his cultures, might all be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed by the time that he returned. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that he had accomplished in Katumbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might better never have made the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">H E pounded a clenched fist in his palm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But why? What was it all about?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why was he being saved? For what?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The kraal burnings and the thefts and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murders and the mysteriously vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">villagers failed to make sense. This wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">intertribal war. This was extermination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind returned to the profit motive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The price of ivory was down. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gold, lots of it in the Congo, and gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thirty-five dollars an ounce. More,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabulous prices were being paid for cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the military garrisons on both coasts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, too, there were the tribes them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. Despite all the edicts against it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thriving slave trade still flourished. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible as it seemed, in a world where</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were fighting and dying for the Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freedoms, there still were slave markets</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Africa and Arabia where a young slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">in full strength sold for a hundred thalers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The small veins in his temple began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat as he recalled Nylabo's translation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dying Masai's last w'ords ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Each day they were tortured that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-bearded black god might laugh.

The at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack had not been resumed but he knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole safari knew, that they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. The remaining porters and sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion soldiers were sullenly rebellious. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have left him if they had dared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They claimed, and rightly so, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not fight a death they could not see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But death lay between them and Katumbo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no way to go but onward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rippling in the grass grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced. Whatever it was it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">human. There was too much disturbance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was most likely, Carter thought, a bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant, strayed from the herd or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a nocturnal hippo enroute to a wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing hole in the stream on which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were camped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cursed himself for not having picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a rifle before he had left the boma.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't shoot!" he ordered Kaka and</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'dembi. I think that it's only a hippo</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his way to a water hole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke the wide spreading black</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss of horn of a shaggy gray bull buffalo</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted the grass, his little pig eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">red with murderous lust and his distended</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils dripping blood as he stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men and the boma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't shoot!" Carter repeated sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke too late. N'dembi's gun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already at his shoulder. This was a danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see. As the rifle cracked behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Carter groaned. Slate like fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shattered from the horn. The hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn covered the brains. There were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">three vulnerable spots, the nose, the shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, and the throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lower! In the nose!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More slate flew from the horn. Kaka's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, a huge-bored, old fashioned, .505</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gibbs was roaring now. He, too, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting high. Then the bull lowered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and charged at the three men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boma. Carter sidestepped swiftly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting a warning to Ellen and Nylabo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the charging bull passed him he emptied</seg><seg type="columnLine">his .45 into his neck in a futile effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'dembi screamed once and died, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrails spilling from his body as the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast impaled him and charged on to level</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thorn boma to the ground. Screaming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear and calling on Kromanti and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gedeonsu to save them, the soldiers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearers swarmed from the boma like ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran blindly into the veldt grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter had a quick glance of Ellen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nylabo as they stood beside the fire. Ny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">labo had just hurled his assegai and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomping out the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWENTY yards beyond the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boma had once stood, the pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maddened bull turned and stood pawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turf and regarding the golden haired'</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl standing slim and erect in the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run! Climb a tree," Carter shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's going to charge you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still clutching her heavy Manlicher, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl seemed rooted to the ground as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull charged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nylabo was fumbling in the moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a rifle dropped by one of the frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houssa. But the girl was between him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bull. Carter snatched the Gibbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Kaka's hands and raced across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen had sidestepped the bull as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gracefully as a matador performing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">veronica. But the pain-insane beast had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter thumbed the fresh shells into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun that Kaka had pressed into his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knelt between the bull and Ellen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aiming carefully as the buffalo's huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk began to move, he put five slugs into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast's muzzle. Everyone of the slugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck home The old-fashioned .505 Gibbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a muzzle velocity of two tons. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all his shots worried the bull Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been using bird shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bloody muzzle charged closer at</seg><seg type="columnLine">express train speed. The shaggy head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its great spread of horns dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down for the kill. He was only feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man now. Carter could read murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the blood-shot eyes--then a heavy gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked behind him. The huge beast stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had run into a stone wall. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy gray body shuddered, dropped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its knees and rolled over on its side pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning Carter's legs before he could scramble</seg><seg type="columnLine">free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nylabo pulled him out from underneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brute. "Death come very close." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spat in obvious admiration. "You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">truely big juju, bwana."</seg><seg type="columnLine">RED ROGUE KILLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You made the juju" Carter told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond girl soberly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She reloaded the Manlicher. "I've shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I was a child." She blinked rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep from crying. "Barney taught me</seg><seg type="columnLine">how."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At any rate, I was wrong about you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he admitted.

"Look, Lord Bwana"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed a tawny finger at the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast's muzzle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be damned!" Carter pushed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet back on his head, cupped a lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">match in his hands, and squatted beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bull. Three of the five slugs he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired were visible in the muzzle, scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">embedded in the flesh. Carter demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh shell from Kaka and pried out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead with his knife. It was small wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slugs had failed to stop the bull.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where did you get these shells?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The frightened Houssa . told him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Catc'num Bwana Ismail.

For some reason of his own the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snag-toothed Arab had sent the escort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porters out to die with scarcely enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder in their shells to propel the lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their gun barrels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared back down the trail through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark. He had a score to settle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ismail. But that could wait. Right now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had business with a red-bearded killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">who called himself a black god.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FORMS grew in the moonlight around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him as one by one the bearers and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station soldiers, bang vir die spoke, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened by the creeping night things in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall veldt grass, straggled back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined camp, seeking safety in numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in Bzvana Juju's known magical</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Nylabo counted noses four of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters and two of the Houssa had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.

But if you'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nylabo turn the safari around ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Carter put his fingers over his lips. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a girl of whom a man could well be</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud. For the first time he was glad she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there. "We're going on," he told her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And we're going on together until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get at the bottom of this red-bearded black</seg><seg type="columnLine">god business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She clung to him a moment, her firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">young body close to his. Life was short.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death was near. And now that the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died the hot black African night</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed in on them like a shroud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE distant mist-tipped hills and roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing green slopes were not so distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. The veldt grass had growm even</seg><seg type="columnLine">taller but the trail was well defined. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other half hour's trek would bring them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the river. The terror of the night, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling, creeping, unseen things had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. It showed in the firm-stride of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porters and the laughter of the alert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houssa as they brought up the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short half hour away were the savory</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking pots of the great, sprawling Kavi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riondo village in which Bwana Juju had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">left his up-river boys. There would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasting, and boasting, and songs. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">might even be a Ngoma to celebrate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack that they had fought off in the jun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle. From time to time a boy broke into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few dance steps, slapping his palm against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle stock as though it was a drum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matching her pace to Carter's, Ellen</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "They're just children."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter glanced back along the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"With men's responsibilities. They may</seg><seg type="columnLine">think and act like children but they fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and die like men." He had not mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message shot into the thorn tree since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before. "What sort of a man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your brother?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen's eyes clouded slightly. "He's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">better and no worse than any other. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is adventurous. He's had some trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the law." She blinked back tears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I won't believe, I can't believe, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is the red-bearded black god!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back in Katumbo you thought he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have to know," she said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The chances are he's dead," Carter told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few hundred yards farther on a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend in the river they were nearing formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a water hole. A cloud of scarlet and black</seg><seg type="columnLine">finks rose from the reeds. Blue and orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingfishers filled the air. Black-faced mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keys chattered angrily and climbed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees. A white hippo waded out deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water and lay with only its nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trils and eyes eexposed. The wildebeeste</seg><seg type="columnLine">and young zebra took alarm with a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound of hoofbeats. Carter shot two wilde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beeste. Nylabo ran down another and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">its throat. The fresh meat would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome addition to the feasting and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing the boys anticipated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the safari was underway again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ellen spoke the question that had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind since she had met Carter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Katumbo. Lean-faced, burned to the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of saddle leather by the sun, quiet, cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, Steve Carter was different than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man whom she had known. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded her slightly of the statue of Cecil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rhodes that she had seen in Pretoria.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing in Africa?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What am I doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter packed his pipe and lit it.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't sense enough to leave. I came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a traveling doctor for a Belgian syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicate and stayed to take over a district.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I've been happy here. Africa is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical paradise. It has every disease</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to mandkind and a few that haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been named." His eyes began to glow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's the richest, most productive, conti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent on earth but disease and ignorance</seg><seg type="columnLine">have held it back for centuries. Tens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of acres capable of supporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of men and women support only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a handful of natives because of the tsetse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black-water fever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen laughed lightly. "I see. You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">altruistic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter shook his head. "That's a ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar word and I'm only a two thaler</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. Not that I ever collect," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted. "1 draw a salary for getting out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gold and ivory. The doctoring is</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown in free. That's why the natives call</seg><seg type="columnLine">me Bzvana JuJu."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode on ahead to have a few words</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Nylabo. He found the Zulu studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men have passed this way within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, bwana," Nylabo told him.

"All were black but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. That one wore boots with heels."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed to a spoor too faint for Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see. "Maybe better safari stop and Ny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">labo go ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter considered. Despite their light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of heart, the porters and the Houssa</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dog tired. They had trekked almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-six hours with only a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. They were looking forward to reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the village. "How many men?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. "The same gang that jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">us outside of Katumbo?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nylabo shook his head. "That, no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell, bwana." He studied the spoor</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. "But it was seven men who passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were traveling with great speed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CARTER checked the safari mentally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He still had ten Houssa and fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters. All of the porters were armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the guns of the men who had died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were only a few minutes' trek from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large village. It was all clear country</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here in.

"Killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't a doctor's business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Africa," he told her, "a doctor is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">just another man. He does what he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Killing isn't a doctor's business.

He doubted that it was Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sutliff. The famous soldier of fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">was undoubtedly dead. No man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash a plane in the Valley of the Lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones and walk out of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Who was the man?

What in the name of Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">could a man who proclaimed himself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-bearded black god want of a back bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor? Where did Ismail come in? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he passed out half filled shells? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it possible that the loot from the burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages w7as passing through Katumbo?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was that why Maastrict had suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a month or so in Brazza-ville would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do him good? That was difficult to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve. Still, trade had come almost to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">standstill. The company was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">marking days off on the calender and hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on until normal times. And the lush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich, virginity of Africa made men greedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He froze in his tracks at the shot. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole safari froze, the porters and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houssa black marble statues glistening with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat and carved from the rock of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shot was followed by a second, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third.

A dead village sentry lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, his limp body swarming with mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous big Siafu ants and his throat a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson gash from ear to ear. Carter felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh. It still was warm. The man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dead only a matter of minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the trail, and across the river, a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine gun began to stutter. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill screaming of women and children.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An oily smoke rose through the belt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees that screened the stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen looked at the body and turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter told off Kaka to stay with her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The rest of you come on.

Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge Bakussu warriors painted in alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate stripes of red and white had rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the slippery mud bank into the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet them. One of them raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and a hurled assegai grazed Carter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek.

The pupils of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bakussu's eyes were contracted to pin</seg><seg type="columnLine">points, the eyes themselves were blank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slately.

He continued grimly, "Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">safaried in here this morning on my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Katumbo and ran into this bloody hell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hadn't been here an hour before those</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody devils jumped us.

Now, in places, the pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dlers had to bend their backs double against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frothing water that sought to sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big canoe down stream or dash it</seg><seg type="columnLine">against one of the sharp edged rocks that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from the river bed as if to bar the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way into the Valley of the Lost Ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the leafy branches of huge trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">met overhead to form an eerie green tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel.

"It's like moving through some</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehistoric world that mankind has not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His uniform shirt black with sweat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Dennis feathered his paddle. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">much farther?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll reach the station by night," Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was worried. He had been worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">for days. His eyes tried again and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pierce the green wall that hemmed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. He had a feeling that they were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched. It had persisted for days. Nights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had insisted that they camp on sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">spits in the middle of the river. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to wonder if they had been wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">in pushing on to the up-river station. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might perhaps have been better to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck south toward Kabola or Kanda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kanda. Still, he owed a duty - to his na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives. They trusted in, depended on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they rounded a bend in the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">they caught their first sight of man since</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the burned Kikuyu village. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">upped the beat of the paddles but before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could reach him he had stepped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the green wall. Later, signal drums</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to pound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dennis mopped sweat from his florid</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "What name people this place?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Nylabo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Akesi," the Zulu grunted.

"Give them an inch and they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut your throat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen moved closer to Carter. Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wide with wonder. "Those drums--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shook his head. "They're nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry about. Those aren't war drums."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He chuckled. "That's only jungle West-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern Union.

The women working</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fields looked up shyly. The warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarding them raised their assegais in</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting and shouted, "Jambo, Bwana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juju."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fear left Ellen's eyes.

"What did you do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them like you so? Go native?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nylabo looked up sharply, his tawny</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes slitted with hate. He did not like this</seg><seg type="columnLine">British bwana. Both his words and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists wrere hard. Several times he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck at him and cursed him for no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason he could see but that his skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Carter shrugged.

What all blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">need is a taste of the whip, and often."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He scowled at Nylabo's back. "That boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yours for example.

Nylabo laid down his paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reached for his short hafted assegai.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Houssa whooped with excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop it," Carter ordered sharply. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to your paddling, Nylabo. And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit riding Nylabo, Captain Dennis. We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">all overstrained.

We aren't ourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm myself," Dennis said coldly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he resumed his paddling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was difficult for Carter to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man. He had grown more arrogant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overbearing with each rising sun.

He hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would not have trouble with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he was afraid that he would. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen other men, too small for Africa, go</seg><seg type="columnLine">cafard. Here there were no half way</seg><seg type="columnLine">measures. Africa either made a man, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">RED ROGUE KILLER	117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LATE that afternoon they put in at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akesi village only a few miles below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station. Carter was relieved to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">it standing. The villagers were glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him. Cooking fires were lighted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gourds of palm toddy were proffered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swarms of naked children followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the street. "Jambo, Bwana Juju" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed from all sides. Comely, full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasted, Akesian girls, wearing bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored prints and calicoes wound about</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies, joked and laughed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houssa and openly admired Ellen's hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're pretty," she said, smiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They could be Arab women."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He explained that they were on the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave trail, that for years the Akesi witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctors had purchased their vestal virgins</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the slavers. As a result the tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mixture of Arab, Wahuma, Ora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">savo, and half-caste Arabeezi blood. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red-bearded black god has left this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe alone, I'll never know.

After an hour's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard bargaining, and by payment of most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trade goods he had salvaged, he ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged for two dozen warriors to accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany him to the station and on into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley of the Lost Ones when he had or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganized his safari.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he rose to return to the river, Ny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">labo touched his arm and told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Pembi wished to see him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aged witch doctor's hut was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far edge of the village, set apart from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.

With a gigantic ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort of will M'Pembi had plucked the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his forehead and held it up for all to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see.

The canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept around a bend in the river and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter trudged wearily back to the land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, his mind confused. Ismail's presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">this high on the river could mean much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It could mean that Sutliff had finished with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his raids, that he had made his pile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting out while the getting was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. He doubted that Sutliff, mad or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane, would harm his sister. But he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would happeen to Dennis. The Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishman, turned over to the drug inflamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">renegades of many tribes, would be tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured until he died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared glumly at the ground. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could do was organize a safari and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. Ellen's face rose before him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">winced. She had been so certain that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother was not the black god. He prayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she would be safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the short twelve days that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known her he had grown more fond of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ellen than he had realized. She was a fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate for a jungle man. She, too, loved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, even if she feared it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nylabo, his tawny skin glistening with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat, broke into his brief meditation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lord, Bwana--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bwana Dennis struggled fiercely? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot many times with his gun until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty?

Many times." Carter looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Zulu, puzzled. "You saw it.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen eyes swept the landing and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">churned up mud. "When men fight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, they bleed. And nowhere can Ny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">labo see blood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter's eyes followed Nylabo's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no blood on the landing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no blood in the mud. The pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended struggle had been faked. Dennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been one-of the gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was why he had returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was why M'Pembi had been killed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Dennis had been the man to whom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been about to name. And whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the florid faced man was, he wasn't Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis of the King's African Rifles. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an impostor, a fake. He was traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with either forged or stolen papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DAWN of the following day tinted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills with crimson. Nylabo, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched all night, found the spoor where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attacking party had left the river. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were thirty men in the party, traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. The small imprint of Ellen's heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plain in the soft mud of the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited for the rest of the safari to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join him, then followed the spoor to a trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wound down through the hills into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist shrouded valley. It was a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide-out. Except for the black god's own</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, their senses dulled by drugs, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akesi, themselves dabblers in black magic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were, perhaps, in all the Congo no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other tribes who would dare to enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remaining Kikuyu porters deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a body as Carter made his preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">to descend. Despite the fact that the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing air was biting cold this high, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houssa clutched their rifles with sweating</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands as they stared at the sea of vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">below them. It was useless for Carter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain that the gray vapors, opalescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rising sun, were not the shades of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead men but steam rising from small vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canic springs in the bottom of the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kaka made their decision for them. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow, Bwana Juju," he told Carter, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrestle with Sheitani, the devil, for the-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul of the gold haired memsahib" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed piously toward Mecca. "But may</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allah have mercy on our souls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Akesi, skeleton-limbed, thin-faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">human bundles of steel wire, said nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They knew this valley well. Before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming of the black god the Leopard men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had used it often for certain unspeakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rituals of their owrn. More, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Pembi to avenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter and Nylabo leading, the safari</seg><seg type="columnLine">began a slow descent, wary of posted sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries. How many men the black god had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter had no way of knowing. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that he had lost better than thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the attaack on the big Kikuyu vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. There had been thirty men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">120	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">canoe and at least one man in the trees,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man who had killed M'Pembi. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could be all, or only a small part of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force. But there were only so many rogues</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the Congo. He did not know now how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the warriors had been recruited. As the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interpreter at Katumbo, Ismail had access</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the district police records. He had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a position to know the renegades of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every tribe, savage outlaws who had killed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before and who would kill again for lust,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or for drug-induced dreams, or for booty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The self-styled red-bearded black god had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">offered them all three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The trail was narrow and tangled with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vines that clutched at their feet like so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many green, malignant, blind snakes. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his eyes grew accustomed to the mist, Car-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ter could see that the vegetation here was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far more lush than any that he had ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seen before. This was truely a pre-his-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">&gt; toric world. Bushes grew to tree size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Trees grew into grotesque monstrosities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that towered into the mist. With every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">step he took, it became more difficult to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breath. It was like descending into some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fetid hot house. There was a stench of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rot and damp decay. A constant conden-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sation dripped from the leaves. Great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white and purple, loathsome, orchids clung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the bark of the trees like spiders. Sweat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started on his forehead as, far off, he heard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a distant roaring of some huge beast in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Tembu," K'Tooma, the leader of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Akesi, told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He described a large elephant with his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands, then licked his lips. "Sometimes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fall in hot spring. Boil."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Carter repressed a shudder with an ef-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fort. He was glad when the trumpeting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the dying beast had ceased. He could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not understand how Barney Sutliff had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crashed a plane in this white misted green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hell and lived. By questioning K'Tooma</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he learned that although the Leopard men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had never penetrated the valley that far,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the north end reputedly rose above the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">level of the south and was said to be rock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Several paces on, Nylabo stopped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">abruptly, stepped to one side of the trail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and placed a finger on his lips for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Carter stared into the mist, incredulous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What appeared to be two animated skele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tons, their bony hands dangling almost to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their bony knees, were climbing the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Houssa stopped in their tracks, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">black skin ashen, their breath hissing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No shooting!" Carter whispered. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand still!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the two skeletons came closer he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that they were men, huge, ape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like, Bakussu, their black bodies daubed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with white clay to give them their un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly appearance. The red-bearded black</seg><seg type="columnLine">god, still playing on the superstitions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives was posting a guard on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BOTH savages stunk of palm toddy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wove slightly from side to side as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they walked, not yet fully recovered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their orgy of the night before. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the frozen Houssa, both men raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">their assegais and charged with fiendish</seg><seg type="columnLine">glee expecting to plunge their broad blades</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the backs of frightened, running men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Houssa held. Nylabo and Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped from their places of concealment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped their hands over the ape men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths before the baffled killers could turn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plunged their knives repeatedly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bakussu's bare chests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was over in a moment. They died</seg><seg type="columnLine">without an outcry. Carter felt no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morse. These men and their kind had kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naped Ellen. He smiled grimly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burly-bodied skeleton slid from his knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was one distinct advantage in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a doctor in the Congo. A doctor knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to save lives. But he also knew how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill. His first thrust with the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plunged it into the would-be killer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Nylabo had dispatched his man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they halted for a brief consultation. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unlikely that other sentinels had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted. The black god was too certain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. They could push on with greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed now. Every moment might count.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> K'Tooma was certain that if the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded black god's camp was in the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would be at the north end where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were reputed to be rock caves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, and beyond the caves a tunnel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was said to lead under the hills and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nect with the old slave trail that wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">north-east out of the Congo across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wastes of the south Sudan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">RED ROGUE KILLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter and Nylabo still leading, the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">safari moved on again, now at a rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride, now at a fast dog trot.. It was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">K'Tooma had said. The heat remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense but the lush vegetation fell behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to be replaced by a crumbling rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which thousands of hot springs bub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled. Here there was no animal life but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few snakes, none of them deadly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out-sized vanka lizards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of a half hour's trek, a gldam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silver metal shone through the mist. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Barney Sutliff's plane. Both wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tail were crumpled. The motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wrenched free and bounded a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away. The door was sprung but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cabin was intact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter peered into it thoughtfully. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dried blood on the pilot's seat. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also a gaping hole where the two-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter pointed it out to Nylabo, Kaka,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and -K'Tooma. He knew the answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the questions that had puzzled him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew now why the red-bearded black</seg><seg type="columnLine">god's voice had so much force and why it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sounded so metallic. He was simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">using a radio amplifier connected to a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">portable battery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of his fear left Kaka. "Voice come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from box," he nodded sagely. "No God</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Allah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter took his place at the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safari and motioned it on again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted they had much farther to go. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs were growing fewer and were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">widely spaced. The mist had begui&gt; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half mile beyond the plane the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau began to climb in a rugged series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of slate stairs that some cataclysmic up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaval of the earth had formed. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot springs and the mist ceased abruptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across a level floor of stone a sheer face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock towered five hundred feet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> K'Tooma insisted, "It is the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley, Bwana Juju. Beyond here no men</seg><seg type="columnLine">may go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nylabo spat disdainfully. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed no camp. The sentries they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain on the trail had come from some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where. There must be some way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter's sharp eyes searching the barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a flash of movement between two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great boulders to their right and set flush</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down! Take cover behind the rocks!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words had hardly left his lips when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hideously painted warrior stepped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from between the boulders as if to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way was clear. A moment later a six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man patrol, armed only with long blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, trotted out from the cleft in the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed up the valley at a run. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were clouded with drugs. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so intent on what they had been sent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that they failed to see the men behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks although one warrior passed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the small boulder behind which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter was crouched that he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out and touched him with his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard stared after the patrol until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had disappeared into the mist, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back between the buolders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter thought grimly, "There goes my</seg><seg type="columnLine">execution squad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was logical to assume that the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">god had reasoned that while his ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors painted to resemble skeletons</seg><seg type="columnLine">might frighten off the Akesi and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houssa, that he and Nylabo would trek</seg><seg type="columnLine">on alone. They would have to work fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. There would be hell to pay when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patrol found the two sentries dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He motioned the Akesi and the Houssa</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay hidden and squirmed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space to the rock behind which Ny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">labo had crouched. "You take charge,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whispered tersely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nylabo stared at him, surprised. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">go where, Bwana Juju?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter explained, "I'm going to see if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't knock that guard out before he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise an alarm. I don't know how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men the black god has. But I do know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that We're outnumbered. Our only chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to surprise them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left the safety of the rock and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crawl. If another patrol should emerge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the patrol should chance to turn back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the guarda should come to the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--Carter hated to think what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen. Thirty feet from the rock he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied his shoes, kicked them off, got quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet and covered the rest of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance in a running crouch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Protected by the rock wall, he flattened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back against it until he could get his</seg><seg type="columnLine">122	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, then peered cautiously around one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big boulders into the dark of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard was quatted just inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance. He was a savage, middle-aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bakussa with an evil, dissipated, face. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter watched him he picked up a joint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beef and began to gnaw on it hungrily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing over his shoulder from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time as if expecting his relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter picked up a small pebble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed it out onto the rock plateau across</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he just had crawled. The savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">reacted as he expected him to. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebble clattered on the rock, he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meat, snatched up an assegai and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mouth of the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter swung his reversed gun like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">club. The blow stunned the barrel-chested</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage briefly but failed to knock him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A hoarse shout bursting from his throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped the assegai, whipped a knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his loin cloth and hurled himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The knife sliced down Carter's arm, slit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting his shirt sleeve from his shoulder to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrist and drawing a crimson line in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flesh. Desperate, he attempted to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse his gun and the huge savage knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it spinning from his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tabu no more," he grunted. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bwana Juju die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His stinking breath was hot and foul in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter's face as the white man fought des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately to escape from the powerful arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were slowly but certainly crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bakussu's flesh was greased beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">his paint. Carter twisted and turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat at the leering face now only inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his own, but he could not break the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold. His breath was coming in painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasps. Death was not far away.

His already glazing eyes incredu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous, the savage stepped back staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp tip of the assegai blade that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">prortuding from his bowels while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood shaft stood out behind him like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscene tail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Wah!"

The odds against them were heavy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood dripping from the long cut in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, he strode rapidly down the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the dim light at the far end.

They were fighting against</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE dim light became blazing sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine. The tunnel opened into a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cup-shaped valley, green, and fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile, and once beautiful. But the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded black god had turned it into a hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole and an abattoir. The stinking hides</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bloody bones of slaughtered cattle lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in heaps. Inside a high stake barricade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand young black men and women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a dozen different tribes, milled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked and groaned in pain as huge ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">groes, under the direction of Ismail, fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened rusted fetters and chains around their</seg><seg type="columnLine">necks. Wearing a snow white burnoose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ismail darted among them, driving them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into their places in the slave train with</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy blows of a kibokos, the native whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">made from Hippo hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great piles of tusks, some gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, some green with age, dotted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the valley waiting to be shouldered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the slaves. Here and there were smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">piles covered with matting and guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by painted warriors. These Carter knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gold. Gold washed laboriously from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rivers of the Congo and hoarded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">porcupine quills against a day of famine</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they could be traded to the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men for life. The wealth represented was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous. In the short time that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been operating, at the cost of a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap tricks, and by catering to the baser</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of a hundred renegades who killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the love of killing, the red-bearded</seg><seg type="columnLine">black god and Ismail had stolen enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">RED ROGUE KILLER	123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, and ivory, and slaves to net them</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of thousand of pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an effort, he turned his eyes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slave stockade to the hills. The green</seg><seg type="columnLine">slopes were dotted with caves. Ellen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being held in one of them. The question</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, which one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stood hesitating, a drunken rene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gade Masai, obviously the relief that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead Bakussu had been expecting, stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered up the slope toward the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter retreated a few feet into the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tunnel. "Don't kill him," he or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. "But don't let him cry out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes blinded briefly by the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">transition of light to gloomy half-light, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai did not see the men at first. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did and opened his mouth to shout a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, Nylabo pressed an assegai against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat so hard that the sharp point</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced the skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cry out and you die!" he warned him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man attempted to collect his be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuddled wits. He glanced fearfully over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder. "Do I not cry out, I die."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nylabo shrugged and told him in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own language. "The choice is with you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we have not walked this long way with</seg><seg type="columnLine">death for boori. Either tell us where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white memsahib with hair like the midday</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun is being held a captive or--" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed his assegai a little harder until a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivulet of blood ran down the man's painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Talk," Carter ordered, "or so help me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll stake you on art ant hill. Where are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they holding the girl ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Masai wet his lips and pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cave. "She and the red-bearded black</seg><seg type="columnLine">god are together, bwana " he said pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "But if the bwana should try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the cave he will surely died. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-bearded black god has said so."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter fingered the butt of his gun. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He considered the location of the cave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To reach it, he would have to circle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. It would be a simple matter at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. But night was hours away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every moment counted. At any moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could expect to hear the excited shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the returning patrol, racing back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp with news that the sentries were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and that the spoor found on the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that of Bwana Juju. If he could res-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cue Ellen and get back to the tunnel before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alarm was sounded, even with as few</seg><seg type="columnLine">men as he had, they would have an excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent chance of fighting their way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Valley of the Lost Ones to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper reaches of the N'gesi and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You come with me, Nylabo," he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his decision. "The rest of you stay here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cover us as best you can. If we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">run into trouble we should be back in half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour. If we do," he shrugged. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do, you'll have to fight your own way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back as best you can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Together the two men slipped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel into the screening green. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they had covered half the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cave, the roaring of orders and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack of the whip had stopped. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires that had been used to forge fetters</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the savory odor of roasting meat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter looked at the sun and cursed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the hour of the mid-day meal. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that the confusion below them would</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now crawling across a bare spot on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellies, now running crouched from tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tree, they reached a spot fifty feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave, unseen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nylabo listened intently, said sadly, "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai did not lie.

But she weeps, bwana, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeps, after the manner of her kind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Carter gritted his teeth. If the foul fiends</seg><seg type="columnLine">had harmed Ellen--he realized his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotence and scowled. The odds against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were even worse than he had fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured. If he and Nylabo were discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they could return with Ellen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel the best they could hope for would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a sudden death. It was far more likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be tortured, perhaps staked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an ant heap as he had threatened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INCH by inch they crawled to the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the screening trees and underbrush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Carter cocked his gun and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the remaining open space followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by ISiylabo. Whether they had been seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor of the valley or not, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no way of knowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen had been kneeling beside a cot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back to the mouth of the cave.

She took a short step back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, staring at Carter as though he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ghost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One hand caught at her throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're dead. They told me you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter shook her lightly, smiled, "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you believe it. Come on. We're getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes lighted with hope, then grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull. Tears streamed down her cheeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can't go, I can't," she sobbed. "I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave Barney. He's sick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn Barney!" Carter rapped. "He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but a--" He broke off and whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the mouth of the cave as a ripple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shots echoed from the lip of the tunnel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed a moment later by shrill cries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage that swiftly turned into shouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. The blow gun patrol that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to kill him had returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too late to escape quietly now. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got out at all, they would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight their way. He swung back and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the figure on the cot. The man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge and red bearded. He was as dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his sister was fair, and further burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep copper by the sun. A dirty' blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained bandage was wound around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. His eyes were bright with fever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay. So they may get us," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtly. "But first, I'll get the dirty killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind this." He pressed the muzzle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun to the other man's temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Steve, please," Ellen sobbed. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't understand. Barney isn't the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded black god. He's just a figurehead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's been ill, out of his head since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed. They've just been using him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scape goat. The real brain behind all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter swung back toward the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave as a man chuckled softly--"is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called Captain Dennis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him, Ismail leered, "May Allah</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mercy on his soul."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big, florid-faced man eyed Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amusement. "So we meet again." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-smile faded from his lips. "Bah. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to get in my hair. So help me, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons of my own I did not want to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I wanted you to live. But you insist on</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter saw the whole thing now--too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. He had been stupid. The real Captain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis was dead, murdered for his pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port and his papers. This man was Cort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf, the escaped murderer and bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranger who somehow had wangled Barney</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sutliff into flying him out of South Africa</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Congo. He lifted the gun in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand until the muzzle leveled on Wolf's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's to keep me from killing you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ellen," the other man smiled. "If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should die, it might prove unpleasant for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. You know Ismail slightly I believe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And without my restraining influence, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would undoubtedly sell the girl with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of our merchandise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter lowered the gun. The thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ellen sold as a slave was unspeakable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He started to speak, stopped suddenly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized that Nylabo was no longer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wolf laughed uproariously at his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression. "Perhaps you realize by now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your magic is not as good as it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be," he spat the words scornfully, "Bwana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juju. Your Zulu boy has more sense than</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have. When he saw Ismail and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming he dropped his assegai and scram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled up the slope as fast as he could go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice grew cold. "Now drop that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun or so help me we'll strip and whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl before you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter allowed the gun to thud to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. "So now what happens to me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wolf picked up the gun and weighed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his palm. "I have not yet decided," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HOT heavy blackness of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed against Carter's eyelids like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. There was no sound in the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the hoarse breathing of the dying man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the soft sobbing of the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wolf had timed his departure well. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave train, loaded with its stolen booty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moving out when the moon had fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen. Barney Sutliff would die before it</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. Even now his breathing had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter strained vainly at the baobab</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes that bound his wrists and ankles. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was useless. They were even tighter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been, shrunken by the night dew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">RED ROGUE KILLER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Grim-eyed, he rolled to the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave and stared down into the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was like looking into some red hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">peopled by shrieking black demons. Fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastically painted figures leaped and howled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the fires as they enjoyed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost the last disgusting debauch in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf was indulging his men. From time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time one of them would stagger into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake stockade to reappear with a scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing young female slave who would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to join in the orgy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the valley, in the lip of the tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel, an occasional streak of orange still</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted the night as the trapped Houssa</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Akesi fought a losing battle. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attackers could not get at them, but neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">could they escape. They were trapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two fires and doomed to die of</seg><seg type="columnLine">starvation if the blow-guns and hurled as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">segais did not kill them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter thought of Nylabo and winced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Zulu's desertion hurt him. After all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had been through together, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't seem credible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen stopped her soft sobbing asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are they going to do with us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve?" The girl was unbound but two</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil-faced Bakussu stood guard outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave, glancing in from time to time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make certain that she did not attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">release Carter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," Carter answered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">truthfully. "But Wolf can't afford to al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low me to live. He knows that I'll see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him hanged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE LAY reviewing the past few days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sutliff had never been connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the raids. It had been Wolf and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ismail from the first. They had planned this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for months, perhaps for years. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German had not been lying when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that he had wanted Carter to live.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There had been a good reason for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing was fiendishly clever. Wolf</seg><seg type="columnLine">had led the attack on the Kikuyu village</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had then had his own men leave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied and gagged where Carter's men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be certain to find him. His plan had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple but clever. Fie had met the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Dennis in the jungle and had mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered him. But by posing as Captain Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nis, he achieved two ends. He cleared his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hands of the murder. As Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dennis he definitely pinned the blame for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">everything on Sutliff by swearing to Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter that with his own eyes he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the famous soldier of fortune leading the</seg><seg type="columnLine">renegade warriors. And after the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported savage fight at the Akesi village</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which he and Ellen had been kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naped, Carter would be forced to swear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the renegades had seized him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">death would be regretted as that of a brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">man killed by drug-inflamed savages under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orders of Sutliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter stared through the gloom at Sut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liff. He felt sorry for the man. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf had induced him to fly him out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Transvaal and crash in the Valley of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost Ones was something that they prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably would never know. It had undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly been done at gun point. One thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certain. After pinning his brief but</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody reign of terror onto Barney Sut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liff by building him up in the minds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superstitious natives as a self-styled</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-bearded black god, Cort Wolf would</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear and what the ants had left of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sutliff''s body would eventually be iden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tified by the searching parties who found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as the body of Cort Wolf. Wolf had</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted as much. He had boasted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was assuming a new identity under</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he would be enabled to spend his</seg><seg type="columnLine">looted fortune safely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scuff of feet outside the cave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the challenge of the guards brought Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sitting position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dressed for the long trek to the coast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf strode in followed by Ismail and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged native with a basin of water and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His red face was more florid than usual.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been drinking but he was far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk.

Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were attempting to stamp out the fires that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly transformed them into tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets.

Get them moving 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf bellowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond him, in the reflected gleam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fire not yet quite stamped out, Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see Ellen, her face buried in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, seated in a litter carried by four</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Ismail was standing beside the litter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her .505 Gibbs in his hands, an evil scowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face as he looked up into the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a flash of movement at which to shoot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On.

Wolf</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDER the lash of the whips, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodding of assegais, the lumbering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy-laden, human train moved forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly toward a small cleft in the hills on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sudan side of the cup. Carter recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized Wolf's strategy. It was useless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to comb the hills in the moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">but once the slave train was out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley it would be safe. Wolf had a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred warriors against a handful. On level</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, the Akesi would not stand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He plunged on through the underbrush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting, "Head them off, K'Tooma.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't allow them to pass through the gap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blood curdling screech of a leopard</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ismail fired at the sound of Carter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and the heavy slug smacked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk of a tree only inches from his ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regardless of the noise he made, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">target that he presented, he plunged on</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the slope toward the spot where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had last seen the litter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he reached the floor of the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shouted, "Slaves, rise up against your</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil masters. Strike them down with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains. The red-bearded black god is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. He can no longer harm you. Bwana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juju tells you so!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The screaming and moaning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chained slaves ceased. It was replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a low, growing roar. There were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors in the train who did not wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chins with pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He lies," Wolf shouted desperately, em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phasizing his words with pistol-like cracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his whip. "Move on lest the wrath of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red-bearded black god strike you dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ellen cried out from the litter, "He lies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not Bwana Juju.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">very bands of iron on your wrists are</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slave train swayed, undecided. Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter had almost reached the litter when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of twenty slaves broke from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the line and hurled themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the renegades who a moment before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been their masters. They clawed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with their hands and beat at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil faces with the heavy irons on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists until nothing was left but bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another group left the train. And still</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, and another. The tables had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly turned. The slaves had become the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters. Some of the renegades fought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging their bloody assegais time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">time again into the press of bodies before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they died. Others fled shrieking into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills to be run down by the Leopard men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mangled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter plunged on toward Ismail. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab had expended all of the shells in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. As Carter loomed out of the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light he threw it from him and drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">128	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knife only to have it fall from nerveless</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers as Nylabo's assegai pierced his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter held Ellen, briefly. "You're all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she had told him she was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed, he left her in Nylabo's care while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fought his way through the surge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf. He found him encircled by slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were battering at him with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains while he begged hoarsely for mercy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter started to interfere, then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again toward Ellen. It was Kismet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The German was dying as he should die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were certain natural laws of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. One of them was that all men</seg><seg type="columnLine">born in it were free. And Wolf had defied</seg><seg type="columnLine">that law. It was right that he die under</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time that Carter had forced his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back to the litter, Ellen was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it, her golden hair gleaming in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight. The noise of battle was dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and the former moaning of the slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been replaced with a rising triumphant</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant accompanied by the clash of fetters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here and there in the hills a gun flashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.
