            <seg type="columnLine">more murders at his door, but their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hands were tied. Linky's reign of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">terror wras so completely dominating</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the toughest of the tough simply</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a thing was entirely too dangerous.</seg>
