            <seg type="columnLine">Ginger whose face was flushed through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the tan with liquor and excitement. A</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the sort of scheme that would hatch in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">came to a decision that the pearls were</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">They had sprung largely from the fact</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The idea seemed a good one, so they</seg>
