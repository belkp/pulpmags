                    <ab>Have tried the Vacu-matic and it sure is fine. Better pick-up with a 30% gas
                        sav- ing—John C. Martin, Pa.</ab>
                    <ab>Plymouth</ab>
                    <ab>I am amazed at Vacu-matic per-formance. It's giv-ing me 5 more miles per
                        gallon. -Walter Zielinski, Ill.</ab>
                    <ab>V-8 Ford</ab>
                    <ab>I installed both Vacu-matics and they work excel-lent. On my own V8 Ford I
                        notice wonderful perfor-mance in pick up, get-away and gas saving.- Burt
                        Burnett, Mich.</ab>
                    <ab>Buick</ab>
                    <ab>Everything you claim about Vacu matic is true. I now get 20 miles to the
                        gallon. Be-fore I was only averaging 15 1/2 miles. - C. Constantino,
                        Fla.</ab>
                    <ab>Franklin</ab>
                    <ab>With Vacu-matic I have increased my mileage from 10.1 to 14.2 miles per
                        gallon. I figure I save over $75.00 a year in gasoline. R.K. Radtke.

                    <ab>Saves $180 A Year</ab>
                    <ab> On my Plymouth 6 I obtained an average of 22 miles per gallon, an increase
                        of 7 miles. This means a savings of $15 a month or $180 a year. F S. Peck,

                    <ab>Chevrolet</ab>
                    <ab>Please send me a Vacu-matic for a Model A. The milage on my 1933 Chevro-let
                        jumped from 18 to 22 miles per gal. with Vacu-matic.- Paul P. Haas,
                        Mass.</ab>
                    <ab>All Well Pleased</ab>
                    <ab>Enclosed find order for 12 more. Everyone I have sold is giving 4-to-6 more
                        miles per gallon. I have 3 more orders for V8 Ford. Every body is well
                        pleased. -J.O. Carll, Texas.</ab>
                    <ab>Model A Ford</ab>
                    <ab>Have been using the Vacu-matci for a month. I used to get 20 to 22 miles per
                        gal. Now I get 30 to 33 miles It is amazing the difference it makes. -James
                        W. Barr, Canada.</ab>
                    <ab>Nash</ab>
                    <ab>On my Advanced 6 Nash gained 17 1/2% in milaeage. The car will idle down to
                        3 miles inan hour and then take gas with-out a complaint. -J.Showalter,

                    <ab>Just complieted 2310 miles on 92 gallons in my 1933 Dodge 6. This figures 25
                        miles while befoer I aver-aged only 20 miles per gal. on trips. -Al Fruzyna,

                    <ab>I am well pleased with Vacu-matic on our Olds-mobile. A test proved it to

                    <ab>AT LAST! Automotive engineers have smashed down the barriers to perfected
                        combustion! The new VACU-MATIC solves the secret of greater power! With
                        almost magical action, this amazing inven- tion instantly puts new life and
                        pep in any motor. It adds mileage to every gallon of gasoline . . . produces
                        split-second pick-up, sensitive accelerator response, greater speed and
                        smoother running </ab>

                        VACU-MATIC! The greatest motor improvement of recent years! With it,
                        engineers have achieved a practical means of balancing air and gasoline
                        automatically for all speeds: Vacu-matic is entirely different! It is
                        AUTOMATIC and allows the motor to “breathe” at the correct time, opening and
                        closing automatically as required. No idling troubles—no carburetor
                        adjust-ments necessary. Just put it on and forget it! Sharply cuts fuel
                        wastes, saves dollars in gas costs, reduces carbon and gives your engine new
                        pep, greater power and longer life.</ab>
                    <ab>Fits All Cars</ab>
                    <ab>VACU-MATIC is constructed of six parts, assembled and welded into one unit,
                        correctly adjusted and sealed at the-factory. Nothing to regulate. Any
                        motorist can attach VACU- MATIC in ten minutes. Once in, its only reminder
                        is the surge of instant power and speed it gives to the motor and the
                        savings it affords your pocketbook.</ab>

                        <ab>The only man who could talk to the Superintendent</ab>
                        <ab>For several years, he was just like a score of other men in the plant—a
                            good, honest, fairly capable worker, but only that. There was nothing
                            distinc-tive about him or his ability—nothing to make him stand out from
                            the crowd—no reason, as a matter of fact, why he should ever receive a
                            raise.</ab>
                        <ab>Then one fortunate day he decided that the reason he wasn’t getting
                            anywhere was because he lacked special training. He searched around a
                            bit —asked a great many questions—and then en- rolled for a home-study
                            course with the Inter- national Correspondence Schools.</ab>
                        <ab>“Soon after I began studying," he wrote to us the other day, “we had a
                            change in management at our plant. The new superintendent said that

                            foremen. “I certainly was glad then that I had decided to study in my
                            spare time. For, thanks to my I. C. S. course, I was the only man in the
                            organization who could talk to the superintendent in his own lan-guage.
                            As a result, I was promoted over men who had been here from ten to
                            twenty years.”</ab>
                        <ab>What are you doing with the hours after supper? Can you afford to let
                            them slip by unimproved when you can easily make them mean so much? One

                        <ab>In a letter dated January 7, 1935, Mrs, Bostic says, “I have just had

                        <ab>How do you know you can't WRITE?</ab>
                        <ab>Have you ever tried?</ab>
                        <ab>Have you ever attempted even the least bit or training, under competent
                            guidance?</ab>
                        <ab>Or have you been sitting back, as it is so easy to do, waiting for the
                            day to come some time when you will awaken, all of a sudden, to the
                            discovery, “I am a writer”? If the latter course is the one of your
                            choosing, you probably never will write. Lawyers must be law clerks.
                            Doctors must be internes. Engineers must be draftsmen. We all know that,
                            in our times, the egg does come before the chicken.</ab>
                        <ab>It is seldom that any one becomes a writer until he (or she) has been
                            writing for some time. That is why so many authors and writers spring up
                            out of the newspaper business. The day-to-day necessity of writing—of
                            gathering material about which to write —develops their talent, their
                            background and their confidence as nothing else could. That is why the
                            Newspaper Institute of America bases its writing instruction on
                            journalism—con- tinuous writing—the training that has produced so many
                            successful authors.</ab>

                        <ab>NEWSPAPER Institute training is based on the New York Copy-Desk Method.
                            It starts and keeps you writing in your own home, on your own time. Week
                            by week you receive actual assignments, just as if you were right at
                            work on a great metropolitan daily. Your writing is individually
                            corrected and constructively criticized. A group of men, whose combined
                            newspaper experience totals more than 200 years, are responsible for
                            this instruction. Un-der such sympathetic guidance, you will find that
                            (instead of vainly trying to copy some one else’s writing tricks) you
                            are rapidly developing your own distinctive, self-flavored
                            style—undergoing an experience that has a thrill to it and which at the
                            same time de- velops in you the power to make your feelings articulate.
                            Many people who should be writing become awe-struck by fabulous stories
                            about millionaire authors and, therefore, give little thought to the
                            $25, $50 and $100 or more that can often be earned for ma- terial that
                            takes little time to write—stories, articles on business, fads, travels,
                            sports, recipes, etc.—things that can easily be turned out in leisure
                            hours, and often on the impulse of the moment.</ab>

                    <ab>You have 9 million tiny tubes or filters in your kidneys, which are at work
                        night and day cleaning out Acids and poisonous wastes and purifying your
                        blood, which circulates through your kidneys 200 times an hour. So it’s no
                        wonder that poorly functioning Kidneys may be the real cause of feeling
                        tired, run-down, nervous, Getting Up Nights, Rheumatic Pains and other

                    <ab>Nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poorly functioning Kidneys at times

                    <ab>City Health Doctor Praises Cystex</ab>
                    <ab>Dr. W.R. George</ab>
                    <ab>Doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the prescription Cystex because
                        of its splendid ingredients and quick action. For instance, Dr. W. R.
                        George, graduate Medical Dept., University of Indiana, former Health
                        Commissioner of Indianapolis, and Medical Di- rector for insurance company
                        10 year, recently wrote the following letter:</ab>
                    <ab>"There is little question but what properly func- tioning Kidney and Bladder
                        organs are vital to tbe health. Insufficient Kidney excretions are the cause
                        of much needless suffering with aching back, weakness, painful joints and
                        rheumatic pains, headaches and a general run-down, exhausted body. This
                        condition also interferes with normal rest at night by causing the sufferer
                        to rise frequently for relief, and results in painful excretion, itching,
                        smarting and burning. I am of the opinion that Cystex definitely corrects
                        frequent causes (poor kidney functions) of such conditions and I have
                        actually prescribed in my own practice for many years past the same
                        ingredients contained in your formula. Cystex not only exerts a splendid in-
                        fluence in flushing poisons from the urinary tract, but also has an
                        antiseptic action and assists in freeing the blood of retained toxins.
                        Believing as I do that so meritorious a product deserves the endorsement of
                        the Medical Profession, I am happy indeed to lend my name and photograph for
                        your use in advertising Cystex." Signed W. R. George, M. D.</ab>

                            I could hardly walk across the room. After taking one bottle of Nacor, I
                            could do most of my housework. That was 8 years ago. I am still feeling

                        <ab>A Test Every Man Past 40 Should Make!</ab>
                        <ab>MEDICAL authorities now say that mil- lions of men over 40 suffer from
                            dis- order of one of the most important male glands—the prostate. After
                            age 5O, says one important writer, the chances are 2 to 1 that you have
                            some prostate derangement.</ab>
                        <ab>This, gland disorder is seldom mentioned, by laymen, but millions will
                            recognize the symptoms. When prostate “hypertrophy” is present the
                            victim, usually suffers broken sleep —he has to get up 2 to 10 times a
                            night; he has other “bladder” symptoms: frequently com- plains of aching
                            feet, legs and back; and often suffers unexplained “blues” and loss of
                            strength and ambition.</ab>
                        <ab>If you are suffering from this gland weakness you should write at once
                            for the sensational book “Why Many Men Are Old At 40.” It is now being
                            given away, free, by the institution which recently perfect a
                            marvelously simple drugless relief for this gland disorder. This method,
                            called Thermalaid, has already been tested by over 100,000 men.
                            Thousands upon thousands have already written grateful letters
                            describing their quick and often seemingly permanent relief from
                            prostate symptoms.</ab>
                        <ab>Do not hesitate. Send for this book now. You will also learn of a
                            generous test offer now being made by the manufacturer of Thermalaid, to
                            prostate gland sufferers. This test will prove the merit of Thermalaid

                        by his fiancee, Gina Mornington. Hating to tell his father, who has never
                        seen Gina, what has happened, he persuades Janice to pose as his fiancee for
                        a month. Roger's father has a stroke, and before he dies he begs Roger to
                        marry Janice. After the old man's death, Roger insists that they pretend
                        that they are happily married. He also forbids her to continue her
                        friendship with Sefton Arlen, a neighbor friend. Roger and Janice become
                        good friends, and Janice hopes that Roger is learning to love her when Gina
                        Mornington returns, determined to win Roger for herself. Roger comes down
                        with an attack of fever, and Janice is with him when he takes her in his
                        arms and kisses her, telling her he loves her, but calling her Gina.</ab>

                    <ab>MEN AND WOMEN EVERYWHERE AMAZED AT RESULTS</ab>
                    <ab>Thousands of thin, pale, rundown folks- and even "Naturally Skinny" men and
                        women are amazed at this new easy way to put on healthy needed pounds
                        quickly. Gains of 15 to 20 lbs. in one month, 5 lbs. in 1 week, are reported
                        regularly.</ab>
                    <ab>Kelpamalt, the new mineral concentrate from the sea, gels right down to the
                        cause of thin, underweight conditions and adds weight through a 2 ways in 1
                        natural process.</ab>
                    <ab>First, its rich supply of easily assimilable minerals stimulates the
                        diges-tive glands which produce the juices that alone enable you to digest
                        fats and starches, the weight-making elements in your daily diet. And these
                        minerals are needed by virtually every organ and for every function of the
                        body. Second, Kelpamalt is rich in NATURAL IODINE- a mineral needed by the
                        vital organ which regulates metabo-lism- the process through which the body
                        is constantly building firm, solid flesh, new strength and energy 6
                        Kelpamalt tablets contain more NATURAL IODINE than 486 lbs. of spinach or
                        1660 lbs. of beef. More iron and copper than 2 lbs. of spinach or 15 lbs. of
                        fresh toma- toes. More calcium than 1 doz. eggs. More phosphorus than 3 lbs.
                        of carrots.</ab>
                    <ab>Try Kelpamalt for a single week and notice the difference- how much better
                        you sleep, how ordinary stomach distress vanishes, how firm flesh appears in
                        place of scrawny hollows and the new energy and strength it brings you.
                        Kelpamalt is prescribed and used by physicians. Fine for children, too.
