                                          One of the most suprising tales we have ever read. (This story was scheduled for the May issue, but had to

                              <ab>A perfect little typewriter for $1.50. There are thousands of persons who would like to use a typewriter but whose
                                    needs and business do not war-rant the expense attached to the pur-chase and use of a fifty or seventy-five dollar
                                    machine. To such persons we confidently recommend our Little Giant. It is strongly made, but simple in
                                    construction, so that anyone can quickly learn to operate it, and write as rapidly as they would with pen and ink.
                                    The letters of the alphabet most frequently used are so grouped as to enable one to write rapidly, the numerals 1
                                    to 10, and the punctuation marks being together. With this machine you can send your best girl typewritten love
                                    letters, address envelipes, make out bills, and do almost any kind of work not requiring large, expensive machine.
                                    With each typewriter we send a tube of ink and full printed instructions for using the machine. Price com-plete

                                    mechan-ism to wind up as is usually understood with mechanical toys, yet this tank will keep plodding along ten
                                    times longer than the ordinary run of toys. It will perform dozens of the most wonderful stunts; it will go

                              <ab>Hold the MAGIC INDICATOR over a man's hand—instantly it moves in a straight line, back-ward and forward. Hold it
                                    over a woman's hand and it describes a complete and continuous circle. The same action can be obtained over a
                                    letter written by a man or woman, etc. It is fascinating; baffling. We have never been able to figure out how it's
                                    done—but we've never seen it fail. Many novel and entertaining feats may be performed with the Sex Indicator. For
                                    example, similar results can be obtained with animals, cats, dogs, rabbits, over birds, chickens, canaries, etc.
                                    Also used to predetermine the sex of chickens and birds, etc., in fact it is sold as a patented egg tester in

                              <ab>The Magic Flute, or Human-stone, is a unique and novel instrument that is played with nose and mouth combined. There
                                    is just a little knack in playing it which, when once ac-quired after a little practice will enable you to produce
                                    very sweet music that somewhat resembles a flute. There is no fingering, and once you have mastered it you can
                                    play all kinds of music with facility and ease. When played as an accomponiment to a piano or any other musical
                                    instrument, the effect is as charming as it is surprising.</ab>

                                    speakers, etc. Many fasci-nating stunts may be devised, such as holding the button against the throat or chest to
                                    reproduce speech without sound waves. $5.00 is given to anyone who sends in new suggestion for the use of the

                                    <span type="columnLine">than thirty shillings, and he appealed to his com-</span>

                                    <span type="columnLine">of considerable intimacy. This gave Mr. Cave an</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">opportunity of collecting his thoughts, and he began</span>

                                    <span type="columnLine">sale. His two customers were naturally surprised</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">at this, and inquired why he had not thought of</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">that before he began to bargain. Mr. Cave became</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">confused, but he stuck to his story, that the crystal</span>

                                    <span type="columnLine">struggling between the two guards who evidently</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">held her back from a dangerous proximity to my</span>

                                    <span type="columnLine">and I felt a sudden regret that I had not been able</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">to tell her good-bye. I was half inclined to stop</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">my growth for a few minutes, but, instead, I knelt</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">down far enough away from her for safety, and</span>

                                    days; sleep inducing nights; wonderful bathing; suc- cessful fishing; boating, riding, tramping,—en- joying life
                                    to the full. The air is laden with deli- cate odors of dogwood, yellow jasmine, giant blue- berry, magnolia and a

                              <ab>Villa Tasso is in the Florida National Forest on the bluffs of beautiful Chocta- whatchee Bay, 50 miles east of
                                    Pensacola. It is easily reached either by steamer or by motor, being adjacent to the Appalachian Scenic Highway,
                                    Old Spanish Trail and the Cult Resorts Loop. It is high, dry and healthful. The water is sweet, pure and soft.
                                    Only 3½ miles from the Gulf of Mexico, it is still well sheltered from any possible storms. Delightful bathing
                                    beach. Game abounds in the Forest.</ab>
                              <ab>Because it is only slightly developed as yet, you can still buy in this lovely spot a wonderful homesite for from
                                    $300 to $2000 -one-tenth of what less desirable lots would cost you elsewhere. The lots are large (standard size
                                    50 x 150 feet), title guaran- teed perfect, the location ideal. Plenty of shade from pine, oak, magnolia, holly,
                                    sweet gum, bay, and other attractive trees; camphor and palms grow well, when planted. As a home or an investment
                                    you will find this hard to duplicate. Write for il- lustrated booklet and prices.</ab>
                              <ab>SPECIAL OFFER: To secure as much development as possible this spring, a special rebate of 20% is offered to every
                                    purchaser who begins his home before June 1st, 1926. Details on request.</ab>

                                    northern New Jersey and New York during the last year. These girls, it is claimed, were actually sold to 200 "road

                                    attractive salaries; Those whose beauty of face and figure marked them for their doom were snared and shown the
                                    "easy road" to a life of luxury.</ab>
                              <ab>But was it really the lure of a "life of luxury" that dragged these girls down to a life of shame? Or was it the
                                    hideous ruthlessness with which the ring operated? Or was it perhaps some terrify- ing, mysterious influence which
                                    these monsters in human form had upon the minds of certain young women?</ab>
                              <ab>Such are some of the horrifying questions with which Richard E. Enright deals in his sensation- al series of
                                    articles on the "White Slave" Traffic. Commencing in the April issue of Police Stories, Enright takes up every
                                    phase of this infamous commerce in hapless human beings. He traces the "traffic in souls" in New York from 1900 to
                                    the present day and gives the public the full facts.</ab>
                              <ab>No mother or father who has a daughter, nor anyone who has a heartfelt interest in the welfare of any helpless,
                                    innocent young girl, can afford to miss a single page of these astonishing disclos- ures. Enright has accepted the
                                    editorship of Police Stories so that he may continue to be of real service to New York. His series on the "White
                                    Slave" Traffic is the first of many sensa- tional disclosures regarding social evils which he will try to
                                    eradicate.</ab>
