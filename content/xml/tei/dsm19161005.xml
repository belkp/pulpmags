                        <span type="columnLine">Missouri, was introduced by Harry Naster, a butcher, of No. 1003 East</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">Eighteenth Street, to Mr. Grossman:</span>

                    <ab><span type="columnLine">Grossman explained he had disposed of all his jewelry stock in St. Louis,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">except nine pounds of pure gold, melted into small, coin-shaped pieces. He was</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">willing to sell the gold for one hundred dollars a pound, he said, half its value,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">because he had been called out of town hurriedly on a long trip and was afraid</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">to take it with him. Clayman desired to see the gold.</span>
                    </ab>
                    <ab><span type="columnLine">Grossman opened a shoe box he had under his arm. The box was lined</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">with cotton, on which were many bright-yellow disks. </span>
                    </ab>
                    <ab><span type="columnLine">"I'd buy them myself, if I had the money," volunteered Naster. "Maybe I</span>

                    </ab>
                    <ab><span type="columnLine">Then Clayman decided he would buy the gold.</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">man, producing several disks like those in the box. </span>
                    </ab>
                    <ab><span type="columnLine">Clayman went to a jeweler, who said the samples were pure gold, worth</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">$247.20 a pound. Clayman returned, stopping at the bank to get nine hundred</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">dollars in gold money, and counted it out in Grossman's palm. Grossman took</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">back the samples.</span>
                    </ab>
                    <ab><span type="columnLine">That night Clayman carried the treasure home with him.</span>

                    <ab><span type="columnLine">Misgivings overtook Clayman the next day. He put the box under his arm</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and went hatless to his jeweler friend. The jeweler began his examination, then</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">looked up with a start.</span>
                    </ab>
                    <ab><span type="columnLine">"These are brass," he said.</span>
