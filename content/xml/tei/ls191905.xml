                        so fleet!â€” To leave the story incomplete; Dreams, are ye worth the ache you cost? No loveliest face can e'er repeat The faces

                    <ab>I THINK it was one spring a burning bush Flamed sudden in the green hills of my youth, And a great voice spake out of it the
                        truth Of Beauty and fell still. A holy hush Succeeded it. There was not any noise Of singing birds or rivers or of flowers
                        Stirring in birth, but all the level hours Were very silent, as when nuns rejoice.</ab>
                    <lb/>
                    <ab>New breath of a new Spring, how many Springs Have been since then? Since wild my dark eyes sighted The amazing Bush with awe
                        and frenzy lighted; And since my cars heard great imaginings Voiced in eternal tones? I do not know: The years are filled with
                        blinding, deafening woe.</ab>

                <ab>
                    <span type="columnLine">And that evening, before going to collect, you dolled up with your best red</span>

                    <span type="columnLine">your nose looked sorta red, so you dabbed it with a bit of your sister's powder and</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">then rubbed it off for fear it might show and SHE would think you were a sissie.</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">When you went to her house SHE was out on the front porch with her father and</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">her mother and her sisters and her brothers and her cousins and her uncles and her</span>

                    <span type="columnLine">turned up her pretty, stubby little nose when you suggested going to the drug store</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">for an ice cream suddy. And you gloomily wondered if she were going to renege</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">on the bet, and you looked at her with a meaning look in your face, while she blankly</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">returned your gaze without a sign of comprehension, and her dad, noting your</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">strange appearance, asked you if your face hurt. Her mother looked at your fawn</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">gloves and snickered, and you felt yourself getting red, and your hands were large</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">and hot, and you put them behind you and tried to take off the gloves, but they</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">simply wouldn't come!</span>

                    <span type="columnLine">that one of the aunts, an old maid who was sweet on the widower who had just gone</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">by without paying much attention to her, said: "For goodness' sake, keep still if</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">you haven't the St. Vitus' dance." At that you colored up again like a cerise sun-</span>

                    <span type="columnLine">You hitched closer and closer to HER and she looked at you shyly and didn't move</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">away. Then she lifted up her pretty face a little as you took a firm grip on your</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">courage andâ€”and gave her a quick little peck on the cheek. At that you heard a</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">loud laugh and you looked around shamefacedly and there was her father! And he</span>
                    <span type="columnLine">said:</span>

                    <span type="columnLine">kicked yourself all around the block and upstairs to your room and then you swore</span>
