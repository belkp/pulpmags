                              <ab>IN THE sun the shadow tracery of the grille's symbolic pattern lay vividly out- lined on the ground. The girl gave a
                                    little gasp of delight. She dropped Smith's hand and ran forward three short steps, and plunged into the very
                                    center of that shadowy pattern on the ground. And what happened then was too incredible to believe.</ab>
                              <ab>The pattern ran over her like a garment, curving to the curve of her body in the way all shadows do. But as she
                                    stood there striped and laced with the darkness of it, there came a queer shifting in the lines of black tracery,
                                    a subtle, inexplicable movement to one side. And with that motion she vanished. It was exactly as if that shifting
                                    had moved her out of one world into another. Smith stared stupidly at the spot from which she had
                                    disappeared.</ab>
                              <ab>Then several things happened almost simultaneously. The zoom of an airplane broke suddenly into the quiet, a black
                                    shadow dipped low over the rooftops, and Smith, too late, realized that he stood defenseless in full view of the
                                    searching ships. There was only one way out, and that was too fantastic to put faith in, but he had no time to
                                    hesitate. With one leap he plunged full into the midst of the shadow of the tree of life.</ab>
                              <ab>Its tracery flowed round him, molding its pattern to his body. And outside the boundaries everything executed a
                                    queer little sidewise dip and slipped in the most extraordinary manner, like an optical illusion, into quite
                                    another scene. There was no intervention of blankness. It was as if he looked through the bars of a grille upon a
                                    picture which without warning slipped sidewise, while between the bars ap- peared another scene, a curious, dim
                                    landscape, gray as if with the twilight of early evening. The air had an oddly thickened look, through which he
                                    saw the quiet trees and the flower-spangled grass of the place with a queer, unreal blending, like the landscape
                                    in a tapestry, all its outlines blurred.</ab>
                              <ab>In the midst of this tapestried twilight the burning whiteness of the girl he had followed blazed like a flame. She
                                    had paused a few steps away and stood waiting, apparently quite sure that he would come after. . . .</ab>
