                        <span type="columnLine">long—Coulson scarcely ate or slept. He</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">tramped the beaches, he paddled far out to</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">sea, trying mechanically to find relief in</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">fatigue, and finding none. All day the great</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">blue circles glared at him unwinkingly,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">mockingly; he hated them; at night the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">blues were merely three shades darker and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">fired with incandescent planets, and he</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">loathed them. And day and night the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">merciless pulse of the surf beat like a swing-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ing pendulum in his brain. He could never</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">get beyond hearing of that sound. It was</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the very voice of the solitude. At mo-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">ments it seemed that he could endure no</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">more, and he would fling himself down and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">sob and curse in rage and loneliness.</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">and Coulson regained a little of his</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">first days was gone, and he found himself</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">sinking into a black melancholia. Never</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">had he been so conscious, with a strange</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">The wind in the palms seemed to murmur</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">threats or warnings. Sky and sea were full</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">of menace, and he watched the revolution</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">of the days with suspicion. He felt certain</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">that disastrous events of some sort were</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">about to take place, and his heart was filled</span>

                <ab>SYNOPSIS: Maldio, the progressive and beloved young ruler of the small European kingdom of Lambasa, is poisoned by Count Bistoff
                    at the orders of Maldio's stepmother, Queen Horatia, so that her own son, the puppet Gisdel, may rule. Bistoff, secretly loyal to
                    Maldio, only drugs him and later revives and rescues him from the tomb, along with Dugdale, an English secret agent, buried alive
                    for claiming Maldio was not really dead. Maldio, demanding a respite from kingly cares before claiming his throne, goes to England
                    and secretly marries Loti, the girl he loves, his identity being known only to her. Meanwhile Gisdel has become infatuated with
                    Caroline de L'Isle, ail actress, thereby enraging his mother. The Queen discovers the tomb is empty, suspects Bistoff and sends
                    Zavair to summon him. Bistoff makes excuses. Zavair reports having seen Dugdale alive at Bistoff's home.</ab>

                        <span type="columnLine">the safety of shooting into the herd. I paid</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">no attention to him, being too busy aiming</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">at a fine bull, but the Dutchman's nervous-</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">my aim was bad. The bull lifted his trunk</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">of violent death which is still vivid in my</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">memory. In desperation I threw myself</span>

                    <ab>
                        <span type="columnLine">Then I began to crawl. So heavy was the</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">sometimes happen. The wind favored me</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">back toward the herd. Rising, I pushed my</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">to swing again so that I could hit him in the</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">head. The bullet struck him in the flank,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">but only served to hasten him on his way.</span>
