                        <ab rend="block">Don't let the word "selling" scare you for it is remarkably easy for any man of average intelligence to become a first-class salesman. And then your future can be as big as you want to make it.</ab>

                    <div type="column">
                        <cb n="01"/>
                        <ab>THE majority of men are shackled down to poorly paid positions because they are either afraid to strike out for better things or they condemn themselves to a life of drudg- ery because of preconceived notions about what they can do.</ab>
                        <ab>Take salesmanship for instance. To the vast majority a salesman has to be "born" to his task. Nothing could be further from the truth; it is a vicious fallacy that has kept thousands of men from enjoying the good things enumerated in the panel above. Possibly, you, too,
                            think that selling is a "gift."</ab>
                        <ab>You cannot be blamed for what you think-- but you are utterly to blame if you do not investigate as to the soundness of your thoughts. For what you may think may be the thing that is tying you down to deadly routine and poor pay.</ab>
                        <ab>Proof That You Can Be a Master Salesman</ab>
                        <ab>During the past eighteen years the National Salesmen's Training Asociation has taken men from all walks of life and made them into producing salesmen. There's a state- ment you should investigate--but look at a few typical examples of the thousands of success stories in
                            our files and literature:</ab>
                        <ab>A. H. Ward, Chicago, earned better than $1,000 a month within one year after he com- pleted his training. Today he is an execu- tive of Postl's, Chicago. J. H. Cash, Atlanta, Ga., increased his earnings from $75 to $500 a month. F. M. Harris, a telegraph operator,
                            increased his earnings to $6,000 a year--and is now a Sales Manager. Warren Hartle, a railway mail clerk,</ab>

                    <div type="column">
                        <cb n="02"/>
                        <ab>stepped into the $10,000 a year class--so did O. H. Malfroot, of Boston, Mass.</ab>
                        <ab>You may think the foregoing are exception- al cases--but if you are seeking a real oppor- tunity you will withhold your thoughts until you get all the facts.</ab>
                        <ab>Why You Can Be Taught to Sell</ab>
                        <ab>You may think it remarkable that this Association can teach men at home during spare time to sell so quickly and easily. But there is nothing remarkable about it -- for Salesmanship is governed by fundamental rules and principles. There are certain ways to attract
                            attention, arouse interest and make prospects act--certain ways to overcome ob- jections, batter down prejudice, outwit compe- tition and get results. Once you know these secrets of master salesmanship you can dupli- cate any of the successes this remarkable System of
                            Salesmanship Training has been responsible for.</ab>
                        <ab>Exceptional Demand For Trained Salesmen</ab>
                        <ab>City and traveling sales positions are open in every line all over the country. For years thousands of leading concerns have called on the N.S.T.A. to supply them with salesmen. Employment service is free to both employers</ab>

                    <div type="column">

                        <ab>and members, and the fact that thousands have secured positions through this service is a glowing tribute to the thoroughness and practicability of our System of Salesmanship Training and Employment Service.</ab>
                        <ab>Send for Remarkable Book, "Modern Salesmanship" It Is Free</ab>
                        <ab>Naturally, you will want to investigate and find out for yourself what Salesmanship offers you, how it is taught by a method that gives you the equiva- lent of actual experience while studying, and wh[at] facilities are offered you by the Free Employme[nt] Bureau of the
                            Association. Just mail the coup[on] below and we will promptly mail you a free copy [of] "Modern Salesmanship" - the book that has start[ed] thousands on the road to bigger pay. There is no obligation.</ab>

                            <title>THE ABYSS</title>, by <persName>H. G. Wells</persName>. An explorer descends in a spherical shell down into depths never reached by any human being before. Here he finds fish- like human beings, and meets with a number of adven- tures that will keep up your
                            breathless interest for the entire length of the story. You must not miss it.</ab>

                            <title>THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE</title>, by <persName>Jules Verne</persName>, in which some enterprising mathematicians and scientists attempt to bring the North Pole to a temperate zone--or bring the temperate zone to the North Pole. A stroke of lightning sets
                            things flying in the mathematician's room and an error gets into the calculation. Of course, that upsets their plans consid- erably.</ab>

                            <title>THE MOON HOAX</title>, by <persName>Richard Adams Locke</persName>, is a classic scientifiction story containing excellent science along with some obvious mistakes, which were not de- tected even by a scientific audience. It is probably the greatest scientific hoax
                            that was ever perpetrated upon a credulous public. This was crowded out of the August issue.</ab>

                        <ab>Against an amazing background of mechanical, electrical and chem- ically altered life of mankind there is set a brilliant and colorful ro- mance in the life of the greatest living scientist 700 years hence.</ab>

                        everyday--not on desert islands, but in the chemical laboratories throughout your own country. Quietly, systematically, the chemist works. His work is difficult, but more adventurous than the blood- curdling deeds of the Spanish Main. Instead of meeting an early and violent
                        death on some forgotten shore, he gathers wealth and honor through his invaluable contributions to hu- manity. Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist who invented dynamite, made so many millions that the income alone from his bequests provides five $40,000 prizes every year for
                        the advancement of science and peace. C. M. Hall, the chemist who discovered how to manufacture aluminum made millions through this discovery. F. G. Cottrell, who devised a valu- able process for recovering the waste from flue gases, James Gayley, who showed how to save
                        enormous losses in steel manufacture, L. H. Baekeland, who invented Bakelite--these are only a few of the men to whom fortunes have come through their chemical achievements.</ab>
                    <ab>What Some of Our Students Say of This Course:</ab>
                    <ab>I have not written since I received the big set. I can still say that it far exceeded my anticipations. Since I have been studying with your school I have been appointed chemist for the Scranton Coal Co. testing all the coal and ash by proximate analysis. The lessons are
                        helping me wonderfully, and the interesting way in which they are written makes me wait patiently for each lesson.--MOBLIAS COUS- ENS.</ab>
                    <ab>I wish to express my appreciation of your prompt reply to my letter and to the recom- mendation to the General Electric Co. I in- tend to start the student engineering course [in] the works. This is somewhat along electrical lines, but the fact that I had a recommenda- tion
                        from a reliable school no doubt had con- siderable influence in helping me to secure the job.--H. VAN BENTITUREN.</ab>
                    <ab>So far I've been more than pleased with your course and [am still] doing nicely. I hope to be your honor graduate this year.--J. M. NORKUS, JR.</ab>
                    <ab>I find your course excellent and your instruc- tion, truthfully, the clearest and best assem- bled I have ever taken, and yours is the fifth one I've studied.--JAMES C. FELIX.</ab>
                    <ab>From the the I was having Chemistry it has never been thus explained to me as it is now. I am recommending you [regularly] to my friends, and [telling] them to become members of such an organization.--CHARLES BEN- JAMIN.</ab>
                    <ab>I shall always recommend your school to my friends and let them know how simple your les- sons are.--C. J. AMDAEL.</ab>
                    <ab>I am more than please. You dig right in from the start. I am going to get somewhere with this course. I am so glad that I found you.--A. A. CAMERON.</ab>
                    <ab>I use your lessons constantly as I find it more thorough that most test books I can secure.--W[ALTER TIBES].</ab>
                    <ab>Thanking you for your lessons, which I find not only clear and concise, but wonderfully interesting [to me].--ROBT. H. TEAYLOR</ab>
                    <ab>I received employment in the Consolidated Gas. Co. I appreciate very much the good service of the school when a recommendation was asked for.--JOS. DECKER.</ab>
                    <ab>Now Is the Time to Study Chemistry</ab>
                    <ab>Not only are there boundless opportunities for amassing wealth in Chemistry, but the profession affords congenial employment at good salaries to hundred of thousands who merely follow out its present applications. These appli- cations are innumerable, touching intimately
                        every business and every product in the world. The work of the chemist can hardly be called work at all. It is the keenest and most enjoyable kind of pleasure. The days in a chemical laboratory are filled with thrilling and delightful experimentation, with the alluring
                        prospect of a discovery that may spell Fortune always at hand to spur your enthusiasm.</ab>
                    <ab>You Can Learn at Home</ab>
                    <ab>To qualify for this remarkable calling requires elaborate specialized training. Fomerly it was necessary to attend a university for several years to acquire that training, but thanks to our highly perfected and thorough system of instruction, you can now stay at home, keep
                        your position, and let us educate you in Chemistry during your spare time. Even with only common schooling you can take our course and equip yourself for immediate practical work in a chemical laboratory. Dr. Sloane give every one of his students the same careful, personal
                        superv- vision that made him celebrated throughout his long career as a college professor. Your instruction from the very beginning is made interesting and practical, and we supply you with apparatus and chemicals for performing the fascinating analyses and experimental work
                        that plays such a large part in our method of teaching, and you are awarded the Institute's official diploma after you have satisfactorily completed the course.</ab>
                    <ab>Experimental Equipment Furnish to Every Student</ab>
                    <ab>We give to every student without additional charge this chemical equipment, including forty-nine pieces of labora- tory apparatus and supplies, and forty different chemicals and reagents. These comprise the apparatus and chemicals used for the experimental work of the course.
                        The fitted heavy wooden box serves not only as a case for the outfit but also as a useful laboratory accessory for performing countless experiments.</ab>
                    <ab>Easy Monthly Payments</ab>
                    <ab>You don't have to have even the small price of the course to start. You can pay for it in small monthly amounts - so small that you won't feel them. The cost of our course is very low, and inlcudes everything, even the chemistry outfit - there are no extras to buy with our
                        course. Our plan of monthly payments places a chemical education within the reach of everyone. Write us and let us explain our plan in full - give us the opportunity of showing you how you can qualify for a highly trained technical position without even giving up your present
                        employment.</ab>
                    <ab>Special 30 Day Offer</ab>
