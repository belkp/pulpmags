                    <ab>SYNOPSIS: Sir John Hawkwood, the famous English mercenary, at the time of this story in the service of Della Scala, Prince of Verona, boldly refuses to kidnap the Prince's ward
                        and cousin, the Princess Giulia, and allow the Prince to make a pretended rescue for the purpose of furthering his love-suit. Hawkwood and his lieutenant, O'Meara (in love with
                        the Princess's friend, Francesca di Montalto), fear a treacherous revenge; Hawkwood overhears a plot of the Prince's favorite, Della Torre, and his wife Violante, to undo him
                        by a false charge of treachery. He attempts to warn Giulia, but she repulses him with scorn for his low birth and riotous life. He forcibly retains her scarf to wear as his
                        colors in battle. Ashamed of his past life and regardless of his own great danger, Sir John forestalls Potrero, the Prince's henchman, and himself carries off the Princess, her
                        uncle Del Mayno, and Francesca to a deserted castle. Del Mayno is released. Sir John plans to hold the castle against the Prince till aid comes from Florence enabling him to
                        send the Princess to her kinsman, the Duke of Padua. The Princess regards him as a mercenary cut- throat and even attempts to stab him.</ab>
