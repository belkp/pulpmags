                        Grow New Hair.</ab>
                    <ab>(Read Free Offer)</ab>
                    <ab>A germ called "Flask Bacilla of Unna" gets deep into the scalp skin in many
                        cases of abnormal hair deficiency, causing a most dangerous type of
                        dandruff. It clogs up pores and hair follicles, causing itchy scalp, falling
                        hair and prevents dormant hair roots (papilla) from growing new hair. The
                        germ is seldom suspected. Washing and shampooing and use of tonics,
                        ointments and lotions don't remove the cause. They merely cleanse and treat
                        the surface and roll off the outer skin like water rolls off the back of
                        duck. No wonder baldness is increasing.</ab>
                    <ab>Now a new discovery enables people who have dandruff, falling hair, thin
                        hair and baldness to harmlessly romove the congested, thin outer layer of
                        scalp skin. This permits opened pores to breathe in air, sunshine and absorb
                        a penetrating, stimulating scalp-food to activate the smothered, dormant
                        hair roots and grow new hair. It is the most sensational discovery in the
                        history of falling hair and baldness. It is all explained in a new treatise
                        called "GROW HAIR," showing "anatomy of your hair" and tells what to do.
                        This treatise is now being mailed FREE to all who write for it. Send no

                    <ab>Kelp-a-Malt, only recently discovered, is an amazingly rich source of food
                        iodine, along with practically every mineral essential to normal well-being.
                        It is a sea vegeta-ble concentrate taken from the Pacific Ocean and made
                        available in palatable, pleasant-to-take tablet form. Six Kelp-a-Malt tab-
                        lets provide more food iodine than 486 pounds of spinach, 1,600 pounds of
                        beef, 1,387 pounds of lettuce. Three Kelp-a-Malt tablets contain more iron
                        and copper for rich blood, vitality and strength than a pound of spinach, 7
                        1/2 pounds of fresh to- matoes more calcium than 6 eggs, more phosphorous
                        than a pound and a half of car- rots sulphur, sodium, potassium and other
                        essential minerals.</ab>
                    <ab>Only when you get an adequate amount of these minerals can your food do you
                        any good- can you nourish glands, add weight, strengthen your nerves,
                        increase your vigor, vitality and endurance.</ab>

                        <ab>The Japanese Umbrella Palm is a semi-aquatic plant. It is easily grown
                            from seed either in a bowl of water or in very damp soil. Probably the
                            most usual, as well as the most interesting method, is to cultivate the
                            plant in a bowl or jardiniere filled with water, with two or threo
                            inches of good garden soil at the bottom. The needs soon commence to
                            germinate, and the plant shoots up stems two to three feet high and
                            rapidly assumes a most pretty palm-like appearance, as shown in the
                            engraving. The tops of the stems are surmounted by a whorl of
                            um-brella-shaped leaves, of a waxy appearance. We will send a package of
                            this seed, with full instructions for culture, for only 15c or three

                    <ab>You have 9 million tiny tubes or filters in your Kidneys, which are at work
                        night and day cleaning out Acids and poisonous wastes and purifying your
                        blood, which circulates thorugh your kidneys 200 times an hour. So it's no
                        wonder that poorly functioning Kidneys may be the real cause of feeling
                        tired, run-down, nervous, Get- ting Up Nights, Rheumatic Pains and other
                        troubles.</ab>
                    <ab>Nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poorly functioning Kidneys at times
                        because modern foods and drinks, weather changes, exposure, colds, nervous
                        strain, worry and over-work often place an extra heavy load on the
                        Kidneys.</ab>
                    <ab>But when your Kidneys need help, don't take chances with drastic or
                        irritating drugs. Be careful. If poorly functioning Kidneys or Bladder make
                        you suffer from Getting Up Nights, Leg Pains, Nervousness, Stiffness,

                    <ab>City Health Doctor Praises Cystex</ab>
                    <ab>Doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the prescription Cystex because
                        of its splendid ingredients and quick action. For instance. Dr. W. R.
                        George, graduate Med- ical Dept., University of Indiana, former Health
                        Commissioner or Indianapolis, and Med- ical Director for insur- ance company
                        10 years, recently wrote the fol- lowing letter: "There is little ques- tion
                        but what properly functioning Kidney and Bladder organs are vital to the
                        health. Insuf- ficient Kidney excre- tions are the cause of much needless
                        suffering with aching back, weak- ness, painful joints and rheumatic pains,
                        headaches and a general run-down, ex- hausted body. This condition also in-
                        terferes with normal rest at night by caus- ing the sufferer to rise
                        frequently for relief, and results in painful excretion, itching, smarting
                        and burning. I am of the opinion that Cystex definitely corrects frequent
                        causes (poor kidney functions) of such con- ditions and I have actually
                        prescribed in my own practice for many years past the same ingredients
                        contained in your formula. Cys- tex not only exerts a splendid influence in
                        flushing poisons from the urinary tract, but also has an antiseptic action
                        and assists in freeing the blood or retained toxins. Be- lieving as I do
                        that so meritorious a prod- uct deserves the endorsement of the Medical
                        Profession, I am happy indeed to lend my name and photograph for your use in
                        adver-tising Cystex." Signed W. R. George, M. D.</ab>

                    <ab>It's Easy MY WAY</ab>
                    <ab>Big claims mean nothing! That is why I offer you more than promis[e]s. That
                        is why I offer you a 7 days trial of my famous method. Dynamic-Tension. That
                        lets you see for yourself that I back up every promise I make. That PROVES
                        beyond a flicker of a doubt that I can and will turn you, too, into a vital,
                        powerful NEW MAN.</ab>
                    <ab>Thousands of fellows all over The world have used my method- and now you
                        can, too. Like them, you can put on firm layers of muscle where you need
                        them most, tone up your whole system, banish consti- pation, poor digestion,
                        bad breath, pimples and other conditions that rob you of the good things and
                        good times of life, and get the "drive" that'll take you to the top of the
                        ladder.</ab>
                    <ab>I've Got NO USE for Apparatus</ab>
                    <ab>I haven't any use for tricky weights or pulleys and machines that may strain
                        your heart and other vital or-gans. There's nothing unnatural or artificial
                        about this method of mine. And I don't dose you or doctor you.
                        Dynamic-Tension is all I need. It's the natural, tested method for
                        developing real men inside and out. It distributes added pounds of powerful
                        muscles over your body, gets rid of ailments and surplus fat and gives you
                        the vitality, strength and pep that win you the admiration of every woman
                        and the respect of any man.</ab>
