                        old diamond banking house, rated at more than $1,000,000.00 has been making
                        additional thousands of loans on high grade jewels. Hence we have many
                        unpaid loans which we offer to sell at once away below market prices.</ab>

                        not duplicate for less than $162.00." Hundreds of letters like these. Names
                        on request.</ab>

                            face and form quickly. </ab>
                        <ab>This clever woman has not a wrinkle upon her face; she has per- fected a
                            marvelous, simple method which brought a wonderful change in her face in
                            a single night. For removing wrinkles and develop-ing the figure, her
                            method is truly wonderfully rapid.</ab>
                        <ab>She made herself the woman she is today and brought about the wonderful
                            change in her appearance in a secret and pleasant manner. Her complexion
                            is as clear and fair as that of a child. She turned her scrawny figure
                            into a beautiful and well-developed form. She had thin, scrawny
                            eye-lashes and eyebrows, which could scarcely be seen, and she made them
                            long, thick and beautiful by her own methods and re- moved every
                            blackhead and pimple from her face in a single night.</ab>
                        <ab>Nothing is taken into the stomach, no common massage, no harm-ful
                            plasters, no worthless creams.</ab>
                        <ab>By her new process, she removes wrinkles and develops the whole figure
                            plump and fat.</ab>

                            beautifying their face and form after beauty doctors and other methods
                            failed. She has thousands of letters on file like the following:</ab>
                        <ab>Mrs. M. L. B. Albin, Miss., writes: "I have used your beauty treatment
                            with wonderful success. I have not a wrinkle on my face now and it is
                            also improving my complexion, which has al-ways troubled me with pimples
                            and blackheads. My weight was 112 pounds before taking your treatment
                            and now I weigh 117, a gain of 5 pounds. Your treatment is a God send to
                            all thin women. I am so grateful you may even use my letter if you

                        <ab>And you will not be satisfied unless you earn steady pro- motion. But
                            are you prepared for the job ahead of you? Do you measure up to the
                            standard that insures success? For a more responsible position a fairly
                            good education is necessary. To write a sensible business letter, to
                            prepare estimates, to figure cost and to compute interest, you must have
                            a certain amount of preparation. All this you must be able to do before
                            you will earn promotion, Many business houses hire no men whose general
                            know-ledge is not equal to a high school course. Why? Because big
                            business refuses to burden itself with men who are barred from promotion
                            by the lack of elementary education.</ab>

                            prepare you to hold your own where competition is keen and exacting. Do
                            not doubt your abili-ty, but make up your mind to it and you will soon
                            have the requirements that will bring you success and big money. YOU CAN

                    <ab>SEND NO MONEY. Just send us your name and address and we will send you,
                        prepaid, on approval, a genuine Lachnite Gem, mounted in a solid gold ring.
                        Wear it ten full days. These sparkling gems have the eternal fire of
                        diamonds. Their brilliance and hardness are guaranteed forever. We wish you
                        to select a ring from this advertisement and wear it ten full days at our
                        expense. Then, if you can tell it from a diamond, send it back. One hundred
                        thousand people are now wearing brilliant Lachnite Gems. These people have
                        proved they could not tell Lachnites from diamonds.</ab>
                    <ab>Pay As You Wish</ab>
                    <ab>When the ring comes just make the first small deposit ($4.75) with the
                        postman. This is only a deposit. It is not a payment. The money is still
                        yours. Put the ring on your finger and wear it everywhere for ten full days.
                        Then, if you decide to keep it, pay the balance at the rate of $2.50 a month
                        until $18.75 has been paid. But if, during the trial, you decide to send the
                        Lachnite back, your deposit will be refunded instantly. You run no risk. The
                        total price is only $18.75 for either ring.</ab>
