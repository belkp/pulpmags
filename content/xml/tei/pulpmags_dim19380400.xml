                    <ab>"A second later a rattler cut the mountain stillness. He sounded like a machine gun, he was so close...and, as I lay motionless, scarcely daring to breathe, I felt his lethal
                        slithering body cross my own!.. .Then other rattles sounded all around us!</ab>

                    <ab>"But before he could strike, my wife diverted the snake's attention with the flash-light beam. I leapt to my feet, so did she, throwing the light at the six-foot intruder.</ab>
                    <lb/>
                    <ab>"We fled through the dark woods while the rattlers gathered on the rock to strike at the light that saved us, a light powered with DATEO 'Eveready' batteries that were really
                        fresh when we bought them months before.</ab>

                        <ab>Here's one good way to flush harmful waste from kidneys and stop bladder irritation that often causes scanty, burning and smarting passage. Ask your druggist for a 85-cent
                            box of Gold Medal Haarlem Oil Capsules--a splen-did safe and harmless diuretic and stimulant for weak kidneys and irritated bladder. Besides getting up nights, some
                            symptoms of kidney trouble are backaches, puffy eyes, leg cramps, and moist palms, but be sure to get GOLD MEDAL--it's the genuine medicine for weak kidneys--right from
                            Haarlem in Holland.</ab>

                    <ab>Are Camels Really different from other Cigarettes?</ab>
                    <ab>A QUESTION OF INTEREST TO EVERY SMOKER</ab>
                    <ab>"I've never been very fussy about cigarettes myself. Do you think that Camels are really as different as some people say, Bill?"</ab>
                    <ab>"You bet, John! A fellow in any work a hard as selling has to figure out lot of angles on smoking, such as how it agrees with him. And just notice how many sales-men smoke
                        Camels. I changed to Camels and found a distinct difference in the way I enjoyed smoking. Camels agree with me!"</ab>
                    <ab>...H. W. DALY, 34, rayon salesman, and millions of other steady smokers say: "Camels are really different." Camels are preferred by the largest body of smokers ever known.</ab>
                    <ab>A KISS FROM MARITA (Mrs. Daly) and Bill is off to his job. The Dalys agree about Camels. Mrs. Daly smoked them first." Now it's Camels with both of us," she says.</ab>
                    <ab>A FRIEND DROPS IN. Daly passes the Camels and answers a question: "Steady smoking is the test that shows Camels in a class by themselves. Camels don't make my nerves
                        'edgy.'"</ab>
                    <ab>MARITA'S PLANNING a grand feed. "We enjoy entertaining," she says. "I like plenty of Camels at the table. Camels cheer up one's digestion. They even cheered up Bill's
                        disposition."</ab>
                    <ab>ON WEEK-ENDS, Bill's a camera fan. On week days he "pounds the streets." "When I get tired," he says, "I get a quick 'lift' with a Camel."</ab>
