                              <ab>Thousands turn to Listerine as science proves it CURES DANDRUFF</ab>
                              <ab>Clinical evidence that Listerine Antiseptic kills queer Pityrosporum ovale germ, that causes dandruff, starts wave
                                    of home treatments . . . letters pour in telling of rapid, complete cures</ab>
                              <ab>IT IS WONDERFUL HOW LISTERINE STOPS THAT AWFUL SCALING, ITCHING AND BURNING</ab>
                              <ab>Ever since the amazing dandruff cures accomplished with Listerine became a matter of clinical record, thousands of
                                    dandruff sufferers throughout the country have swung over to Listerine for quick, effective relief. Many of them
                                    write to us, fervently praising Listerine for what it has done for them.</ab>
                              <ab>Here are a few random excerpts from the hundreds of grateful letters that reach us:</ab>
                              <ab>"Have been using Listerine for only two weeks. Already feel wonderfully relieved from the horrible itchy
                                    feeling."</ab>
                              <ab>"Two weeks after first using it my dandruff was gone."</ab>
                              <ab>"Tried Listerine for 21 days and ran find no trace of dandruff now."</ab>
                              <ab>"Tried everything possible, until one day I used Lister- ine. The itching stopped at once. My hair has stopped
                                    falling out."</ab>
                              <ab>Kills the Germ</ab>
                              <ab>In the sensational research that established the Pityrosporum ovale germ as the cause of dandruff, it was positively
                                    proved that Listerine kills the germ.</ab>
                              <ab>When a mid-western skin clinic instructed dan- druff patients to use the daily Listerine Treatment, a substantial
                                    number obtained marked relief within the first two weeks on the average.</ab>
                              <ab>76% of a group of dandruff sufferers at a New Jersey Clinic, who used the Listerine treatment twice daily, showed
                                    complete disappearance of, or marked improvement in, the symptoms within thirty days.</ab>
                              <ab>Start Treatment Today</ab>
                              <ab>Don't waste time on ordinary remedies that merely wash away dandruff symptoms temporarily. Start ridding your scalp
                                    of the dandruff germ with Lis- terine today.</ab>
                              <ab>And remember, like any other germ disease, dan- druff is a stubborn malady requiring persistent treatment. Even
                                    after it has been cured, it is wise to guard against re-infection by occasional Listerine Antiseptic massages at
                                    regular intervals.</ab>

                              <ab>THE TREATMENT</ab>
                              <ab>Once or twice a day, use full strength Lis- terine on the scalp, spreading it with fingers, or parting the hair and
                                    applying with cotton or eye dropper.</ab>
                              <ab>Now massage scalp vigorously and per- sistently with fingertips; active stimulation of the scalp is highly important
                                    in dandruff treatment.</ab>
                              <ab>If scalp is excessively dry, use a little olive oil in conjunction with Lis- terine. Listerine will not bleach the
                                    hair.</ab>
                              <ab>P. S. Listerine, which has been discovered to be such an excellent germicidal treatment for dandruff, is the same
                                    Listerine Antiseptic which has been used as a mouth wash and gargle for years.</ab>

                                    that he has been listening to a conversation within himselfâ€”an eloquent appeal to self from some intangible in-
                                    telligence? Who has not had that tenseness, that sensation of a suppressed excitement, as though some power were
                                    seeking to manifest through him? Too long have the restrictions of ortho- doxy and the ridicule of unenlightened
                                    persons kept these common-place occurrences shrouded in sccrecy. Millions now admit the existence of an intimate

                                    His so-called Miracles," is attracting world- wide attention to its founder, Dr. Frank B. Robinson, noted
                                    Psychologist, author and lec- turer.</ab>
                              <ab>"Psychiana," this new psychological religion, believes and teaches that it is today possible for every normal human
                                    being, understanding spiritual law as Christ understood it, "to du- plicate every work that the Carpenter of
                                    Galilee ever did"â€”it believes and teaches that when He said, "the things that I do shall ye do also." He meant
                                    what He said and meant it literally to all mankind, through all the ages.</ab>
                              <ab>Dr. Robinson has prepared a 6,000 word treatise on "Psychiana," in which he tells about his long search for the
                                    Truth, how he finally came to the full realization of an Unseen Power or force "so dynamic in itself that all
                                    other powers and forces fade into insignificance be- side it"â€”how he learned to commune directly with the Living
                                    God, using this mighty, never- failing power to demonstrate health, happiness and financial success and how any
                                    normal being may find and use it as Jesus did. He is now offering this treatise free to every reader of this
                                    magazine who writes him.</ab>

                                    the roads of Death,<lb/> And I have seen black valleys gape, abysses in the gloom,<lb/> And I have fought the

                                    burgher Pieter van Werff, whose son is shortly to be married to Lysbeth van de Doren, and shows us how that heroic
                                    girl accepted shame and disgrace to save those she loved, only to be betrayed by them. Through sev- eral lives
                                    runs the story, until the young van Werff at last gets the chance to atone for his treachery. This ro- mantic and

                              <ab>COMING NEXT MONTH</ab>
                              <ab>THE GREAT CHAPEL, circular in shape, had walls that rose curving, darkly luminous, satin-smooth as the petals of a
                                    vast black tulip, to meet a vaulted roofâ€”their polished surface broken by squat archways behind which darkness lay
                                    like a crouching beast of prey.</ab>
                              <ab>Above the huge slab of the altar-stone was a reredos of red alabaster, a screen some thirty feet by ten. It was
                                    powerfully illumined from behind, so that its carving stood out in bold relief and a trick in the lighting gave a
                                    sinister effect of constant movement.</ab>
                              <ab>This screen was a vivid presentment of a human sacrifice. Bound on the stone altar, a woman appeared to writhe and
                                    quiver. Her long bright hair rippled down to a deep trough about the altar-base. About the altar stood tall
                                    candles whose flames danced in frenzy. And behind the candles' flare and flicker, at each of the four corners of
                                    the altar, a veiled figure towered. Menacing, gigantic, these figures were the only immovable objects on the
                                    screen, and they achieved by their fateful stillnessâ€”in contrast with the surge and movement of all else in the
                                    pictureâ€”an effect of final inescapable doom. Dark crescent moons poised above each veiled head of these four
                                    attendant genii, bearing Hebrew characters which readâ€” EARTH. WINTER. NIGHT. DEATH.</ab>
                              <ab>And now Sant saw the black-clad figureâ€”the body of Stephen Lynn, torn and wrenched, trembling from head to foot in
                                    diabolic ecstasy, arms flung wide, head bent backward so that light from the suspended globe beat full and
                                    fiercely down upon the upturned face. Louderâ€”louder rang the great triumphant organ voice, pealing out into the
                                    unclean silence of the chapel's gloom, beating against the curved and shining walls which sent back clashing
                                    paeans of tremendous harmony. . . .</ab>

                              <ab>RIPLEY'S EXPLANATION: 26 Mile Knee Crawl Over Untreated Concrete! The world's longest foot-race is the Olympic
                                    Marathon- 26 miles, 385 yards. Tom Boyd went the distance on his knees, over untreated con- crete, wearing
                                    unprotected Lee Jelt Denim Overalls, every step supervised by a Certified Public Account- ant. He had to quit
                                    once, because the skin on his knees wore out! The "C. P. A." sent me the certified report and the Lee Overalls.
                                    The denim looks as if it had miles of grueling wear left in it. The strong multiple-twist yarn puts amazing
                                    strength in this genuine Jelt Denim for the toughest job.</ab>

                                    Denim! 249,516 steps alto- gether! The Jelt Denim, while showing some wear, didn't have a hole or a break, still
                                    held its blue color! Here's amazing proof of Lee Overalls extra wear for your moneyâ€”Believe It Or Not!</ab>
