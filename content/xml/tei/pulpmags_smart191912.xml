                                    <ab>Beauty is the most precious possession a woman may attain. All the arts, crafts, and science in the world's
                                          history have centered around the subject. Deep thinkers and men of genius have dignified feminine beauty
                                          with their comments. Poets have sung its praises, musicians have set it to melody, literarture has painted
                                          it in word pictures, sculptors have carved it in marble, and painters immortalized it in color Lives have
                                          been sacrified, wars waged and kingdoms lost and won- all for a woman's beauty.</ab>

                                    only Three bags and a box And hopes of a quarter When I tell them that last night, By the black water, By the dark
                                    blue water, Under a tree that bent over us As trees bend over lovers In the meadows of heaven, Your hands learned
                                    my face And your mouth my mouth, And afire with a new knowledge Our eyes shone through the darkness Like four
                                    stars.</ab>
                              <ab>Ah, they will notice me, those men, And touch their caps, And say, "Good morning." And I will answer them As a man
                                    should Who has been touched with ecstasy.</ab>
                              <ab>But I shall not tell the little blonde waitress Who served me my breakfast, For I think she, Wise maiden, Has

                              <ab>As you remember the story, Jack began to climb at once the beanstalk that had grown so suddenly from this world to
                                    another. But the story does not tell how Jack, becoming a little tired half-way tip the stalk, lay down to rest on
                                    a leaf rather broader than the others. The stage where this scene is played is on that leaf, and one may see from
                                    the audience still others leading upward and down- ward in a gigantic green circular stairway, the thick heavy
                                    stalk rising rigid through the center.</ab>
                              <ab>As the curtain lifts, Jack comes about the turn of the stalk. He wears a grey and scarlet gherkin, an impudent cap,
                                    and carries a staff of heavy oak. He pauses a moment and appraises this resting-place, then peers down around the
                                    stalk whence he has come.</ab>

                              <ab>THERE was a woman in the hospital today— One of the kind with satin slippers and Ideal perfume; And she thought we
                                    were "wonderful" and "truly angels of mercy." She would "just love to be a nurse." And now I am wondering— I am
                                    wondering just how much she would love Those three years of training; The long weeks of night duty With the
                                    terrible feeling about three o'clock in the morning That you must sleep or die. The worry on tonsil night for fear
                                    some youngster may hemorrhage. The Hamburg steak and poor coffee at midnight supper; The getting up during the day
                                    for lectures. And the out-patient service where you go down into the slums To help some Italian or Polish woman
                                    have her baby. And the operating room where you stand for hours on a tiled floor And serve an exacting surgeon—
                                    And then polish the instruments and wash bloodsoaked linen. And, after graduating, the living in a suitcase, With
                                    the constant companionship of a sick person—day and night. And men taking the attitude of "but I can tell you"—
                                    "You understand things of that sort." I am wondering just how much she would love it.</ab>

                                    trees of solitude. He saw the stars just over the horizon, And they seemed to grow On trees that he could reach.
                                    So he scampered on, from branch to branch, Wondering why the fairy nut-trees Ran away from him. But, looking down,
                                    he spied. A softly wild-cheeked mountain pool, And there a handful of fairy nuts Bit into the indigo cupping them.
                                    With a squeal of weary happiness The squirrel plunged into the mountain pool, And as he drowned within its
                                    soundless heart The fairy nuts were jigging over him Like the unheard stirring of a poem.</ab>

                              <ab>THE moving picture industry is facing a famine — a famine in story plots — photoplays. Higher prices than ever
                                    before — $500 to $1000 are being paid for 5-reel dramatic scripts; $100 to $500 for clever short comedies. For the
                                    studios—around Los Angeles alone — need approximately 3000 new stories each year. Producers must have material —
                                    new plots, especially written for the screen.</ab>
                              <ab>And now a plan — the first to be endorsed by the leading stars and producers — has been designed to teach you how to
                                    prepare your ideas for the screen. The plan was created by Frederick Palmer, for- merly of Universal — the man who
                                    wrote 52 scenarios in 9 months — more than one a week—all accepted. Mr. Palmer furnishes you with a handbook and
                                    cross references to scenarios that have been PRO- DUCED. Both drama and comedy are represented. Since we started a
                                    little over a year ago, many of our students have sold their plays, some for as high as $1000. A number of others
                                    have already taken posi- tions at the studios.</ab>
