                              <ab>AT THE core of the strange garden, where a circular space was still vacant amid the crowding growths, Adompha came
                                    to a mound of loamy, fresh-dug earth. Beside it, wholly nude, and pale and supine as if in death, there lay the
                                    odalisque Thulo- neah. Near her, various knives and other implements, together with vials of liquid balsams and
                                    viscid gums that Dwerulas used in his grafting, had been emptied upon the ground from a leathern bag. A plant
                                    known as the dedaim, with a bulbous, pulpy, whitish-green bole from whose center rose and radiated several
                                    leafless reptilian boughs, dripped upon Thulo- neah's bosom an occasional drop of yellowish-red ichor from
                                    incisions made in its smooth bark.</ab>
                              <ab>Behind the loamy mound, Dwerulas rose to view with the suddenness of a demon emerging from his subterrene lair. In
                                    his hands he held the spade with which he had just finished digging a deep and grave-like hole. Beside the regal
                                    stature and girth of Adompha, he seemed no more than a wizened dwarf. His aspect bore all the marks of immense
                                    age, as if dusty centuries had sered his flesh and sucked the blood from his veins. His eyes glowed in the bottom
                                    of pit-like orbits; his features were black and sunken as those of a long-dead corpse; his body was gnarled as
                                    some millennial desert cedar. He stooped incessantly, so that his lank, knotty arms hung almost to the ground.
                                    Adompha marveled at the strength of those arms; marveled that Dwerulas could have wielded the heavy shovel so
                                    expeditious- ly, could have carried to the garden on his back the burden of those victims whose members he had
                                    utilized in his experiments. The king had never demeaned himself to assist at such labors; but, after indicating
                                    from time to time the people whose disappearance would in no wise displease him, had done nothing more than watch
                                    and supervise the baroque gardening.</ab>
                              <ab>"Is she dead?" Adompha questioned, eyeing the luxurious limbs and body of Thuloneah without emotion.</ab>
                              <ab>"Nay," said Dwerulas. in a voice harsh as a rusty coffin-hinge, "but I have administered to her the drowsy and
                                    overpowering juice of the dedaim. Her heart beats impalpably, her blood flows with the sluggishness of that
                                    mingled ichor. She will not reawaken . . . save as a part of the garden's life, sharing its obscure sentience. I
                                    wait now your further in- structions. What portion . . . or portions?"</ab>
                              <ab>"Her hands were very deft," said Adompha, as if musing aloud, in reply to the half- uttered question. "They knew the
                                    subtle ways of love and were learned in all amorous arts. I would have you preserve her hands . . . but nothing
                                    else." . . .</ab>
                              <ab>A strange story indeed is this, written in the magic words of one of the greatest living masters of weird fiction.
                                    What happened to Thuloneah when her arms were grafted to the dedaim tree makes a fascinating and unusual weird
                                    story of immense interest and power. It will be printed complete in the April issue of Weird Tales:</ab>
