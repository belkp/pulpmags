                        <ab>-give yourself a chance</ab>
                        <ab>A few trained exporters are at present controlling the American total of foreign orders, because they alone know how to
                            export American goods. As a result, they are getting what all trained specialists deserve to get—big money and big
                            jobs.</ab>
                        <ab>The man who knows how to handle an export order is the man thousands of American manufacturers are clamoring for. The day
                            of the trained export man is to-day. It is right here. Now. Right before your eyes, as you read this sen-tence.</ab>
                        <ab>In the unsentimental choosing by big producers of men to increase profit, those with simply domestic experience are being
                            passed by. Big industry is hook-ing up to the man who can help it in putting over its big foreign deals. It de-mands the
                            specialist.</ab>
                        <ab>You always will have to offer something special to step ahead in business. Can you think of anything to offer more timely
                            than a trained ability to handle foreign orders with success?</ab>
                        <ab>Because you will hardly think of any-thing more profitable, give yourself a chance to make good by sending for our
                            booklet, The New Foreign Trade, which tells you how to begin training</ab>

                    <ab>LIST, little maid, with the eager feet And the tender eyes of blue, Laugh while the world seems glad and sweet Sing while you
                        think it true. Gather roses and lilies fair, Dance with the dancing streams, Keep your heart while you can from care, Youth is
                        the time for dreams.</ab>
                    <ab>List, little maid, with the waving hands And the plaited, golden hair, One in the wide world understands All that you do and
                        dare. One is glad for your eager heart And your smile that ever gleams, Yours is of life the golden part, Youth is the time
                        for dreams.</ab>
                    <ab>List, little maid, with the faith sublime, And the trust that angels know, Griefs may lie in the lap of Time And your bounding
                        step grow slow. But one who wearies of stress and strife And of joy not all it seems, Is glad, from the depths of his jaded
                        life, That youth is the time for dreams.</ab>

                        <title>Love Laughs at Locksmiths, But—</title>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>ONCE upon a time, before the High Cost of Living raised its hydra-headed menace in the land, there lived a youth and a maiden
                        named respectively Jack and Jill. In the Theatre of Life, they listened to the clever patter of the little vaude- villain
                        billed as Love, and fell for his stuff. So they were married, and all was as merry as the wedding bells until one day Poverty
                        came in at the door. The door was locked, but that made no difference to Poverty. He came in just the same. By way of a joke,
                        Love jumped through the window. Poverty took possession of the spare room and proceeded to make himself at home.</ab>
                    <ab>Jack and Jill 'phoned for the Locksmith to come and repair the damage. The Locksmith came with his kit of tools, but, catching
                        a glimpse of Poverty in the spare room, demanded his pay in advance. Whereupon Love stuck his head in the window and burst
                        into roars of laughter.</ab>
                    <ab>"Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho! ho!" cried Love. "If there's anybody that can get a laugh out of me, it's a Locksmith. He's funnier than
                        I am."</ab>
                    <ab>Jack and Jill were overjoyed to see the Locksmith slink away, nor did they know he had merely gone to fetch his gang. But that
                        is just what the miserable gangster did. Presently he returned, reinforced by the Butcher, the Baker and the Candle- stick
                        Maker, all armed with cruel weapons known as Bills. Using these horrible instruments of torture to extract their nefarious
                        toll from Jack and Jill, they beat Love to an unrecognizable pulp while Poverty stood outside to stall off any possible police
                        interference, thus making the world safe for Democracy. Then they all went away to report to their master, the High Cost of
                        Living, making the well-known welkin ring with the peals of raucous mirth.</ab>
                    <ab>MORAL</ab>
                    <ab>Love laughs at locksmiths, but—He laughs best who laughs last. THE lure of the unattainable is what makes life worth while.
                        After a man's search is rewarded by finding the ideal woman, she passes him up because she is looking for the ideal man.</ab>
                    <ab>THERE is nothing so beautiful as sympathy. A woman always feels sorry for a man who has trouble with his wife, unless she
                        happens to be his wife.</ab>

                    <ab>AN ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If there were no marriages, there would be no divorces.</ab>
                    <ab>Sweet are the uses of adversity, but adversity, like olives, may be an acquired taste.</ab>
                    <ab>Happiness comes from mating with our opposites; but did you ever hear of a beardless youth marrying a girl with a hare
                        lip?</ab>

                    <ab>Men are but children of a larger growth. When our parents cease spanking us, experience begins.</ab>
                    <ab>A soft answer turneth away wrath, but that is no reason why you shouldn't take boxing lessons.</ab>
                    <ab>Virtue is its own reward, and most of us go through life unrewarded. Love is blind. It causes two people to think almost as
                        much of each other as they do of themselves.</ab>
                    <ab>There is nothing new under the sun. Even our mistakes have been made before.</ab>
                    <ab>It is possible to reach a man's heart through his stomach; but that sort of man would rather lost his heart than his

                        An aviator thrills me with bliss. A man who can nonchalantly go to a dentist commands my admiration. Even a married man
                        inspires my respect.</ab>
                    <ab>Consequently, when the circus manager volunteered to conduct me through his realms of romance and mystery, my love of heroic
                        deeds prompted me to accept. First he pointed out his celebrities.</ab>
                    <ab>"There is Signor Scario, my lion tamer," he announced.</ab>
                    <ab>I regret to say that Signor Scario scarcely looked the part. He seemed decidedly anemic. "Still, you never can tell," I mused.
                        "He must be possessed of great courage."</ab>
                    <ab>"To-night he has decided to sleep in the cage with his lions," said my host.</ab>
                    <ab>"Ah! What a brave man," I exclaimed.</ab>
                    <ab>"Oh, I don't know," replied the circus manager. "He has had a scrap with his wife and he's afraid to go home."</ab>

                    <ab>For in the west, the world seemed turned to red, And then a smear of yellow overcast The sky; and as the color quickly spread,
                        Brought visions of my early morn's repast; And all the scene recalled, as from the dead, The weary egg with which I broke my

                        friendship. There is something mysterious about Longfield, and Keene's suspicions are aroused. Keene is in San Francisco in
                        search of a clue to the scene of his fight with the Malays. The wounds he received in that encounter have wiped from his mind
                        all memory of the location of the spot at which he had buried a treasure, brought, through great dangers, from Asia to

                        a land Of boundless vistas, looking toward the sea— A place with no engirdling walls on either hand To hem love in, nor make

                    <ab>THERE was once a man who lived in a valley—a pretty valley, but there was no creek in it, and the man was lonely for the sound
                        of running water. Then the man said:</ab>
                    <ab>"I shall go up to the top of the hill and dig a well and draw water therefrom and pour it onto the hillside so it will run
                        down and form a creek in my valley."</ab>
                    <ab>And he did so.</ab>
                    <ab>Very soon a little stream went leaping and shouting down the hill, and clapped its hands at sight of the pretty valley and
                        crooned, softly, to itself.</ab>
                    <ab>The man saw and heard and was greatly pleased. Then he said: "Now, I shall go down into my valley and enjoy the rivulet I have
                        made."</ab>
                    <ab>And he went down. When he had descended and stood in the valley the stream had disappeared.</ab>
                    <ab>He forgot, you see, that the stream was of his making, and could last only while he drew water from the well and poured it out

                    <ab>You say he was a very foolish man.</ab>
                    <ab>No doubt. Still, you must know many very foolish men who conduct their business with no more wisdom than the man in the valley
                        showed in making a creek.</ab>
                    <ab>Don't you know men who started their business with a rush, gained a certain speed, and then sat back to hear things hum?</ab>
                    <ab>Generally they fall asleep and awaken to find there is no stream flowing through the valley.</ab>
                    <ab>The editors of Live Stories know nothing of any business, except the making of a magazine.</ab>
                    <ab>Maybe, they don't know much about that.</ab>
                    <ab>One thing, however, they know:</ab>
                    <ab>If the stream is to go on running delightfully through the valley, the water must, forever and ceaselessly, be drawn from the
                        well and poured out on the hillside.</ab>
                    <ab>This, at least, the editors of Live Stories know. It is to this they are bending every effort and giving constant
                        attention.</ab>
                    <ab>They are not satisfied. They will never be satisfied.</ab>
                    <ab>The last word is so difficult to reach! The last word? Silently, steadily, it removes itself farther and farther as the weary
                        pursuit goes on.</ab>
                    <ab>But you, they want to please. They want, at least, with each issue, to come nearer to pleasing you.</ab>
                    <ab>In this task, they need your aid.</ab>
                    <ab>You must tell them the whys and the wherefores.</ab>
                    <ab>Will you?</ab>
                    <ab>Just a word about what you like or don't like and why? Remember, out of the deep well of your understanding, the editors draw
                        their inspiration. Let's keep that little stream going down into the valley of your mutual delight.</ab>

                        and does more harm than good). Nuxated Iron is easily assimi- lated, does not blacken nor in- jure the teeth nor upset the
                        stomach. It will increase the strength and endurance of weak, nervous, irritable, careworn, haggard women in two weeks' time
