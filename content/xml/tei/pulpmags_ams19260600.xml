                    <ab>The world was shocked when Alfred W. McCann proved by scientific analysis and investigations that the food the people are now
                        eating is causing ravishing disease, untold misery and premature death.</ab>

                    <ab>Officials, social workers, and physicians were shocked and horrified at his startling exposures. They stood gasping at the
                        truth!</ab>

                    <ab>Are you actually poisoning and thereby killing yourself with the food you eat? Alfred W. McCann in his wonderful book, "THE
                        SCIENCE OF EATING," proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Heart Disease, Diabetes, Colds, Catarrh, Rheumatism, Pyorrhea,
                        Constipation, Cancer, High Blood Pressure, and even Tuberculosis, besides the hundreds of other diseases are caused by eating
                        improper foods. Foods that are either adulterated or refined to such an extent that instead of adding strength and vitality to
                        your body and power to your brain, they are actually poisoning your system and that with each mouthful you are literally
                        digging your grave with your knife and fork.</ab>
                    <ab>"The Science of Eating"</ab>

                    <ab>By Alfred W. McCann</ab>

                    <ab>In "The Science of Eating," Alfred W. McCann exposes all the frauds of the so-called food specialists; all the ignorance of
                        the so-called scientists; all the hypocrisy that the physicians have circulated about food. He exposes and explodes the false
                        and dangerous theory of the calorie. In this remarkable book, the delicate menu of the specialists is shown not only to be
                        valueless, but exceedingly harmful. The fearful crime of adulteration and artificial coloring of foods has been mercilessly
                        exposed. He proves that all food, which is pure food, when free from adulteration and preservatives, is good food.</ab>
                    <ab>Not a Book on Diet but a Book on Eating</ab>

                    <ab>YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT, you cannot take carbolic acid without feeling the effects of it; you cannot consume impure and denatured
                        foods without reaping the harm they will produce. Every organ and nerve of your body suffers from their ill effects. Every
                        disease can be traced to the eating of wrong and impure foods. Wrong eating has done more harm and actually killed more people
                        than all the wars put together. If you want to enjoy strength, vitality and stamina; you can get them from the scientific
                        knowledge contained in this wonderful revelational book, "The Science of Eating," by Alfred W. McCann.</ab>

                    <ab>Send No Money</ab>

                    <ab>You owe it to yourself to know the truths about the foods you eat. The facts are so startling, so convincing, that you should
                        not continue for one more day, habits of eating that are a deadly menace to your health and life.</ab>

                    <ab>Do not think that Alfred W. McCann's remarkable book "The Science of Eating" is for faddists.. It is for everyone. It does not
                        advise irksome diets. It simply shows you how to eat natural foods as nature intended them to be eaten and how to avoid eating
                        so-called foods that are merely disguised poisons. Once you start following this simple method you will be literally astounded
                        at the improvement. You will find yourself possessed of new vitality, new energy, new physical fitness, new youth.</ab>

                    <ab>Prove to yourself without risking a single penny that Alfred W. McCann's amazing book is the one best investment in health you
                        can possibly make. Send for a copy of this wonderful book and when it is delivered pay the postman $3.00 plus postage. If
                        within 5 days you arc not thoroughly convinced that it will literally make a new person of you, return it and your money will
                        be refunded. Order your copy NOW.</ab>

                        <ab>STUART'S PLAPAO-PADS are entirely different--being applicators made self-adhesive purposely to keep the muscle restorative
                            called "Plapao" constantly in contact with the affected muscle? No straps, buckles or obnoxious springs attached. When
                            adhering closely to the body all grinding pressure is obviated; furthermore, slipping is impossible, so cannot chafe or
                            press against the bone. Soft as velvet-easy to apply-inexpensive. In use by thousands for twenty years--most obstinate
                            ruptures reported conquered in privacy of the home without hindrance from work. Awarded Gold Medal, Rome; Grand Prix,
                            Paris; and honorable mention Panama Expo-sition, San Francisco. Process of recovery is natural, so afterwards no further
                            use for trusses. Stop wasting time and money on old-fashioned trusses; close the hernial opening as Nature intended, so

                    <ab>J. E. Greenslade</ab>
                    <ab>President of the National Salesmen's Training Association.</ab>
                    <ab>Let Me Make You a Master Salesman!</ab>
                    <ab>This New Easy Way</ab>
                    <ab>I DON'T care what you are now or what you think. The Association of which I am president will take you in short, easy steps
                        and make a Master Salesman of you, put you in the same class with the big pay men who have all the good things of life, Many
                        have thought that Salesmen were "born." And that idea has kept many men from succeeding. But this Association of Master
                        Salesmen has proved that any man can be taught the rules and principles that make men Master Salesmen. And you know as well as
                        I do that Salesmen top the list of moneymakers. They are the producers and you can lie one of them.</ab>
                    <ab>Easy as A, B, C</ab>
                    <ab>If you are as intelligent as the ordinary mechanic, postal clerk or stenographer, you can quickly master the simple A, B, C,'s
                        of Selling. There arc certain ways of approaching a prospect to get his undivided attention, certain ways to stimulate keen
                        interest, certain ways to overcome objections, batter down prejudices, outwit competition and make the prospect act.</ab>
                    <ab>You can learn these principles at home in a short period of pleasant, inspiring study. And once you have mastered these
                        secrets of Master Salesmanship, you can take advantage of the employment department of the Association without charge. They
                        will help you select and secure a position as soon as you are qualified and ready.</ab>
                    <ab>This is a real opportunity, for during the last year the Association received calls for 49,880 salesmen from the biggest sales
                        organizations in America. And these men are the same as you see above -- men who make from $5,000 to $10,000 a year in salary
                        and commission.</ab>
                    <ab>These are only four out of hundreds of similar records in the Association files. Our members make good because the Association
                        has specialized for eighteen vears in teaching the Art and Science of Salesmanship and teaches the most unusual principles
                        ever laid down for quick success.</ab>
