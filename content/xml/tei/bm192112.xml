                    <ab>[New] Discovery Takes [Your] Flesh Almost [While] You Wait!</ab>
                    <ab>ay the very first week without medicine, cial foods, starving, or exercise.
                        Results in 48 hours.</ab>
                    <ab>simple secret has been discovered by a great food list which enables you to
                        eat a pound a day off your weight with perfect ease. You will have no bitter
                        self-denials; in fact, many users say they enjoy their meals as never
                        before.</ab>
                    <ab>Thousands of men and women who have tried strenuous diets, medicine and
                        violent exercising without results have found this new scientific way a
                        revelation. A pound or more a day from the very start is not too much to
                        look for and with each pound you lose you will note a cor-responding
                        increase in energy and general health.</ab>
                    <ab>Women so stout they could never wear light colors or attractive styles
                        without being conspicu-ous marvel at the change that has enabled them to
                        wear the most vividly colored and fluffy-styled clothes. Men who used to
                        puff when they walked the least bit quickly—men who were rapidly becoming
                        inactive and sluggish, unable to enjoy outdoor exercise or pleasures, find
                        their youth- ful energy returning — to their surprise delight.</ab>
                    <ab>How the Secret Works</ab>
                    <ab>The whole thing about this won- derful new way to reduce, which makes losing
                        flesh a pleasure instead of a task, is a simple system of food combination
                        discovered by Eugene Christian.</ab>
                    <ab>Some of us eat food that is almost immediately converted into muscle, bone
                        and tissue. Others eat food that is quickly converted into use- less fat. In
                        this latter case, the muscles, bones and tissues are robbed of just so much
                        nutrition and strength. That is why fat people have but little resistance
                        and succumb first in case of illness.</ab>
                    <ab>Eugene Christian, the famous Food Specialist, while engaged in one of his
                        extensive food experiments, discov- ered the perfect cure for "disease of
                        obesity," as he calls it. He found that merely by following certain little
                        natural laws, food is converted into essential tissue and muscle, while oniy
                        enough fat is stored up to provide the necessary body heat. Elated with this
                        discovery and what it would mean to thousands of men and women. Christian
                        has incorporated all his valuable information in the form of little
                        easy-to-follow lessons under the name of "Weight Con- trol the Basis of
                        Health," which is offered on free trial.</ab>
                    <ab>There are no fads in this course, no starving, no medi- cines, no exercises
                        — nothing but pure common-sense, practical help that will do just what we
                        say—take off flesh almost while you wait." Eat many of the delicious foods
                        you may have been denying yourself, observing of course moderation. Do
                        pretty much as you please, give up bitter self-denials—just follow the
                        directions outlined in Christian's wonderful course, and watch your super-
                        fluous weight vanish.</ab>
                    <ab>Nothing Like It Before</ab>
                    <ab>YouVe never tried anything like this new method of bugene Christian's
                        before. It's entirely different. Instead of starving you, it shows you how
                        to eat off weight_a pound a day. No trouble, no fuss, no self-denials. All
                        so simple that you'll be delighted—and amazed. </ab>
                    <ab>Here's what Christian's course in Weight Control will do for you. First it
                        will bring down your weight to normal, to what it should naturally be. Then
                        it will make your flesh firm and solid. It will bring a new glow to your
                        cheeks, a new sparkle to your eyes, a new spring in your step. It will give
                        you charm grace, attractiveness. And all naturally, mind you. Nothing
                        harmful. We want you to prove it yourself. We want you to see results; to
                        see your own unnecessary flesh vanish. We want you to see why all starving
                        medicines and strenuous exercising are unnecessary—why this new discovery
                        gets right down to the real reason for your stoutness, and removes it by
                        natural methods.</ab>

                        lessons carefully, and read the startling revelations regarding weight, food
                        and health. Now put the course to the test. Try the first lesson. Weigh
                        yourself in a day or two again and notice the result. Still, you've taken no
                        medicines, put yourself to no hardships, done practically nothing you would

                    <ab>Notable among current musical announcements is that Florence Easton,
                        soprano. Metropolitan Opera Company, now records exclusively for Brunswick.
                        Her initial record (just released) is the Bach-Gounod "Ave Maria."</ab>

                    <ab>A Brunswick Achievement Vouched For By Highest Musical Authorities</ab>
                    <ab>Musicians, critics, teachers, all will tell you the seven- test of a
                        phonograph is in rendering "high notes," espe- cially soprano.</ab>
                    <ab>Remember this when buying a phonograph, and insist that soprano records he
                        played.</ab>
                    <ab>Note, then, how most instruments vibrate, sound "metallic" when the higher
                        notes are reached.</ab>
                    <ab>Then hear the same records on The Brunswick.</ab>
                    <ab>Hear the full range of "high notes." Soprano High "C" in ringing intensity,
                        without slightest "metallic" intrusion—clear-toned, vibrationless! And you
                        will marvel at difference so great in phonographs.</ab>
                    <ab>Note: New Brunswick Rec- ords are on advance sale at all Brunswick dealers
                        on the 16th of each month in the East, and in Denver and the West on the
                        20th.</ab>
                    <ab>Exclusive methods the reason</ab>
                    <ab>By means of exclusive methods of Reproduction and of Interpretation,
                        Brunswick achieves perfect rendition of the so-called "difficult" tones—the
                        piano, the harp, the human voice. Methods which apply to no other
                        phonographs or records.</ab>
                    <ab>The Brunswick Method of Reproduction is exclusively Brunswick. The Brunswick
                        Method of Interpretation, in producing records, has not been successfully
                        imitated.</ab>
                    <ab>Hence, buying any phonograph without at least hearing The Brunswick is a
                        mistake. And to be with- out Brunswick Records is to be without what is best
                        in music.</ab>
                    <ab>Ask your nearest Brunswick dealer for a demonstru. tion. The Brunswick plays
                        all records, and Brunswick Records can be played on any phonograph. Hear,
                        com- pare-—then judge for yourself.</ab>
