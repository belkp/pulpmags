                                    <ab>THE author of "The Lake of Life" outdoes himself in this new story of intrigue and adventures in the weird
                                          Valley of Koom and the eery moun- tains of fire that surround it. This fascinating and compelling
                                          thrill-tale will hold your absorbed interest from first to last.</ab>
                                    <ab>FOUR spies from four different na- tionsâ€”Japan, Russia, England and the United Statesâ€” enter the forbidden
                                          valley, and the saga of their adventures makes a tale to look forward toâ€” a tale of the Place of Power that
                                          was the tomb of the Ancient Onesâ€”a tale of the terrible doom that menaced the world with destruction. This
                                          powerful novel will begin</ab>

                              <ab>I FELT my breath catch in my throat as we came face to face in the moonlight. The general standard of beauty among
                                    the natives of Brittany is high indeed, but in the girl who stood before me the very pinnacle of flawless
                                    perfection seemed to have been reached.</ab>
                              <ab>Her featuresâ€”but how can I describe that which transcends all description? Mere words seem futile and meaningless
                                    when applied to that radiant creature who con- fronted us out of the mystery of the night. Her loveliness seemed
                                    more than human â€”and most assuredly none of it was due to the "art which conceals art" in the esti- mation of the
                                    feminine mind. Her dark hair waved in a profuse disorder of natural curls over her brow and neck. Her smooth skin
                                    was deeply tanned by exposure to the wind and sun. Her cheap cotton frock would have seemed but a mere rag but for
                                    the superb lines of the figure beneath. Her shapely legs were bare to the knees; her feet innocent of even the
                                    wooden sabots which the poorest of peasants usually wear. She seemed more like some dryad of the woods than a
                                    mundane peasant-girl.</ab>
                              <ab>For some reasonâ€”possibly it was the memory of my own recent fearsâ€”her very calmness irritated me.</ab>
                              <ab>"What are you doing here?" I cried as sharply as my halting Breton would allow. "Don't you know that there are
                                    wolves about?"</ab>
                              <ab>To my surprize she answered in the purest French:</ab>
                              <ab>"Assuredly, m'sieu, there are wolves. Have I not just now"â€”she hesitatedâ€” "have I not heard them howling? And
                                    youâ€”you did not climb the Devil's Tomb- stone just to admire the view?" . . .</ab>
                              <ab>You will be fascinated with this posthumous thrill-tale by a late English master of weird fiction. It is an
                                    engrossing novelette of the Ghoul Pack, the Barking Women of Josselin, and the struggle between a mother's love
                                    and an ancient curse. It will be printed complete in the August issue of Weird Tales:</ab>
