                              <ab>Are You Digging Your Grave With Knife and Fork?</ab>
                              <ab>The world was shocked when Alfred W. McCann proved by scientific analysis and investigations that the food the people are now eating is causing ravishing disease,
                                    untold misery and premature death.</ab>

                              <ab>Officials, social workers, and physicians were shocked and horrified at his startling exposures. They stood gasping at the truth!</ab>

                              <ab>Are you actually poisoning and thereby killing yourself with the food you eat? Alfred W. McCann in his wonderful book, "THE SCIENCE OF EATING," proves beyond the
                                    shadow of a doubt that Heart Disease, Diabetes, Colds, Catarrh, Rheumatism, Pyorrhea, Constipation, Cancer, High Blood Pressure, and even Tuberculosis, besides the
                                    hundreds of other diseases are caused by eating improper foods. Foods that are either adulterated or refined to such an extent that instead of adding strength and
                                    vitality to your body and power to your brain, they are actually poisoning your system and that with each mouthful you are literally digging your grave with your
                                    knife and fork.</ab>
                              <ab>"The Science of Eating"</ab>

                              <ab>By Alfred W. McCann</ab>

                              <ab>In "The Science of Eating," Alfred W. McCann exposes all the frauds of the so-called food specialists; all the ignorance of the so-called scientists; all the
                                    hypocrisy that the physicians have circulated about food. He exposes and explodes the false and dangerous theory of the calorie. In this remarkable book, the
                                    delicate menu of the specialists is shown not only to be valueless, but exceedingly harmful. The fearful crime of adulteration and artificial coloring of foods has
                                    been mercilessly exposed. He proves that all food, which is pure food, when free from adulteration and preservatives, is good food.</ab>

                                    will produce. Every organ and nerve of your body suffers from their ill effects. Every disease can be traced to the eating of wrong and impure foods. Wrong eating
                                    has done more harm and actually killed more people than all the wars put together. If you want to enjoy strength, vitality and stamina; you can get them from the

                              <ab>Let Me Make You a Master Salesman!</ab>
                              <ab>This New Easy Way</ab>
                              <ab>I DON'T care what you are now or what you think. The Association of which I am president will take you in short, easy steps and make a Master Salesman of you, put you
                                    in the same class with the big pay men who have all the good things of life, Many have thought that Salesmen were "born." And that idea has kept many men from
                                    succeeding. But this Association of Master Salesmen has proved that any man can be taught the rules and principles that make men Master Salesmen. And you know as
                                    well as I do that Salesmen top the list of moneymakers. They are the producers and you can lie one of them.</ab>
                              <ab>Easy as A, B, C</ab>
                              <ab>If you are as intelligent as the ordinary mechanic, postal clerk or stenographer, you can quickly master the simple A, B, C,'s of Selling. There arc certain ways of
                                    approaching a prospect to get his undivided attention, certain ways to stimulate keen interest, certain ways to overcome objections, batter down prejudices, outwit
                                    competition and make the prospect act.</ab>
                              <ab>You can learn these principles at home in a short period of pleasant, inspiring study. And once you have mastered these secrets of Master Salesmanship, you can take
                                    advantage of the employment department of the Association without charge. They will help you select and secure a position as soon as you are qualified and
                                    ready.</ab>
                              <ab>This is a real opportunity, for during the last year the Association received calls for 49,880 salesmen from the biggest sales organizations in America. And these men
                                    are the same as you see above — men who make from $5,000 to $10,000 a year in salary and commission.</ab>
                              <ab>These are only four out of hundreds of similar records in the Association files. Our members make good because the Association has specialized for eighteen vears in
                                    teaching the Art and Science of Salesmanship and teaches the most unusual principles ever laid down for quick success.</ab>
