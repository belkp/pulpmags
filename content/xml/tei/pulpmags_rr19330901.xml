                        <ab>"It's worked wonders for my teeth. They used to be cloudy and dull. Now you can see how white and sparkling they are. My
                            gums are firmer, too, and my whole mouth feels swell! I've never found any- thing at any price that I liked so well, or
                            gave such good results.</ab>
                        <ab>"And speaking of price, Listerine Tooth Paste has saved me about $3, and I've used it only a year. You see, it costs a
                            quarter, and the difference between that and forty or fifty cents may look small, but it mounts up.</ab>
                        <ab>" That old saying about saving for a rainy day has a new meaning for me. It had already been raining for a couple of years
                            before I woke up, but believe me, I've learned to watch the small items now. I'm darned glad to save $3 on my tooth paste—

                            will look "alive"— sparkling with highlights, glistening with cleanliness.</ab>

                        <ab>The new cleansing and polishing agent in Listerine Tooth Paste cannot scratch or mar the softest tooth sur- face. Yet it's
                            just hard enough to remove the tartar that clings to the teeth.</ab>

                    <ab>Do you like detective stories that are true to life, yet packed with action and excitement?</ab>
                    <ab>There is only one magazine that will give them to you: just one magazine that will give you stories that are packed with
                        action, danger, excitement and suspense and yet are true to life. Not true stories, but true to life—stories in which
                        policemen, detectives, criminals and all other characters talk and act and think just as real policemen, detectives and
                        criminals do—stories that give you an accurate picture of modern crime conditions and modern police methods and weak- nesses.
                        All written by men who know their stuff and who are recognized as the outstanding writers of detective stories today—men whose
                        stories are published in book form by leading publishers, and made into movies by the biggest producers. That magazine
                        is—</ab>
                    <ab>BLACK MASK</ab>
                    <ab>There is no other magazine today to compare with it; no other magazine that will give you one-half the thrill and enjoyment.
                        Here are just four of the many great stories you will find</ab>
                    <ab>In the SEPTEMBER issue—</ab>
                    <ab>"A WOMAN CAN KILL," by Raoul Whitfield</ab>
                    <ab>Dion Davies, of the Dancer and Davies detective agency, is a regular guy. Who Dancer may be is more of a mystery. But there is
                        a girl in the outfit, capable, hard as nails at times, a go-getter, not bad to look at, and in a pinch, able to handle a gun.
                        They have a case of extortion, blackmail and murder, and guns are very useful in the clean-up.</ab>
                    <ab>"WHISPERING JUSTICE," by Erie Stanley Gardner</ab>
                    <ab>Ed Jenkins, The Phantom Crook, was once a crook, paid the penally, reformed and tried to square himself with society. He
                        learned the axiom—"once a crook, always a crook— in the eyes of the law." Every unsolved case was blamed on him. The
                        Underworld and the crooked police declared war upon him—for he knew too much about both for their safety. In "Whispering
                        Justice," he slides between the murder car of killers and their victim, plunges into the midst of a crime in the making, finds
                        an innocent person caught in the meshes and matches his wits against killers' weapons to win freedom for both.</ab>
                    <ab>"MURDER IN JAIL," by Roger Torrey</ab>
                    <ab>A long-sought criminal handcuffed between Dal Prentice and his equally hardboiled part- ner, further guarded by two armed
                        stalwarts with the jail right at hand—and the whole bunch of them "snatched" by a gang of crooks to be "worked on" for the
                        evidence which will give freedom to the killer-criminal. A vivid picture of crime and politics in an American city.</ab>
                    <ab>"GUNS DOWN," by Frederick Nebel</ab>
                    <ab>No more popular appealing figure than Capt. Steve MacBride has appeared for years in this or any other magazine. Hard as
                        flint, absolutely unswerving in his sense for right, no matter how powerful the wrong-doer, liking best to be in action where
                        his men are endangered and bullets are apt to fly, he risks his life unhesitatingly for the lowliest sufferer in the interest
                        of justice.</ab>

                    <ab>While riding out on the range, Kay Cran- don encounters a man preparing to set a forest fire. She soon learns that he is Ted
                        Gaynor, who has become desperate in his attempt to support his mother and sister, so has resorted to this means to create a
                        job for himself as a fire-fighter. The girl believes the man is straight, therefore she offers him</ab>

                    <ab>Presently Tom Runyon sees the brush stacked up nearby; but Kay manages to clear Ted and herself of suspicion. When the girl
                        starts homeward she discovers smoke com- ing from the ranch buildings. Her place is on fire, and upon her arrival she sees
                        that nothing remains but the bunkhouse and a few cabins. Fortunately, Seth Watson has been able to save a desk containing the
                        ranch records and insurance papers. There- upon Josh Hastings of the Flying Six offers his hospitality to the Crandons. Kay
                        refuses to accept it, but her Aunt Kate and her sis- ter, Babs, take advantage of his offer.</ab>

                    <ab>Red River, where Kay learns from the bank- er that the insurance money must be used to pay off the mortgage. He tells her that
                        Josh Hastings is willing to take over the remaining mortgage and pay her five thou- sand dollars cash. Kay denounces Hastings,
                        stating that he wants her land, and insinuat- ing that he is the incendiary. Meanwhile, un- known to Kay, Ted quarrels with
                        Scrap Johnson in Kelly's Saloon when the Flying Six puncher makes scathing remarks about Kay. In the ensuing fray Ted
                        threatens to kill Johnson.</ab>
                    <ab>When Kay relates her experience, Ted suggests that her punchers rebuild the ranch and start anew. The loyal riders fall in
                        with this plan and agree to work without salary until the ranch is on a paying basis again.</ab>
                    <ab>Kay decides to ride to the Flying Six to recount the news to her aunt and sister. When she leaves to see about purchasing some
                        timberland in order to have sufficient lumber for the building, she is waylaid on the trail by Scrap Johnson, who is obviously
                        on the same errand in behalf of Hastings. After pinioning her wrists and ankles, and putting a gag in her mouth, he leaves her
                        and rides away.</ab>

                <ab>OUR AIR MAIL is running daily between the editorial office of RANCH ROMANCES and its readers throughout the world. RANCH ROMANCES
                    is not published for anyone but the read- er, and we want you to look upon this magazine as something distinctly your own. Write
                    and tell us exactly the kind of story that you think ought to go into it. And we want to help make friends for our readers. We
                    want to help you to know friends who are thousands of miles away, or within a stone's throw of your own town. OUR AIR MAIL will be
                    glad to forward and exchange letters. The Editor reserves the right to read and turn over to the Postal Au- thorities, if
                    necessary, anything that is not in keeping with the clean, outdoor spirit of RANCH ROMANCES. Be sure to enclose postage for
                    letters sent by OUR AIR MAIL. Moreover, this department is intended only for readers who actually wish correspondents. Henceforth,
                    each letter must bear the written signature of the writer, and anyone fraudulently signing someone else's name will be
                    investigated.</ab>

                    <ab>SEPTEMBER VIRGO</ab>
                    <ab>VIRGO rules until September twenty-third. These people are fine scholars, musicians and leaders along educational lines. They
                        are original in speech and their minds are quick and well balanced.</ab>
                    <ab>Men of this sign should not waste time in subordinate positions as they are capable executives and work best when independent
                        of domination. Freedom is as necessary to them as air. They chafe under restraint, give way to intolerance and impatience, and
                        become thoroughly unhappy and make others equally wretched.</ab>
                    <ab>Confidence entrusted to the people of this sign is in safe keeping, for nothing under the sun can induce them to betray a
                        trust.</ab>
                    <ab>They are self-conscious and sensitive in the extreme. Though they have a full share of self-esteem, they are, especially in
                        youth, seized with a shyness which, unless checked by reason and the acquirement of poise, becomes almost a panic.</ab>
                    <ab>They make fine loyal friends, and in the home are delightful companions, who are very earnest in their desire to contribute to
                        the comfort of their loved ones.</ab>
                    <ab>In the signs of Leo, Libra and Pisces the people of Virgo will find congenial mates and friends.</ab>

                    <ab>When I thought of my new Introductory Package Plan. I knew it was going to be a great thing. With good jobs scarce my Ad-
                        vertising Plan is a blessing to the unem- ployed and poorly paid. Cash starts coming- in FIRST DAY. Men and women who help me
                        make up to $1.25 an hour for spare time work or $9.50 a day for placing 25 pack- ages. You can work full time or spare time
                        and start taking in money the first day.</ab>
                    <ab>PAY STARTS AT ONCE</ab>
                    <ab>My new plan provides an immediate cash income for honest and reliable men and women. I want someone in every territory to look
                        after my business. My new Trial Pack- age Idea is sweeping the country, so that you can go to work at once right in your own
                        locality.</ab>
                    <ab>VACANCIES BEING FILLED RAPIDLY</ab>
                    <ab>Be next to send your name today. You can't expect an opportunity like this to go begging long. There are a lot of people like
                        yourself who have been our of work, or working for poor wages, who are going to snap up good vacant localities for their own
                        routes. Here's what some have already done: [W. Mincities], Califoria., "Have profits of $75 in six days"; W.A. Canover, New
                        Jersey says, "My daily earnings have been as high as $12.40"; Raymond J. Mura, [][] "Made from $10 to $20 clear profit a
                        day";J. Grunell, Wis., "Made $41.50 first day". G.V. Budaus, Tex., trippled his former income of $20 a week and says, "I now
                        make from [$55 to $85] a week": Mrs. L.P. Mc-Neal Penn., clears $19.92 in ten hours[] time. These expectional earn-ings are
                        proof of amazing possibilites of my offer.</ab>
                    <ab>FREE as an extra BONUS NEW FORD TUDOR SEDAN</ab>
                    <ab>This is NOT a contest or a "prize" for solv-ing puzzles. This Ford is not given to you in place of your money. No! But []
                        [every men who proves] to me that he is "on the job" and building up a real traffic through [] and exp[]ences handling of
                        customers. I give this car as an extra bonus- in addition to what you make every day in cash. If you already ahve a car I'll
                        give you an equal [] in cash in-stead. I'll explain this fully when I send you details of my Trail Package Plan.</ab>
                    <ab>NO LIMIT TO MY OFFER</ab>
                    <ab>You may wonder at making such big money even in hard times. But this plan of Trial Package distribution is doing exactly that
                        for hundreds. The "Trial Package" Plan is simple. Your first work on this new job will be to dis- tribute introductory
                        packages of my line to people in your neighborhood. After they have had a chance to use these products and see how they save
                        money, they give you their orders for full size packages. You handle the money and deliver the goods. And a big share of every
                        dollar we take in goes into your pocket as your pay. The pay for this work is frequently as high as $15 a day. Even at the
                        start placing only 25 trial packages a day will pay you $9.50—regular and steady.</ab>
                    <ab>Your Own Groceries At Wholesale</ab>
                    <ab>When I send you instructions for mak- ing money on my new Trial Package Plan, I also give you rock bottom, whole- sale prices
                        on your own groceries— about half of regular retail prices. This is in addition to your regular pay. So you can MAKE big money
                        in cash and SAVE big money on the things you use in your own home.</ab>
                    <ab>Have Permanent Route With Big Weekly Cash Income</ab>
                    <ab>With my plan you should have a big list of regular customers that you call on every two weeks, and with an es- tablished route
                        which requires only 30 calls a day your pay can easily be $15 a day steady. If you want to have only a 10 call route and work
                        only half days, you can still make up to $7.50 a day— and even that gives you $15 a week— not bad for half time.</ab>
                    <ab>Don't Send Money— Just Your Name</ab>
                    <ab>Don't confuse this with anything you have ever read before—I don't want your money—I need help. Send me your name so I can lay
                        the facts before you, then you can decide if the pay is satisfactory. You don't need experience or capital with me. I furnish
                        every- thing including FORD SEDAN to pro- ducers. Don't expect me to wait indef- initely to hear from you, if you reply
                        promptly it will be a strong thing in your favor with me. SEND TODAY— EVERYTHING IS FREE.</ab>
