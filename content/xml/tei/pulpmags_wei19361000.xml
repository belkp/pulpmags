                    <ab>A SECRET METHOD FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE</ab>
                    <ab>AMENHOTEP IV Founder of Egypt's Mystery Schools</ab>
                    <ab>WHENCE came the knowledge that built the Pyramids and the mighty Temples of the Pharaohs? Civiliza- tion began in the Nile
                        Valley centuries ago. Where did its first builders acquire their astounding wisdom that started man on his upward climb?
                        Beginning with naught they overcame nature's forces and gave the world its first sciences and arts. Did their knowledge come
                        from a race now submerged beneath the sea, or were they touched with Infinite inspiration? From what concealed source came the
                        wisdom that produced such characters as Amenhotep IV, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, and a host of others?</ab>
                    <ab>Today it is known that they discovered and learned to inter- pret certain Secret Methods for the development of their inner
                        power of mind. They learned to command the inner forces within their own beings, and to master life. This secret art of living
                        has been preserved and handed down throughout the ages. Today it is extended to those who dare to use its pro- found
                        principles to meet and solve the problems of life in these complex times.</ab>
                    <ab>This Seeded Book--FREE</ab>
                    <ab>Has life brought you that personal satisfaction, the sense of achieve- ment and happiness that you desire? If not, it is your
                        duty to your- self to learn about this rational method of applying natural laws for the mastery of life. To the thoughtful
                        person it is obvious that every- one cannot be entrusted with an intimate knowledge of the mysteries of life, for everyone is
                        not capable of properly using it. But if you are one of those possessed of a true desire to forge ahead and wish to make use
                        of the subtle influences of life, the Rosicrucians (not a religious or- ganization) will send you A Sealed Book of explanation
                        without obli- gation. This Sealed Book tells how you, in the privacy of your own home, without interference with your personal
                        affairs or manner of liv- ing, may receive these secret teachings. Not weird or strange practices, but a rational application
                        of the basic laws of life. Use the coupon, and obtain your complimentary copy.</ab>

                    <ab>COMING NEXT MONTH</ab>
                    <ab>FROM the black woods beside the trail rose a shriek of blood-curdling laughter. Slavering, mouthing sounds followed it, so
                        strange and garbled that at first I did not recognize them as human words. Their unhuman intonations sent a chill down my
                        spine. </ab>
                    <ab>"Dead men!" the inhuman voice chanted. "Dead men with torn throats! There will be dead men among the pines before dawn! Dead
                        men! Fools, you are all dead!" </ab>
                    <ab>Ashley and I both fired in the direction of the voice, and in the crashing rever- berations of our shots the ghastly chant was
                        drowned. But the weird laugh rang out again, deeper in the woods, and then silence closed down like a black fog, in which I
                        heard the semi-hysterical gasping of the girl. She had released Ashley and was clinging frantically to me. I could feel the
                        quivering of her lithe body against mine. Probably she had merely followed her feminine instinct to seek refuge with the
                        strongest; the light of the match had shown her that I was a bigger man than Ashley. </ab>
                    <ab>"Hurry, for God's sake!" Ashley's voice sounded strangled. "It can't be far to the cabin. Hurry! You'll come with us, Mr.
                        Garfield?" </ab>
                    <ab>"What was it?" the girl was panting. "Oh, what was it?" </ab>
                    <ab>"A madman, I think," I answered, tucking her trembling little hand under my left arm. But at the back of my head was
                        whispering the grisly realization that no madman ever had a voice like that. It sounded--God!--it sounded like some bestial
                        creature speaking with human words, but not with a human tongue! . . . </ab>
                    <ab>You will not want to miss this grim novelette of stark horror--of the terrible disfigurement inflicted upon Adam Grimm by the
                        dark priests of Inner Mongolia, and the frightful vengeance that pursued his enemy to the United States and tracked him down
                        in the Louisiana woods. It will be published complete in the November issue of Weird Tales:</ab>
