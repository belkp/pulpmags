                        <ab>THERE is an eery fascina-tion about tales of the su-pernatural, the unknown and the terrible, a fascination that grips the

                            masterpieces of this kind and prints the best weird fiction in the world today--tales of strange monsters; creepy mys-tery
                            stories; ghost-tales; shud-dery tales of eery horror; tales of devil-worship, witchcraft, vampires and werewolves;
                            ori-entales of wild beauty; this mag-azine also prints the cream of the weird-scientific fiction that is written
                            today--tales of the spaces between the worlds, sur-gical stories, and tales that scan the future with the eye of

                        <ab>A new and revolutionary religious teaching based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the Galilean Carpenter, and
                            designed to show how we may find, understand and use the same identical power which Jesus used in performing His so-
                            called Miracles," is attracting world wide attention to its founder, Dr. Frank B. Robinson, noted psychologist, author and
                            lecturer.</ab>
                        <ab>"Psychiana," this new psychological religion, believes and teaches that it is today possible for every normal human being,
                            understanding spiritual law as Christ understood it, "to duplicate every work that the Carpenter of Galilee ever did"--it
                            believes and teaches that when He said, "the things that I do shall ye do also." He meant what He said and meant it
                            literally to all mankind, through all the ages.</ab>
                        <ab>Dr. Robinson has prepared a 6000 word treatise on "Psychiana," in which he tells about his long search for the Truth, how
                            he finally came to the full realization of an Unseen Power or force so dynamic in itself that all other powers and forces
                            fade into insignificance beside it"--how he learned to commune directly with the Living God, using this mighty,
                            never-tailing power to demonstrate health, happiness and financial success, and how any normal being may find and use it
                            as Jesus did He is now offering this treatise free to every reader of this magazine who writes him.</ab>
                        <ab>If you want to read this "highly interesting, revolutionary and fascinating story of the discov-ery of a great Truth,"

                    <ab>A marvelous tale is this new serial novel by the author of "The Wand of Doom" and "Golden Blood." It is a story of weird mon-

                        story of their ghastly awakening, and the doom that oppressed the world --the story of the weird and glorious being, Maru-Mora,
                        and the lovely Carol Lee--the story of a great scien- tist mad with power.</ab>
                    <ab>This is a romantic story, a thrilling story, a tragic story. Those of you who remember "Golden Blood" by the same author will

                    <ab>COMING NEXT MONTH</ab>
                    <ab>PLACING his two enormous, shapeless hands on the table, Dmitri heaved himself to his feet,[and] a tremendous bellow issued
                        from his barrel-like chest. That summons, though the words were[lost] in a gulf of sound, was unmistakable, and presently the
                        door opened and the little man, prim[ and] neat and wholly a colorless personality, entered.</ab>
                    <ab>"Yes, Master."</ab>
                    <ab>Dmitri stood beside the table, his right hand resting heavily on the polished oak.</ab>
                    <ab>"Sit down, little Stepan."</ab>
                    <ab>The small man, the ghost of a pleased smile on his peasant face, sat down primly in the o[aken] chair and looked about the
                        room with child-like pleasure. Obviously he was enjoying to the utter[most] his small moment.</ab>
                    <ab>"You would prefer the sleep, little one? It is not necessary; we have been through this experi[ment] many times together, you
                        and I."</ab>
                    <ab>"I would prefer the sleep, Master," the little man said, with a slight shudder. "Despite my[self] my eyes flinch from the
                        flame--"</ab>
                    <ab>"Very well." Dmitri's voice was casual and low. "Relax, little one, and sleep. Sleep soundly--["]</ab>
                    <ab>He turned from his servant and picked up the fifty-cent piece. Turning it over and over i[n the] fingers of his left hand he
                        began to speak, slowly.</ab>
                    <ab>"I have told this subject's subconscious that its body is invulnerable to physical injury. Watch[!"]</ab>
                    <ab>The little man was sitting erect in the massive chair. His eyes were closed, his face immo[bile.] Dmitri stooped, lifted an
                        arm, let it fall, then straightened triumphantly and surveyed his silent [audi-] ence. Suddenly, then, a roaring streamer of
                        bluish flame lanced across the room. Dmitri had set [the] gasoline torch alight.</ab>
                    <ab>A woman was babbling hysterically. But above the steady moan of the flame Dmitri said lou[dly] "There is no cause for alarm.
                        Now, observe closely. I am going to go far beyond the ordinary h[ypno] tist's procedure-"</ab>
                    <ab>He carefully picked up, with the pliers, the fifty-cent piece. For a long moment he let the moa[ning] flame play on the coin,
                        until both coin and plier-tips glowed angrily.</ab>
                    <ab>Calmly, without warning, he dropped the burning coin on his servant's naked wrist!</ab>
                    <ab>A woman screamed. But, then, gasps of relief eddied from the tense audience. For, although [the] glowing whiteness of the coin
                        had scarcely begun to fade into cherry-red, the man Stepan had show[n no] sign that he felt pain! There was no stench of
                        burning flesh in the room. Even the fine hairs on [the] back of the servant's wrist, hairs that touched and curled delicately
                        above the burning coin, showed [not] the slightest sign of singeing! . . .</ab>
                    <ab>You will not want to miss this strange story of an unscrupulous hypnotist and the frightful [thing] he called Stepan, who was
                        immune to destruction while his master lived. This story will be pr[inted] complete in the March issue of WEIRD TALES:</ab>

                    <ab>What Strange Powers Did The Ancients Possess?</ab>
                    <ab>EVERY important discovery relating to mind power, sound thinking and cause and effect, as applied to self-advancement, was
                        known centuries ago, before the masses could read and write. Much has been written about the wise men of old. A popular
                        fallacy has it that their secrets of personal power and successful living were lost to the world. Knowledge of nature's laws,
                        accumulated through the ages, is never lost. At times the great truths possessed by the sages were hidden from unscrupulous
                        men in high places, but never destroyed.</ab>
                    <ab>Why Were Their Secrets Closely Guarded?</ab>
                    <ab>Only recently, as time is measured; not more than twenty generations ago, less than 1/100th of 1% of the earth's people were
                        thought capable of receiving basic knowledge about the laws of life, for it is an elementary truism that knowledge is power
                        and that power cannot be entrusted to the ignorant and the unworthy. Wisdom is not readily attainable by the gen- eral public;
                        nor recognized when right within reach. The average person absorbs a multi- tude of details about things, but goes through
                        life without ever knowing where and how to acquire mastery of the fundamentals of the inner mind--that mysterious silent
                        something which "whispers" to you from within.</ab>
                    <ab>Fundamental Laws of Nature</ab>
                    <ab>Your habits, accomplishments and weaknesses are the effects of causes. Your thoughts and actions are governed by fundamental
                        laws. Ex- ample: The law of compensation is as funda- mental as the laws of breathing, eating and sleeping. All fixed laws of
                        nature are as fas- cinating to study as they are vital to under- stand for success in life.</ab>
                    <ab>You can learn to find and follow every basic law of life. You can begin at any time to dis- cover a whole new world of
                        interesting truths. You can start at once to awaken your inner powers of self-understanding and self-advance- ment. You can
                        learn from one of the world's oldest institutions, first known in America in 1694. Enjoying the high regard of hundreds of
                        leaders, thinkers and teachers, the order is known as the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Its complete name is the "Ancient and
                        Mystical Order Rosae Crucis," abbreviated by the ini- tials "AMORC." The teachings of the Order are not sold, for it is not a
                        commercial organi- zation, nor is it a religious sect. It is a non- profit fraternity, a brotherhood in the true sense.</ab>
                    <ab>Not For General Distribution</ab>
                    <ab>Sincere men and women, in search of the truth --those who wish to fit in with the ways of the world--are invited to write for
                        complimen-tary copy of the sealed booklet, "The Secret Heritage." It tells how to contact the librarian of the archives of
                        AMORC for this rare knowledge. This booklet is not intended for general distribution; nor is it sent without re- quest. It is
                        therefore suggested that you write for your copy to Scribe E. Z. Z.</ab>
