                    <ab>Thousands turn to Listerine as science proves it CURES DANDRUFF</ab>
                    <ab>Clinical evidence that Listerine Antiseptic kills queer Pityrosporum ovale germ, that causes dandruff, starts wave of home
                        treatments . . . letters pour in telling of rapid, complete cures</ab>
                    <ab>IT IS WONDERFUL HOW LISTERINE STOPS THAT AWFUL SCALING, ITCHING AND BURNING</ab>
                    <ab>Ever since the amazing dandruff cures accomplished with Listerine became a matter of clinical record, thousands of dandruff
                        sufferers throughout the country have swung over to Listerine for quick, effective relief. Many of them write to us, fervently
                        praising Listerine for what it has done for them.</ab>
                    <ab>Here are a few random excerpts from the hundreds of grateful letters that reach us:</ab>
                    <ab>"Have been using Listerine for only two weeks. Already feel wonderfully relieved from the horrible itchy feeling."</ab>
                    <ab>"Two weeks after first using it my dandruff was gone."</ab>
                    <ab>"Tried Listerine for 21 days and ran find no trace of dandruff now."</ab>
                    <ab>"Tried everything possible, until one day I used Lister- ine. The itching stopped at once. My hair has stopped falling
                        out."</ab>
                    <ab>Kills the Germ</ab>
                    <ab>In the sensational research that established the Pityrosporum ovale germ as the cause of dandruff, it was positively proved
                        that Listerine kills the germ.</ab>
                    <ab>When a mid-western skin clinic instructed dan- druff patients to use the daily Listerine Treatment, a substantial number
                        obtained marked relief within the first two weeks on the average.</ab>
                    <ab>76% of a group of dandruff sufferers at a New Jersey Clinic, who used the Listerine treatment twice daily, showed complete
                        disappearance of, or marked improvement in, the symptoms within thirty days.</ab>
                    <ab>Start Treatment Today</ab>
                    <ab>Don't waste time on ordinary remedies that merely wash away dandruff symptoms temporarily. Start ridding your scalp of the
                        dandruff germ with Lis- terine today.</ab>
                    <ab>And remember, like any other germ disease, dan- druff is a stubborn malady requiring persistent treatment. Even after it has
                        been cured, it is wise to guard against re-infection by occasional Listerine Antiseptic massages at regular intervals.</ab>
                    <ab>Lambert Pharmacal Company, St. Louis, Mo.</ab>
                    <ab>Cut this out</ab>
                    <ab>THE TREATMENT</ab>
                    <ab>Once or twice a day, use full strength Lis- terine on the scalp, spreading it with fingers, or parting the hair and applying
                        with cotton or eye dropper.</ab>
                    <ab>Now massage scalp vigorously and per- sistently with fingertips; active stimulation of the scalp is highly important in
                        dandruff treatment.</ab>
                    <ab>If scalp is excessively dry, use a little olive oil in conjunction with Lis- terine. Listerine will not bleach the hair.</ab>
                    <ab>P. S. Listerine, which has been discovered to be such an excellent germicidal treatment for dandruff, is the same Listerine
                        Antiseptic which has been used as a mouth wash and gargle for years.</ab>

                    <ab>Strange Experiences</ab>
                    <ab>WHO has not experienced that inexplicable phenomenon of sensing an unseen presence? Who has not suddenly realized that he has
                        been listening to a conversation within himself--an eloquent appeal to self from some intangible in- telligence? Who has not
                        had that tenseness, that sensation of a suppressed excitement, as though some power were seeking to manifest through him? Too
                        long have the restrictions of ortho- doxy and the ridicule of unenlightened persons kept these common-place occurrences
                        shrouded in sccrecy. Millions now admit the existence of an intimate persuasive power . . . but centuries of superstition have
                        caused them to fear it.</ab>
                    <ab>Learn what the world's greatest thinkers, artists, poets and geniuses found by accident . . . that the emotional self, the
                        infinite intelligence just beyond the border of your thinking consciousness, is the source of the greatest creative power that
                        the human mind can command. It is the region from which ideas spring, the fountain-head of imagination and forethought.</ab>

                    <ab>Between the ages of 13 and 25, or even longer, important gland changes often upset the system. The skin often becomes
                        over-sensitive. Waste poisons from the intestinal tract may get into the blood stream...and be carried to the skin to cause
                        dis- figuring pimples.</ab>
                    <ab>Many have been helped by the regular use of Fleischmann's Yeast. Millions of tiny, live plants in each cake of this fresh food
                        act to help keep intestinal waste poisons from the blood...and so help your broken-out skin. Start eating Fleischmann's Yeast

                    <ab>Man Can Now Talk With God Says Noted Psychologist</ab>
                    <ab>"A new and revolutionary religious teaching based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the Galilean Carpenter, and
                        designed to show how we may find, understand and use the same identical power which Jesus used in performing His so-called
                        Miracles," is attracting world- wide attention to its founder, Dr. Frank B. Robinson, noted Psychologist, author and lec-
                        turer.</ab>
                    <ab>"Psychiana," this new psychological religion, believes and teaches that it is today possible for every normal human being,
                        understanding spiritual law as Christ understood it, "to du- plicate every work that the Carpenter of Galilee ever did"--it
                        believes and teaches that when He said, "the things that I do shall ye do also." He meant what He said and meant it literally
                        to all mankind, through all the ages.</ab>
                    <ab>Dr. Robinson has prepared a 6,000 word treatise on "Psychiana," in which he tells about his long search for the Truth, how he
                        finally came to the full realization of an Unseen Power or force "so dynamic in itself that all other powers and forces fade
                        into insignificance be- side it"--how he learned to commune directly with the Living God, using this mighty, never- failing
                        power to demonstrate health, happiness and financial success and how any normal being may find and use it as Jesus did. He is
                        now offering this treatise free to every reader of this magazine who writes him.</ab>
                    <ab>If you want to read this "highly interesting, revolutionary and fascinating story of the dis- covery of a great Truth," just
                        send your name and address to Dr. Frank B. Robinson, 418-- 11th Street, Moscow, Idaho. It will be sent free and postpaid

                    <ab>This may be the most important year in your life! Your whole future is apt to de- pend on how you take advantage of present

                        work and pay. Naturally they will pick the men with most preparation and ability.</ab>
                    <ab>You should--you must--make yourself quickly more valuable--to protect what you have and to insure getting your share of the
                        promotions and pay raises. It is being done by OTHERS--it can be done by YOU!</ab>

                            Coroner Arthur White revealed that<lb/> Fothergill had suffered multiple fractures of<lb/> the arms and legs, a crushed
                            chest, and a<lb/> broken neck.<lb/> Doctor Bowen revealed that he had been<lb/> talking on the telephone with Fothergill
                            at<lb/> the approximate time the blast occurred, that<lb/> the line abruptly went dead, and that, be-<lb/> coming alarmed,
                            he dressed and walked to<lb/> Fothergill's home and discovered that the<lb/> tragedy had already occurred. He states<lb/>
                            that he heard no explosion, but rather a loud<lb/> crackling sound. His statement is borne out<lb/> by neighbors, who
                            declared that the sound<lb/> resembled "a large box being broken open."<lb/> Police are inclined to the theory that
                            the<lb/> blast itself may have been relatively sound-<lb/> less.<lb/> Lena Hayes, night telephone operator<lb/> here,
                            confirmed Doctor Bowen's statement<lb/> that Fothergill had called him immediately<lb/> prior to the blast, and that the
                            blast itself<lb/> terminated the conversation. The telephone,<lb/> torn from the wall by the force of the ex-<lb/>
                            plosion, was still clutched in Fothergill's<lb/> hands when he was found.<lb/> State Police are investigating. . .

                    <ab>I have not heard lutes beckon me, nor the brazen bugles call,<lb/> But once in the dim of a haunted lea I heard the silence
                        fall.<lb/> I have not heard the regal drum, nor seen the flags unfurled,<lb/> But I have watched the dragons come, fire-eyed,
                        across the world.<lb/>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>I have not seen the horsemen fall before the hurtling host,<lb/> But I have paced a silent hall where each step waked a
                        ghost.<lb/> I have not kissed the tiger-feet of a strange-eyed golden god,<lb/> But I have walked a city's street where no man
                        else had trod.<lb/>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>I have not raised the canopies that shelter revelling kings,<lb/> But I have fled from crimson eyes and black unearthly
                        wings.<lb/> I have not knelt outside the door to kiss a pallid queen,<lb/> But I have seen a ghostly shore that no man else
                        has seen.<lb/>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>I have not seen the standards sweep from keep and castle wall,<lb/> But I have seen a woman leap from a dragon's crimson
                        stall,<lb/> And I have heard strange surges boom that no man heard before,<lb/> And seen a strange black city loom on a mystic
                        night-black shore.<lb/>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>And I have felt the sudden blow of a nameless wind's cold breath.<lb/> And watched the grisly pilgrims go that walk the roads
                        of Death,<lb/> And I have seen black valleys gape, abysses in the gloom,<lb/> And I have fought the deathless Ape that guards
                        the Doors of Doom.<lb/>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>I have not seen the face of Pan, nor mocked the dryad's haste,<lb/> But I have trailed a dark-eyed Man across a windy
                        waste.<lb/> I have not died as men may die, nor sinned as men have sinned,<lb/> But I have reached a misty sky upon a granite
                        wind.<lb/>

                    <ab>MORE LIVES THAN ONE By Seabury Quinn</ab>
                    <ab>HERE is an unusual weird story that skips through the years and ends at last in the United States at the pres- ent day. Those
                        of you who enjoyed reading the same author's story, "The Globe of Memories" (and your names are legion, as "The Globe of
                        Memories" was one of the most popular stories ever published in WEIRD TALES) will thoroughly enjoy this tale on a some- what
                        similar theme.</ab>
                    <ab>BEGINNING in the Netherlands un- der the Spanish occupation, the story takes the reader into the home of the rich burgher
                        Pieter van Werff, whose son is shortly to be married to Lysbeth van de Doren, and shows us how that heroic girl accepted shame
                        and disgrace to save those she loved, only to be betrayed by them. Through sev- eral lives runs the story, until the young van
                        Werff at last gets the chance to atone for his treachery. This ro- mantic and fascinating novelette will be published
                        complete.</ab>

                        constant movement.</ab>
                    <ab>This screen was a vivid presentment of a human sacrifice. Bound on the stone altar, a woman appeared to writhe and quiver. Her

                        frenzy. And behind the candles' flare and flicker, at each of the four corners of the altar, a veiled figure towered.
                        Menacing, gigantic, these figures were the only immovable objects on the screen, and they achieved by their fateful
                        stillness--in contrast with the surge and movement of all else in the picture--an effect of final inescapable doom. Dark
                        crescent moons poised above each veiled head of these four attendant genii, bearing Hebrew characters which read-- EARTH.

                    <ab>And now Sant saw the black-clad figure--the body of Stephen Lynn, torn and wrenched, trembling from head to foot in diabolic
                        ecstasy, arms flung wide, head bent backward so that light from the suspended globe beat full and fiercely down upon the
                        upturned face. Louder--louder rang the great triumphant organ voice, pealing out into the unclean silence of the chapel's
                        gloom, beating against the curved and shining walls which sent back clashing paeans of tremendous harmony. . . .</ab>

                    <ab>RIPLEY'S EXPLANATION: 26 Mile Knee Crawl Over Untreated Concrete! The world's longest foot-race is the Olympic Marathon- 26
                        miles, 385 yards. Tom Boyd went the distance on his knees, over untreated con- crete, wearing unprotected Lee Jelt Denim
                        Overalls, every step supervised by a Certified Public Account- ant. He had to quit once, because the skin on his knees wore
                        out! The "C. P. A." sent me the certified report and the Lee Overalls. The denim looks as if it had miles of grueling wear
                        left in it. The strong multiple-twist yarn puts amazing strength in this genuine Jelt Denim for the toughest job.</ab>
                    <ab>166,344 Trampling Feet --A strip of Jelt Denim, the identical special denim used in Lee Overalls, was pat down in the entrance
                        of a towering skyscraper. 83,172 people walked across it taking an average of 3 steps each on the Jelt Denim! 249,516 steps
                        alto- gether! The Jelt Denim, while showing some wear, didn't have a hole or a break, still held its blue color! Here's
                        amazing proof of Lee Overalls extra wear for your money--Believe It Or Not!</ab>
