                    <ab>Kill Kidney Acids</ab>
                    <ab>Don't Take Drastic Drugs</ab>
                    <ab>You have 9 million tiny tubes or filters in your Kidneys, which are at work
                        night and day cleaning out Acids and poisonous wastes and purifying your
                        blood, which circulates thorugh your kidneys 200 times an hour. So it's no
                        wonder that poorly functioning Kidneys may be the real cause of feeling
                        tired, run-down, nervous, Get- ting Up Nights, Rheumatic Pains and other
                        troubles.</ab>
                    <ab>Nearly everyone is likely to suffer from poorly functioning Kidneys at times
                        because modern foods and drinks, weather changes, exposure, colds, nervous
                        strain, worry and over-work often place an extra heavy load on the
                        Kidneys.</ab>
                    <ab>But when your Kidneys need help, don't take chances with drastic or
                        irritating drugs. Be careful. If poorly functioning Kidneys or Bladder make
                        you suffer from Getting Up Nights, Leg Pains, Nervousness, Stiffness,
                        Burning, Smarting, Itching Acidity, Rheu- matic Pains, Lumbago, Loss of
                        Vitality, Dark Circles under the eyes, or Dizziness, don't waste a minute.
                        Try the Doctor's pre- scription Cystex (pronounced Siss-tex). See for
                        yourself the amaz- ing quickness with which it soothes, [t]ones and cleans
                        raw, sore irritated membranes.</ab>
                    <ab>Cystex is a remarkably successful prescription for poorly func- tioning
                        Kidneys and Bladder. It is helping millions of sufferers, and many say that
                        in just a day or so it helped them sleep like a baby, brought new strength
                        and energy, eased rheumatic pains and stiffness made them feel years
                        younger. Cystex starts cir- culating through the system in 15 minutes,
                        helping the Kidneys In their work of cleaning out the blood and removing
                        poisonous acids and wastes in the system. It does its work quickly and
                        positively but does not contain any dopes, narcotics or habit- forming
                        drugs. The formula is in every package.</ab>

                        you up to your com- plete satisfaction or money back on return of empty
                        package. It's only 3c a dose. Ask your druggist for Cystex today and see for
                        yourself how much younger, stronger and better you can feel by simply

                    <ab>City Health Doctor Praises Cystex</ab>
                    <ab>Doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the prescription Cystex because
                        of its splendid ingredients and quick action. For instance. Dr. W. R.
                        George, graduate Med- ical Dept., University of Indiana, former Health
                        Commissioner or Indianapolis, and Med- ical Director for insur- ance company
                        10 years, recently wrote the fol- lowing letter: "There is little ques- tion
                        but what properly functioning Kidney and Bladder organs are vital to the
                        health. Insuf- ficient Kidney excre- tions are the cause of much needless
                        suffering with aching back, weak- ness, painful joints and rheumatic pains,
                        headaches and a general run-down, ex- hausted body. This condition also in-
                        terferes with normal rest at night by caus- ing the sufferer to rise
                        frequently for relief, and results in painful excretion, itching, smarting
                        and burning. I am of the opinion that Cystex definitely corrects frequent
                        causes (poor kidney functions) of such con- ditions and I have actually
                        prescribed in my own practice for many years past the same ingredients
                        contained in your formula. Cys-tex not only exerts a splendid influence in
                        flushing poisons from the urinary tract, but also has an antiseptic action
                        and assists in freeing the blood or retained toxins. Be- lieving as I do
                        that so meritorious a prod-uct deserves the endorsement of the Medical
                        Profession, I am happy indeed to lend my name and photograph for your use in
                        adver-tising Cystex." Signed W. R. George, M. D.</ab>

                    <ab>DULL, blotchy skin, headaches, no pep—how often these are due to
                        constipation! In many cases the real cause of consti- pation is insufficient
                        vitamin B. If your case fails to respond to ordinary treatment, a shortage
                        of this element is probably to blame. Therefore, with adequate vitamin B,
                        elimination will be-come easy and regular. </ab>
                    <ab>Yeast Foam Tablets furnish this factor in abundance. They are pure yeast—the
                        richest known food source of the vitamins B and G. These elements stimulate
                        the digestive system, give tone to intestinal nerves and muscles. Then, as
                        elimination improves, energy revives, headaches go, the skin clears! Get a

                    <ab>I SAID THE SAME THING UNTIL I DISCOVERED KELP-A-MALT</ab>
                    <ab> New Mineral Concen- trate From The Sea, Rich in FOOD IODINE Building Up
                        Weak, Run Down Folks Where All Else Fails!</ab>
                    <ab>Here's good news for "Naturally Skinny" folks who can't seem to add an ounce
                        no matter what they eat. A new way has been found to add flattering pounds
                        of good, solid flesh and fill out those ugly, scrawny hollows even on men
                        and women who have been underweight for years; 5 pounds in 1 week guaran-
                        teed—15 to 20 pounds in few weeks not uncommon.</ab>
                    <ab>This new discovery, called Kelp-a- Malt, now available in handy tab- lets
                        offers practically all the vitally essenlial food minerals in highly
                        concentrated form. These minerals so necessary to the digestion of fats and
                        starches—the weight-mak- ing elements in your daily diet— include a rich
                        supply of pre- cious FOOD iodine: Kelp-a -Malt's FOOD IO-DINE nour- ishes
                        the in-ternal glands which control assimilation, the process of converting
                        di- gested food into firm, solid flesh. 6 Kelp-a-Malt tablets con-tain more
                        FOOD IO-DINE than 480 lbs. of spinach, 1600 lbs. of beef, 1389 lbs. of
                        lettuce.</ab>
                    <ab>Helps Correct Gas, Acidity, Constipation</ab>
                    <ab>Large numbers of people are using Kelp-a-Malt for stomach troubles, gas,
                        acidity, intestinal disorders and constipation. Kelp-a-Malt is rich in
                        sodium which quickly converts an acid stomach to normal alkalinity. Also
                        phosphorus and sulphur, the vital elements necessary for prompt elimination
                        of body wastes.</ab>
                    <ab>Try Kelp-a-Malt for a single week and notice the difference—how much better
                        you sleep, how your appetite improves, how ordinary stomach distress
                        vanishes. Watch flat chest and skinny limbs fill out, and flattering extra
                        pounds appear. Kelp-a-Malt is prescribed and used by physicians. Fine for
                        children, too. Remember the name, Kelp-a- Malt, the original kelp and malt
                        tablets. Nothing like them so do not accept imitations. Try Kelp-a- Malt.

                    <ab>This experience, long known to Camel smokers, has now been confirmed by a

                        That's when a Camel tastes like a million dol- lars. Camels have a
                        refreshing way of bringing my energy up to a higher level. And I can smoke

                    <ab>So, whenever you want a "lift," just smoke a Camel. You can smoke them
                        steadily. For the finer, MORE EXPENSIVE TO- BACCOS in Camels never get on
