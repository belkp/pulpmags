                                    <ab>A new and revolutionary religious teaching based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the Galilean
                                          Carpenter, and designed to show how we may find, understand and use the same identical power which Jesus
                                          used in performing His so- called Miracles," is attracting world wide attention to its founder, Dr. Frank B.
                                          Robinson, noted psychologist, author and lecturer.</ab>
                                    <ab>"Psychiana," this new psychological religion, believes and teaches that it is today possible for every normal
                                          human being, understanding spiritual law as Christ understood it, "to duplicate every work that the
                                          Carpenter of Galilee ever did"—it believes and teaches that when He said, "the things that I do shall ye do
                                          also." He meant what He said and meant it literally to all mankind, through all the ages.</ab>
                                    <ab>Dr. Robinson has prepared a 6000 word treatise on "Psychiana," in which he tells about his long search for the
                                          Truth, how he finally came to the full realization of an Unseen Power or force so dynamic in itself that all
                                          other powers and forces fade into insignificance beside it"—how he learned to commune directly with the
                                          Living God, using this mighty, never-tailing power to demonstrate health, happiness and financial success,
                                          and how any normal being may find and use it as Jesus did He is now offering this treatise free to every
                                          reader of this magazine who writes him.</ab>

                              <ab>PLACING his two enormous, shapeless hands on the table, Dmitri heaved himself to his feet,[and] a tremendous bellow
                                    issued from his barrel-like chest. That summons, though the words were[lost] in a gulf of sound, was unmistakable,
                                    and presently the door opened and the little man, prim[ and] neat and wholly a colorless personality,
                                    entered.</ab>
                              <ab>"Yes, Master."</ab>
                              <ab>Dmitri stood beside the table, his right hand resting heavily on the polished oak.</ab>
                              <ab>"Sit down, little Stepan."</ab>
                              <ab>The small man, the ghost of a pleased smile on his peasant face, sat down primly in the o[aken] chair and looked
                                    about the room with child-like pleasure. Obviously he was enjoying to the utter[most] his small moment.</ab>
                              <ab>"You would prefer the sleep, little one? It is not necessary; we have been through this experi[ment] many times
                                    together, you and I."</ab>
                              <ab>"I would prefer the sleep, Master," the little man said, with a slight shudder. "Despite my[self] my eyes flinch
                                    from the flame—"</ab>
                              <ab>"Very well." Dmitri's voice was casual and low. "Relax, little one, and sleep. Sleep soundly—["]</ab>
                              <ab>He turned from his servant and picked up the fifty-cent piece. Turning it over and over i[n the] fingers of his left
                                    hand he began to speak, slowly.</ab>
                              <ab>"I have told this subject's subconscious that its body is invulnerable to physical injury. Watch[!"]</ab>
                              <ab>The little man was sitting erect in the massive chair. His eyes were closed, his face immo[bile.] Dmitri stooped,
                                    lifted an arm, let it fall, then straightened triumphantly and surveyed his silent [audi-] ence. Suddenly, then, a
                                    roaring streamer of bluish flame lanced across the room. Dmitri had set [the] gasoline torch alight.</ab>
                              <ab>A woman was babbling hysterically. But above the steady moan of the flame Dmitri said lou[dly] "There is no cause
                                    for alarm. Now, observe closely. I am going to go far beyond the ordinary h[ypno] tist's procedure-"</ab>
                              <ab>He carefully picked up, with the pliers, the fifty-cent piece. For a long moment he let the moa[ning] flame play on
                                    the coin, until both coin and plier-tips glowed angrily.</ab>
                              <ab>Calmly, without warning, he dropped the burning coin on his servant's naked wrist!</ab>
                              <ab>A woman screamed. But, then, gasps of relief eddied from the tense audience. For, although [the] glowing whiteness
                                    of the coin had scarcely begun to fade into cherry-red, the man Stepan had show[n no] sign that he felt pain!
                                    There was no stench of burning flesh in the room. Even the fine hairs on [the] back of the servant's wrist, hairs
                                    that touched and curled delicately above the burning coin, showed [not] the slightest sign of singeing! . . .</ab>
                              <ab>You will not want to miss this strange story of an unscrupulous hypnotist and the frightful [thing] he called

                              <ab>What Strange Powers Did The Ancients Possess?</ab>
                              <ab>EVERY important discovery relating to mind power, sound thinking and cause and effect, as applied to
                                    self-advancement, was known centuries ago, before the masses could read and write. Much has been written about the
                                    wise men of old. A popular fallacy has it that their secrets of personal power and successful living were lost to
                                    the world. Knowledge of nature's laws, accumulated through the ages, is never lost. At times the great truths
                                    possessed by the sages were hidden from unscrupulous men in high places, but never destroyed.</ab>
                              <ab>Why Were Their Secrets Closely Guarded?</ab>
                              <ab>Only recently, as time is measured; not more than twenty generations ago, less than 1/100th of 1% of the earth's
                                    people were thought capable of receiving basic knowledge about the laws of life, for it is an elementary truism
                                    that knowledge is power and that power cannot be entrusted to the ignorant and the unworthy. Wisdom is not readily
                                    attainable by the gen- eral public; nor recognized when right within reach. The average person absorbs a multi-
                                    tude of details about things, but goes through life without ever knowing where and how to acquire mastery of the
                                    fundamentals of the inner mind—that mysterious silent something which "whispers" to you from within.</ab>
                              <ab>Fundamental Laws of Nature</ab>
                              <ab>Your habits, accomplishments and weaknesses are the effects of causes. Your thoughts and actions are governed by
                                    fundamental laws. Ex- ample: The law of compensation is as funda- mental as the laws of breathing, eating and
                                    sleeping. All fixed laws of nature are as fas- cinating to study as they are vital to under- stand for success in
                                    life.</ab>
                              <ab>You can learn to find and follow every basic law of life. You can begin at any time to dis- cover a whole new world
                                    of interesting truths. You can start at once to awaken your inner powers of self-understanding and self-advance-
                                    ment. You can learn from one of the world's oldest institutions, first known in America in 1694. Enjoying the high
