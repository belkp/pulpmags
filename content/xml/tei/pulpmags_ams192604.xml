                        <ab>AS I passed the President's office I could not help hearing my name.
                            Instinctively I paused to listen. "That human clam," he was saying,
                            "can't represent us. he's a hard worker, but he seems to have no ability
                            to express himself. I had hoped to make him a branch manager this fall,
                            but he seems to withdraw farther and farther into his shell all the
                            lime. I've given up hopes of making anything out of him."</ab>
                        <ab>So that was it! That was the reason why I had been passed over time and
                            again when promotions were being made! That was why I was just a plodder
                            — a truck horse for our firm, capable of doing a lot of heavy work, but
                            of no use where brilliant performance was required. I was a failure
                            unless I could do what seemed impossible — learn to use words
                            forcefully, effectively and convincingly.</ab>

                        <ab>And then suddenly I discovered a new, easy method which made me a
                            powerful speaker almost overnight. I learned how to bend others to my
                            will, how to dominate one man or an audience of thousands. Soon I had on
                            salary increases, promotion, popularity, power. Today I always have a
                            ready flow of speech at my command. I am able to rise</ab>

                        <ab>to any occasion, to meet any emergency with just the right words. And I
                            accomplished all this by developing the natural power of speech
                            possessed by everyone, hut cultivated by so few — by simply spending 15
                            minutes a day in the privacy of my own home, on this most fascinating
                            subject.</ab>
                        <ab>There is no magic, no trick, no mystery about becoming a powerful and
                            convincing talker. You, too, can conquer timidity, stage fright,
                            self-consciousness and bashfulness, winning advancement in salary,
                            popularity, social standing, and success. Today business demands for the
                            big, important high-salaried jobs, men who can dominate others — men who
                            can make others do as they wish. It is the power of forceful, convincing
                            speech that causes one man to jump from obscurity to the presidency of a
                            great corporation ; another from a small, unimportant territory to a
                            sales manager's desk: another from the rank and file of political
                            workers to a post of national importance; a timid, retiring,
                            self-conscious man to change almost overnight into a popular and much
                            applauded after-dinner speaker. Thousands have accomplished just such
                            amazing tilings through this simple, easy, yet effective training.</ab>

                        <span type="columnLine">has become of the rest of Algeria: if we cannot get</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">confident in my mind. I was going fast all over.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">My heart, for example, was beating a thousand</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">at all. I looked out of the window. An immovable</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">behind his driving-wheel, scorched to overtake a</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">I cried, "how long will this confounded stuff last?"</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">"Heaven knows!" he answered. "Last time I took</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">think—it seemed like hours. But after a bit it slows</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">there were a driver, you know, and a conductor, and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">eleven people! The effect as we walked about the</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">slightly. As my feet grew larger, threatening to</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">touch it, I hastily drew them up with ease and hung</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">suspended in the sky in a half-sitting position as I</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">I saw no longer, but there were faint streaks of</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">light in circles about the sun, and I understood that</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">these were the tracks of the worlds that now moved</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">about their parent too swiftly to be followed with</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">seemed to cease. I could now see no planets, only</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the tiny sun moving farther and farther, faster and</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">faster along its path. I could discern, it seemed</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">the opposite way on the other. In front, they seemed</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">to move across my vision. Gradually I came to un-</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">nearer and nearer. It seemed necessary for me to</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">move somehow, so I drew my legs up and shot them</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">out with all my force. I began to move slowly</span>

                    </ab>
                    <ab><span type="columnLine">This is one of the strange parts of the story—</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">the part the dog played, and what came after.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">Although it is a trivial thing it is one of the most</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">inexplicable. Did the dog sense it? We have no</span>

                    <ab><span type="columnLine">Nevertheless it decided Pizzozi. The cattle</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">needed salt. He would catch up his pinto and ride</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">intenseness. The way of Pizzozi was musical even</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">if not operatic. He had a long-range call, a rising</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">rhythm that for depth and tone had a peculiar</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">effect on the shattered stillness. It echoed and</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">ing; the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">display a white line of a ball; the lips moved slug-</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">gishly, and from between them, in a barely audible</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">whisper, issued the words:</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">There are, indeed, two or three epithets which</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">I might say, for example, that the sound was harsh,</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">and broken, and hollow; but the hideous whole is</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">indescribable, for the simple reason that no similar</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I</span>

                        <span type="columnLine">to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity.</span>
                        <span type="columnLine">In the first place, the voice seemed to reach our</span>
