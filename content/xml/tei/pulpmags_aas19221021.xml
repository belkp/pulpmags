                    <ab>You can possess the appealing beauty of soft, smooth, perfect skin and charming complexion thru the use of Hinds Cream Toilet Requisites.</ab>

                    <ab>HINDS Honey and Almond CREAM not only improves the complexion but keeps the arms and hands attractive. It softens the cuticle in manicuring and relieves tenderness. Men use it
                        after shaving for skin-comfort, to soften and heal. Skin which has become roughened, irritated by sun, wind or dust, chapped skin and other unnatural conditions are alleviated
                        quickly by Hinds Cream; its faithful use soon restores the skin to the clear, soft beauty of perfect health.</ab>
                    <ab>The Powder Base -- Perfection. So many patrons of our Hinds Honey and Almond Cream are now using it as a base for face powder, and with such gratifying results, that we are
                        urging you to give it a trial. 'Twill cost you only a few cents for a trial bottle and the process is extremely simple. Just moisten the skin with the cream and allow it to
                        nearly dry, then dust on the powder. It will adhere wonderfully and remain in perfect condition longer than any other base we know of. The cream and powder will prevent the
                        skin from becoming rough and chapped.</ab>
                    <ab>HINDS Cold CREAM contains the same essentials as the liquid cream and is valuable for its cleansing, healing qualities. Good for baby's skin troubles. A perfect massage cream,
                        semi-greaseless; improves the complexion. Home demonstration tube actual size illustrated, 10c postpaid.</ab>
                    <ab>HINDS Disappearing CREAM is greaseless, rarely delicate, softening, refining--protects the complexion and adds charm. A perfect base for face powder. Relieves "catchy fingers"
                        while you sew without soiling the fabric. Home demonstration tube actual size illustrated, 10c postpaid.</ab>
                    <ab>HINDS Cre-mis FACE POWDER, impalpably fine and soft. Its delicate tints blend to produce the coveted effect and, with its subtle and distinctive fragrance, enhance the charm of
                        every woman who uses it -- white, flesh, pink, brunette. Large box, 60 cents. Trial box, 15 cents. Sample, 2 cents.</ab>

                        <ab>One hundred dollars a week! And only a few years ago his weekly wage was less than $30. Didn't dream he could do it when he first took up the study of Higher Accounting
                            under the LaSalle Problem Method; but he just couldn't help getting ahead -- so he wrote -- because he found it the most interesting thing he evertackled.</ab>
                        <ab>Knew nothing about bookkeeping, but LaSalle quickly gave him the necessary foundation. Then, step by step, he was trained in the practical work of Cost Accounting,
                            Auditing, Business Law, Organization, Management, Finance, Income Tax Procedure -- not theoretically, mind you, but by the solving of actual problems lifted bodily from
                            business life. As a result, he sits as Auditor at a big mahogany desk and commands a salary of $5,200 a year.</ab>

                        <ab>Typical, this man's experience, of that of thousands of ambitious men who have found their path to success in the LaSalle Problem Method. Never in the history of business
                            has the need for trained accountants been so great or the rewards so attractive. The files of LaSalle Extension University contain literally thousands of letters reporting
                            rapid advancement -- incomes doubled, tripled and quadrupled as the result of home-study training. During three months' time, 1,089 LaSalle members wrote to the University
                            telling of the "raises" they had got as a result of their training. The average increase per man was 56 per cent.</ab>

                        <ab>WOMEN, give thanks to Mr. McGowan -- an English scientist, scarce out of his twenties. His discovery means that a beautiful skin is now a mere matter of personal
                            cleanliness; made beautiful while you wait!</ab>
                        <ab>The element he has found physics one's skin. Its action is gentle, but positive. Its use is delightful, for it is applied outside. Put it on, slip into your easy chair; in
                            less than an hour the skin pores move.</ab>
                        <ab>Impurities clogging your facial pores are instantly banished; even the pores themselves are contracted and rendered invisible. The new bloom of color and velvety texture of
                            skin are simply marvelous.</ab>
                        <ab rend="bold">Cleanses Pores and Beautifies Any Complexion in Forty Minutes!</ab>
                        <ab>The scientific name of this new element is Terra-derma-lax. It is blended into a soft, plastic clay of exquisite smoothness. Place it on the face like a poultice. Soon, you
                            feel this laxative working on every inch of skin. In half an hour wipe off with a towel -- and with it every black-head, pimple-point, speck and spot of dirt. That's all.
                            Terra-derma-lax must be fresh, so every jar is dated and shipped direct.</ab>
                        <ab rend="bold">AMAZING OFFER! NO LABORATORY CHARGE FOR FIRST JAR!</ab>
                        <ab>Prescription cost of this marvelous beauty clay has been $5. But so all may try it, just one jar full size will be sent for $1.88 -- the bare cost of materials, plus
                            postage! See offer below:</ab>
                        <ab>With each jar (two months's supply) comes McGowan's own directions. Pay postman the small, actual cost charges of $1.88, plus the few cents postage on delivery: or if you
                            expect to be out, $2 bill enclosed will bring jar prepaid. In either case, anyone whose skin and complexion do not receive instantaneous and astonishing benefits, may have
                            money back.</ab>

                    <ab>"Funny thing, too . . . When he first came here he was just an ordinary worker. For a time, when things were slack, I even thought that we might have to let him go.</ab>
                    <ab>"Then, gradually, I noticed an improvement in his work. He seemed to really understand what he was doing.</ab>
                    <ab>One day he came into my office and said he had worked out a new arm for the automatic feeder. I was a little skeptical at first, but when he started explaining to me. I could
                        see that he had really discovered something. And when I started questioning him, I was amazed. He certainly did know what he was talking about.</ab>
                    <ab>"So we sat down and talked for over an hour. Finally. I asked him where he had learned so much about his work. He smiled and took a little book from his pocket.</ab>
                    <ab>"'There's no secret about it,' he said. "The answer's right here. Four months ago I saw one of those advertisements of the International Correspondence Schools. I had been
                        seeing them for years, but this time something inside of me said, Send in that coupon. It was the best move I ever made -- I knew it the minute I started my first lesson.
                        Before, I had been working in a sort of mental fog -- just an automatic part of the machine in front of me. But the I. C. S. taught me to really understand what I was
                        doing.</ab>
                    <ab>"Well, that was just a start. Three times since he has come to me with improvements on our machines -- improvements that are being adopted in other plants and on which he
                        receives a royalty. He is certainly a splendid example of the practical value and thoroughness of I. C. S. training."</ab>
                    <ab>Every mail brings letters from students of the I. C. S. telling of advancements and larger salaries won through spare-time study. There's still a chance for you, if you will
                        only make the start.</ab>

                    <ab>IN a vast plot of the Mahratta states to overthrow the British Empire, Dandhu Fanth, adopted son fo the present Peshwa, is endeavoring either to make an ally of or to destroy
                        Amir Khan, independent leader of a hundred thousand Pindari horsemen. Colonel Hodson, British Resident, has suspected the revolt and has asked Captain Barlow, hs daughters
                        fiance, to gain Amir Khan for the British. Fighting intrigue with intrigue, Dandhu Panth engages two hundred Bagree decoits, professional robbers, under the leadership of
                        Sookdee, Ajeet, and the latter's villainous lieutenant, Hunsa. Having acquired the Bagnees by a ruse, Dandhu Panth reuses to feed or pay them until their small band has kilkd
                        Amir Kahn. The decoits, realizing the hopelessness of their position, refuse to throw away their lives against the hundred thousand, and matters are at a standstill until Hunsa
                        suggests that Ajeet's woman, Bootea, the Gulab Begum, or Rose Queen, act as Judith in the great leader's camp. She has already unwittingly been used as a trap for the
                        susceptible Barlow. Meanwhile, short of food and restless, the Bagrees have declared a decoity, an authorized raid on the train of a jewel merchant. The camp is athrob with
                        crossed intrigues, caste against caste, Hunsa agnnst Ajeet, but united in the morrow's thievery.</ab>

                    <ab>NOT since the time when Izzy Kaplan had been mistaken for an umpire by an enthusiastic fan with a pop bottle had McGeehan seen his partner so upset as when, one night when the
                        telegraph instrument had just clicked up the story of a fight, Izzy came stamping into the newspaper office. His eyes blazed fire, his teeth gleamed hungrily, his hands clawed
                        the air. It was not that Izzy had picked the wrong man to win. Izzy is too much of an expert to let details bother him. What made Izzy froth was that as he approached the
                        Garden a small, dark stranger had darted from one of the pillars, grabbed him by the buttonhole, and tried to sell him, Izzy Kaplan, a ticket to the fight.</ab>
                    <ab>For twenty minutes McGeehan abandoned his role of silent partner to assure Izzy that he did not look like the kind of person who pays to get into anything. At the end of that
                        time Izzy was sufficiently coherent to give to the world his views on The Gate Receipts. -- The Editor.</ab>

                    <ab>A FELLER writing into me is esking me who I would consider the biggest feller which ever was in sports. I am sorry that I couldn't mention the name on account I don't know it,
                        but the feller, in my opinion, which he done it the biggest thing for sports, was the feller which inwentioned gate reseats. Gate reseats is what the customers pay to see the
                        show, and if there wasn't no gate reseats the sporting business would be practically nothing at all.</ab>
                    <ab>I was esking Benneh Leonard, which me and him is chust like that, if he would be in the box fighting business if there was no gate reseats, and he answered me pretty quick:
                        "Izzy, I am surprised that you should think I was such a rotten busi- ness man." And so it is with all of them sporting fellers like Chack Dempsey and Baby Ruthstein. If there
                        was no gate reseats them fellers would be all Joining a trade so they could get it a chob somewhere.</ab>
                    <ab>It is the same way with Texas Rickardstein, the great box fighting promoter. I esked him only the other day what it was which attractioned him into the box fighting game when
                        he had a nice salooning business in Nevada. "Izzy," he told me, "this is confidential between me and you, and you shouldn't told nobody. It was the gate reseats that
                        attractioned me."</ab>

                    <ab>Texas Rickardstein should know something about gate reseats on account the gate reseats of the Chack Dempsey-George Carpetstein right alone was worth over a million and a haluf
                        dollars. It would almost make a feller cry now to read how Chim Corbett and Choe Choynski had it a box fighting on a Secremento River ranal boat with no box reseats at all.
                        Choe Choynski's old man, which he was a business man from Russia, like myseluf, never forgave Choe for the foolishness. But it wasn't Choe's fault, on account gate reseats
                        hadn't been inwentioned yet.</ab>
                    <ab>I could remember back to the days when Abie Abie was a champeen box fighter. There was a business man. Before he would go into the ring he would alwavs esk the feller which was
                        promotioning the show: "How much is the gate reseats?" And Abie wouldn't take the feller's word for it, neither. Abie was too smart. Before he</ab>
                    <ab>
                        <caption>HE WOULD ALWAYS COUNT THE HOUSE HIMSELUF</caption>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>would hit the other feller a smesh on the chin he would always count the house himseluf while the box fighting was going on.</ab>
                    <ab>Besides being a wery smart business man Abie also was a wery smart box in ah ter. The other feller would be trying to hit him a poke in the eye. but Abie could duck his head
                        and keep cm counting. He never would let anybody give him a blue eye on account that would interfere with counting the house and getting the riggers exact.</ab>
                    <ab>Wunst I heard him talking to a feller who was giving him a calling down and saying: Come on and fight. Abie." And Abie said right beck to him: "I ain't finished counting the
                        gellery yet, but when I do I will hit you a good smesh on the chin."</ab>
                    <ab>And sure enough I heard Abie talking to himseluf and saying: - There is one thousand and eighty-two dollars in that gellery. and the promotioner told me it wouldn't bold more
                        than seven hundred dollars. He is a swindler, and I will have his life. I got to hurry up the fight because I am not giving him eight rounds of box fighting for two rounds of
                        gate reseats."</ab>
                    <ab>Then Abie reached out the right hand and hit the other box fighter on the chin. He didn't even stop to hear the reverie counting him out on account he wanted to meet the
                        promotioner outside and have him count the house over. I think that Abie Atell was the smartest business man that they ever had in the box fighting business. Maybe he was too
                        smart. It is sometimes so that a feller could be too smart for his own good. I am so smart myseluf that sometimes it really gets me worried.</ab>
                    <ab>It is too bad nobody knows who is the fellers that inwentioned the gate reseats.</ab>

                    <ab>If did they would have a stature of him in every baseballing fectory and box fighting arena in the country, or if they wouldn't they oughter. You could get a stature done
                        pretty cheap by any of those Eyetaiian fellers, which only the other dav one of them offered to sell me three for a dollar, but they wasn't statures of anybodv which I
                        knew.</ab>
                    <ab>You could pitcher for yourseluf the scene how it was when the -ate reseats was first inwentioned. A lot of fellers is in a field box fighting and basebailing, and the customers
                        is watching them for nothing. Then this smart feller comes aksing and he gives a look and he sees all the customers and nobody is charging them nothing.</ab>
                    <ab>Of course he must have been a feller from Russia, because that is where all the good business ideers like letting an oitermobile hit you and then suing somebody comes from. He
                        is standing there thinking with the brains that is under his derby het. Finally he gets a option on a lot of lumber and he builds it a fence around the field where is the
                        baseballing and the box fighting, and he sends his brother Moe out to collection from the customers at the gate.</ab>
                    <ab>At foist the customers puts up a holler. Customers would always holler a little until they get used to it. After a while they wouldn't holler at all. They would walk right up
                        to the gate and get sore if you wouldn't take their money. Why, you could even read about fellers suing a theayter for not taking their money.</ab>
                    <ab>That is really how sports got to be a business and why they developed such smart box fighters like Benneh Leonard and Chack Dempsey, and basebailing fellers like Chon McGraw
                        and Baby Ruthsiein. If it wasn't for the gate reseats there wouldn't be no sports at all in this country. Everybody would be an amachure, and a customer would have nothing at
                        all to do with his money.</ab>
                    <ab>Gate reseats for eferythins is getting bigger and bigger every year. You couldn't see the end of them yet because they haven't really begun to commence starting. You could set
                        gate reseats for anything if you only got the brains. I am betting that I could promotion a cootie race in the Yale Bowl and sell out the house.</ab>
                    <ab>That's why I am sorry that I couldn't told you the name of the feller who inwentioned gate reseats. All I know is that he was a feller from my own people. Also I could say that
                        if he hadn't got the ideer when he did I bet I would have got it myseluf on account you know I am all the time thinking up ideers myseluf.</ab>
