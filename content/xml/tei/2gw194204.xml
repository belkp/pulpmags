                <ab>Two or three months ago you made me a set of the most wonderful teeth I have
                    ever seen in anybody's mouth... you would never know they were false teeth...
                    the day I received these teeth I put them in my mouth and I never take them out
                    other than to wash them.... I eat corn off the cob, hard candies and they never
                    come out unless I pull them out. I tell everyone where I got them and what they
                    cost... I am getting all the patients I can for you, good luck with them all and
                    my teeth are beautiful.</ab>

                <ab>I jumped from $18 a week to $50 -- a Free Book started me toward this GOOD PAY
                    IN RADIO</ab>
                <ab>Here's How I Did It</ab>
                <ab>by S.J.E.</ab>
                <ab>"I had an $18 a week job In a shoe factory, but desired to make more money and
                    con-tinue my education. I read about Radio opportunities and enrolled with the
                    Na-tional Radio Institute."</ab>
                <ab>"The Instruction I received was practi-cal. I was able to earn $5 to $10 a week
                    in spare time servicing Radios. This paid for the N.R.I. Course and led to serv-
                    ice work paying for my college education."</ab>
                <ab>Radio servicing permitted me to attend school and work evenings and week-ends.
                    Upon completing the N.R.I. Course I was made Service Manager at $40 to $50 a
                    week, more than twice my shoe factory wage."</ab>
                <ab>"Later,the N.R.I. Graduate Service De-partment sent me to Station KWCR as a
                    Radio Operator. Now I am Radio Engineer of Station WSUI and connected with
                    Tele-vision Station W9XK."</ab>
                <ab>"The N.R.I. Course took mo out of a low-pay shoe factory job and put me Into
                    Radio at good pay: enabled me to earn funds for a college education. There is a
                    promising fu-ture for thoroughly trained Radio men."</ab>

                <ab>Established 27 Years</ab>
                <ab>Here is a quick way to more pay. Radio offers the chance to make $5, $10 a week
                    extra in spare time a few months from now. There is an increasing demand for
                    full time Radio Technicians and Radio Operators too. Many make $30, $40, $50 a
                    week. On top of increasing civilian Interest in Radio, the Radio Industry is
                    rushing to fill hun-dreds of millions of dollars worth of Govern-ment Orders.

                    opportunities.</ab>
                <ab>Why Many Radio Technicians I Train Make $30, $40, $50 a Week</ab>
                <ab>The 832 broadcasting stations in the U. S. employ thousands of Radio Technicians
                    with starting pay among the country's best paid industries. Repairing,
                    servicing, selling home and auto Radio receivers (there are over 80,000,000 in
                    use) gives good Jobs to thou-sands. Many other Radio Technicians take advantage
                    of the opportunities to have their own service or retail Radio businesses. Think
                    of the many good pay jobs in con-nection with Aviation, Commercial, Police Radio
                    and Public Address Systems. N. R. I. gives you the required knowledge of Radio
                    for these Jobs. N. R. I. trains you to be ready when Television opens new jobs.
                    Yes, Radio Technicians make good money be-cause they use their heads as well as
                    their hands. They must be trained. Many are getting special ratings in the Army
                    and Navy; extra rank and pay.</ab>
                <ab>Beginners Quickly Learn to Earn $5, $10 a Week Extra In Spare Time</ab>
                <ab>Nearly every neighborhood offers oppor-tunities for a good part-time Radio Tech-
                    nician to make extra money fixing Radio sets. I give you special training to
                    show you how to start cashing in on these op-portunities early. You get Radio
                    parts and instructions for building test equipment, for conducting experiments
                    that give you valu-able practical experience. You also get a modern Professional
                    Radio Servicing Instru-ment. My fifty-fifty method--half working with Radio
                    parts, half studying my lesson texts--makes learning Radio at home in-teresting,
                    fascinating, practical.</ab>

                <ab>THOUSANDS OF MEN ARE NOW PUSHING YOU UP TO PROMOTION AND HIGHER PAY</ab>
                <ab>Never before have you faced the opportunity you have today.</ab>
                <ab>Millions of men are going to work in expanded plants, and offices in new
                    industries. They must have supervision, there will be thousands of new
                    super-visory and executive job. Authorities agree that there is a shortage of
                    men for these advanced jobs.</ab>
                <ab>The industries haven't time to train all these executives — they must locate
                    many men already prepared and capa-ble. That means you — if you are ready or
                    will get ready quickly.</ab>
                <ab>These supervisory jobs will be of every kind — office, plant, accounting,
                    traffic, legal, secretarial — they will oc-cur everywhere. They will be in new
                    defense plants, in plants expanded to handle defense orders, and in ordinary
                    product plants (because many men will go from these to, the defense plants or
                    into military service).</ab>
                <ab>Obviously, too, this demand will continue to grow for some time to come.</ab>
                <ab>The men who act most quickly will get the most advantage from this un-
                    paralleled opportunity. They will be shoved up most quickly and fartthest.</ab>
                <ab>LaSalle training fits this situation ex-actly. It is supervisory, executive
                    training. It is condensed, practical; you study methods and apply them to
                    typical busi-ness problems. It is spare-time training — take it as fast as your
                    time permits. You need not wait until you have finished it — what you study
                    tonight, you can use on the job tomorrow. Employ-ers know of LaSalle training —
                    welcome the LaSalle trained men.</ab>

                <ab>FOOT ITCH</ab>
                <ab>Athlete's Foot</ab>
                <ab>PAY NOTHING TILL RELIEVED</ab>
                <ab>Send Coupon</ab>
                <ab>At least 50% of the adult population of the United States are being attacked by
                    the disease known as Athlete's Foot.</ab>
                <ab>Usually the disease starts between the toes. Little watery blisters form, and
                    the skin cracks and peels. After a while, the itching becomes intense, and you
                    feel as though you would like to scratch off all the skin.</ab>
                <ab>Beware of It Spreading</ab>
                <ab>Often the disease travels all over the bot- tom of the feet. The soles of your
                    feet be- come red and swollen. The skin also cracks and peels, and the itching
                    becomes worse and worse.</ab>
                <ab>Get relief from this disease as quickly as possible because it is both
                    contagious and in- fectious, and it may go to your hands or even to the under
                    arm or crotch of the legs.</ab>
                <ab>WHY TAKE CHANCES?</ab>
                <ab>The germ that causes the disease is known as Tinea Trichophyton. It buries
                    itself deep in the tissues of the skin and is very hard to kill. A test made
                    shows it takes 15 minutes of boiling to destroy the germ, whereas, upon contact,
                    labora- tory tests show that H. F. will kill the germ Tinea Trichophyton within
                    15 seconds.</ab>
                <ab>H. F. was developed solely for the pur- pose of relieving Athlete's Foot. It is
                    a liquid that penetrates and dries quickly. You just paint the affected parts.
                    H. F. gently peels the skin, which enables it to get to parasites which exist
                    under the outer cuticle.</ab>
                <ab>Itching Often Relieved Quickly</ab>
                <ab>As soon as you apply H. F. you may find that the itching is relieved. You
                    should paint the infected part with H. F. nightly until your feet are better.
                    Usu- ally this takes from three to ten days.</ab>
                <ab>H. F. should leave the skin soft and smooth. You may marvel at the quick way it
                    brings you relief. It costs you nothing to try, so if you are troubled with
                    Athlete's Foot why wait a day longer ?</ab>

                    <ab>—Who became "The World's Most Perfectly Developed Man"</ab>
                    <ab>"I'll prove that YOU too can be a NEW MAN!"</ab>
                    <ab>Charles Atlas</ab>
                    <ab>I KNOW, myself, what it means to have the kind of body that people pity! Of
                        course, you wouldn't know it to look at me now, but I was once a skinny
                        weakling who weighed only 97 lbs.! I was ashamed to strip for sports or
                        undress for a swim. I was such a poor specimen of physical development that
                        I was constantly self-conscious and embarrassed. And I felt only
                        HALF-ALIVE.</ab>
                    <ab>Then I discovered "Dynamic Tension." It gave me a body that won for me the
                        title "World's Most Perfectly Developed Man."</ab>
                    <ab>When I say I can make you over into a man of giant power and energy, I know
                        what I'm talking about. I've seen my new system, "Dynamic Tension" transform
                        hundreds of weak puny men into Atlas Champions.</ab>
                    <ab>Only 15 Minutes a Day</ab>
                    <ab>Do you want big, broad shoulders—a fine, powerful chest— biceps like steel
                        —arms and legs rippling with muscular strength —a stomach ridged with bands
                        of sinewy muscle and a build you can be proud of? Then just give me the
                        opportunity to prove that "Dynamic Tension" is what you need.</ab>
                    <ab>No "ifs," "ands," or "maybes." Just tell me where you want handsome,
                        powerful muscles. Are you fat and flabby? Or skinny and gawky? Are you
                        short-winded, pepless? Do you hold back and let others walk off with the
                        prettiest girls, best jobs, etc.? Then write for details about "Dynamic
                        Tension" and learn how I can make you a healthy, confident, powerful
                        HE-MAN.</ab>
                    <ab>"Dynamic Tension" is an entirely NATURAL method. Only 15 minutes of your
                        spare time daily is enough to show amazing results—and it's actually fun!
                        "Dynamic Tension" does the work.</ab>
