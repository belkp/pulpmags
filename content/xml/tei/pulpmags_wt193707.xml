                    <ab>Because of the many requests for back issues of WEIRD TALES, the publishers do their best to keep a sufficient supply on hand
                        to meet all demands. This magazine was established early in 1923 and there has been a steady drain on the supply of back
                        copies ever since. At present, we have the following back numbers on hand for sale:</ab>

                        <ab>A new and revolutionary religious teaching based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the Galilean Carpenter, and
                            designed to show how we may find, understand and use the same identical power which Jesus used in performing His so-
                            called Miracles," is attracting world wide attention to its founder, Dr. Frank B. Robinson, noted psychologist, author and
                            lecturer.</ab>
                        <ab>"Psychiana," this new psychological religion, believes and teaches that it is today possible for every normal human being,
                            understanding spiritual law as Christ understood it, "to duplicate every work that the Carpenter of Galilee ever did"—it
                            believes and teaches that when He said, "the things that I do shall ye do also." He meant what He said and meant it
                            literally to all mankind, through all the ages.</ab>
                        <ab>Dr. Robinson has prepared a 6000 word treatise on "Psychiana," in which he tells about his long search for the Truth, how
                            he finally came to the full realization of an Unseen Power or force so dynamic in itself that all other powers and forces
                            fade into insignificance beside it"—how he learned to commune directly with the Living God, using this mighty,
                            never-tailing power to demonstrate health, happiness and financial success, and how any normal being may find and use it
                            as Jesus did He is now offering this treatise free to every reader of this magazine who writes him.</ab>

                    <ab>SANDERSON'S big brown hands fumbled as he tugged and strained at the flooring. He felt suddenly hot and weak. There was a
                        flurry in his brain. Still on his knees, he gathered up his tools.</ab>
                    <ab>He rattled and banged things about, trying to shut out other sounds . . . sounds on the stairs. . . .</ab>
                    <ab>The breath seemed to stop in his big body.</ab>
                    <ab>Creak. Creak. Creak.</ab>
                    <ab>It was someone cautiously stealing downstairs.</ab>
                    <ab>Crack!</ab>
                    <ab>He knew that sound. It was the broken step, third from the bottom. He tried to call out. It must be that damned oaf, Walter!
                        The fool must have gone to sleep up there.</ab>
                    <ab>His hunted eyes sought the window. Power to move, to jump for it, had left him. He knelt there, powerful shoulders hunched,
                        hands on the floor for support, crouched like a big frightened animal. He fought to prevent himself looking over his shoulder
                        at the door behind him. He knew it was opening. He heard stealthy fingers on the old loose knob. He heard the harsh scrape of
                        wood on wood as the sagging door was pushed back.</ab>
                    <ab>Ice-cold wind blew in, rustled bits of paper and shavings on the floor.</ab>
                    <ab>Sanderson's head jerked back to look. The door stood widely open. His eyes, filmed with terror, focussed achingly on the gap
                        between door and wall. Darkness moved there. A Thing of Darkness. On the threshold it bulked in shapeless moving menace.
                        Darkness made visible . . . blotting out everything . . . blotting out life itself. . . .</ab>
                    <ab>You will not want to miss this compelling novelette, which will hold your fascinated in- terest to the last word. It is the
                        story of a Thing—a Thing of horror and darkness—a de- stroying ravening Thing that brought death to Troon House. It will be
