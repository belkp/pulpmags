                    <ab>The Best Diamond Bargains in 75 Years</ab>
                    <ab>Never, in nearly 3/4 of a cen tury in business have we offered such amazing bargains as against pre-vailing prices. Due to
                        very unusual con-ditions this old diamond banking house, rated at more than $1,000,000.00 has been making additional thousands
                        of loans on high grade jewels. Hence we have many unpaid loans which we offer to sell at once away below market prices.</ab>
                    <ab>Why Pay Full Prices</ab>
                    <ab>We send any diamond, or watch, on. approval. Try to match our most excep-tional values for 60% more -- that's our challenge.
                        Here are stronger claims than we make ourselves: Enthusiastic cus-tomers write: "My $45 cluster valued here at $150.00." "The
                        stone I bought of you for $75 I could not duplicate for less than $162.00." Hundreds of letters like these. Names on
                        request.</ab>
                    <ab>Send Coupon for Latest Bargain List</ab>
                    <ab>It is radically different from the ordinary catalog. Every jewel described in detail. The list contains hundreds of bargains
                        in unpaid loans and many other amazing values. Send your name and address in the coupon, or by letter or post card today. You

                        <ab>This clever woman has not a wrinkle upon her face; she has per- fected a marvelous, simple method which brought a
                            wonderful change in her face in a single night. For removing wrinkles and develop-ing the figure, her method is truly
                            wonderfully rapid.</ab>
                        <ab>She made herself the woman she is today and brought about the wonderful change in her appearance in a secret and pleasant
                            manner. Her complexion is as clear and fair as that of a child. She turned her scrawny figure into a beautiful and
                            well-developed form. She had thin, scrawny eye-lashes and eyebrows, which could scarcely be seen, and she made them long,
                            thick and beautiful by her own methods and re- moved every blackhead and pimple from her face in a single night.</ab>
                        <ab>Nothing is taken into the stomach, no common massage, no harm-ful plasters, no worthless creams.</ab>
                        <ab>By her new process, she removes wrinkles and develops the whole figure plump and fat.</ab>
                        <ab>It is simply astonishing the hundreds of women who write in re-garding the wonderful results from this new beauty
                            treatment, which is beautifying their face and form after beauty doctors and other methods failed. She has thousands of
                            letters on file like the following:</ab>
                        <ab>Mrs. M. L. B. Albin, Miss., writes: "I have used your beauty treatment with wonderful success. I have not a wrinkle on my
                            face now and it is also improving my complexion, which has al-ways troubled me with pimples and blackheads. My weight was
                            112 pounds before taking your treatment and now I weigh 117, a gain of 5 pounds. Your treatment is a God send to all thin
                            women. I am so grateful you may even use my letter if you wish."</ab>

                        <ab>And you will not be satisfied unless you earn steady pro- motion. But are you prepared for the job ahead of you? Do you
                            measure up to the standard that insures success? For a more responsible position a fairly good education is necessary. To
                            write a sensible business letter, to prepare estimates, to figure cost and to compute interest, you must have a certain
                            amount of preparation. All this you must be able to do before you will earn promotion, Many business houses hire no men
                            whose general know-ledge is not equal to a high school course. Why? Because big business refuses to burden itself with men
                            who are barred from promotion by the lack of elementary education.</ab>
                        <ab>Can You Qualify for a Better Position</ab>
                        <ab>We have a plan whereby you can. We can give you a com-plete but simplified high school course in two years, giving you all
                            the essentials that form the foundation of practical business. It will prepare you to hold your own where competition is
                            keen and exacting. Do not doubt your abili-ty, but make up your mind to it and you will soon have the requirements that
                            will bring you success and big money. YOU CAN DO IT.</ab>
                        <ab>Let us show you how to get on the road to success. It will not cost you a single working hour. We are so sure of be-ing
                            able to help you that we will cheerfully return to you, at the end of ten lessons,every cent you sent us if you are not
