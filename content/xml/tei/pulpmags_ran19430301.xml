                    <ab>You're in the Army now, You're not behind the plow, While doing the hitch Fight flakes and itch</ab>
                    <ab>IT MAY BE Infectious Dandruff</ab>
                    <ab>Get After it Now With Listerine</ab>
                    <ab>That's a swell treatment whether you're in the Service or out, whether you're a man or a woman. It's the tested treatment that
                        has helped so many to control this troublesome condition.</ab>
                    <ab>Kills "Bottle Bacillus"</ab>
                    <ab>Just douse Listerine Antiseptic on scalp and hair twice daily and follow with vigorous and persist- ent massage. What
                        coolness! What freshness! And what germ-killing power!</ab>
                    <ab>The minute Listerine Antiseptic hits the scalp it starts to kill millions of germs accompanying infec- tious dandruff
                        including the "bottle bacillus." This ugly little customer is held, by numerous dermatolo- gists, to be a causative agent of
                        infectious dandruff.</ab>
                    <ab>Don't Delay. Start Now!</ab>
                    <ab>After a few treatments you'll be delighted to see how quickly flakes and scales, inflammation and itching begin to disappear.
                        That is what 76% of dan- druff sufferers found in a carefully supervised test.</ab>
                    <ab>If you have any of these symptoms don't delay. Start now. Remember, the infectious type of dan- druff is a germ infection and,
                        naturally, calls for germ-killing treatment. Remember, Listerine is the same antiseptic that has been famous for more than 50
                        years in the field of oral hygiene.</ab>

                    <ab>Dear Mom: One of the things I miss most in Camp is that good old Listerine Tooth Paste that does such a nifty job of cleansing
                        and make your mouth feel so clean. For Pete's sake, mail me a tube- The Post Exchange is sold out.</ab>

                    <ab>Broadcasting Stations employ N. R. I. trained Radio Technicians as operators, installation maintenance men and in other

                    <ab>"I repaired some Radio sets when I was on my tenth lesson. I really don't see how you can give so much for such a small amount
                        of money. I made $600 in a year and a half, and I have made an aver-age of $10 a week -- just spare time."--JOHN JERRY, 1337

                        today of trained Radio Technicians and Operators. If you're in a rut, wor-ried because your present job will not last -- find
                        out about RADIO!</ab>

                    <ab>Right now, probably in your neigh-borhood, there's room for more spare and full time Radio Technicians. The Radio repair
                        business is booming, be-cause no new Radios are being made. Many Radio Technicians are starting their own FULL time Radio
                        busi-nesses . . . making 330, $40, $50 a week.</ab>

                        Modulation, and other Radio develop-ments will open after the war! I give you the Radio knowledge re-quired for jobs in these
                        fields.</ab>

                    <ab>FOR every word that has left the lips of bishops or states-men to enlighten man, a thousand have been withheld. For every book
                        publicly exposed to the inquiring mind, one hundred more have been suppressed--damned to oblivion. Each year of progress has
                        been wilfully delayed centuries. Wisdom has had to filter through biased, secret sessions or ecclesiastical council meetings,
                        where high dignitaries of state and church alone proclaimed what man should know.</ab>
                    <ab>Are you prepared to demand the hidden facts of life? Will you continue to believe that you are not capable of weighing the
                        worth of knowledge that concerns your personal freedom and happiness? Realize that much that can make your life more
                        understandable and livable has been left unexplained or intentionally destroyed. At first by word of mouth only, and now by
                        private discourses, are revealed those truths which secret brotherhoods preserved in ancient temples and hidden sanctuaries,
                        from those who sought to selfishly deprive hu- manity of them.</ab>

                    </ab>
                    <ab>Girl of Pisces--Feb. 19-March 21</ab>

                        <ab>BORN under a benign and gentle sign, the Girl of Pisces seems always to be serene, but this outward show of serenity
                            conceals a volatile, temperamental nature. She is sensi- tively fond of art and beauty, and her capac- ity for detail
                            inclines her to the more deli- cate things of life.</ab>
                        <ab>She makes an excellent homemaker, a fine designer of clothes, a conscientious com- munity worker. Her large sympathies and
                            her strong beliefs make her invaluable in the war effort. She would excell in nursery work, that is attending the children
                            of defense- working mothers. She has a natural way with children, and they respond to her quiet charm. Too, she would make
                            a sympathetic nurse, and Pisces, meaning the Sign of the Two Fish, gives her a nautical leaning, and often brings her
                            extensive travels. Invari- ably she is endowed with exquisite grace.</ab>
                    </div>
                    <div type="column">
                        <cb n="02"/>
                        <ab>Being cautious by nature, and even in- clined to be somewhat wary and afraid of big chances, the Pisces girl has good
                            control of her own heart. When she chooses her mate, she knows exactly what she is doing, and seldom falls into the
                            emotional traps that await her more impetuous sisters.</ab>
                        <ab>Perhaps her most enviable trait is her abil- ity to adjust herself to sudden changes in environment. She need have no
                            fears about changing her pattern of life; she will be able always to leave one mode of life and enter happily upon
                            another--a gift which makes her particularly valuable to her country in these days of sudden changes of life and oc-
                            cupation.</ab>
                        <ab>Being almost tireless, her energy and her enthusiasm for whatever she is doing may be excessive and--a word of caution--she
                            must learn not to overdo.</ab>

                    <ab>Here's the Kind of MEN I Build!</ab>
                    <ab>J.G. O'BRIEN Atlas Cup Winner</ab>
                    <ab>This is an ordi-nary snapshot of one of Charles Atlas' Califor-nia pupils.</ab>
                    <ab>Will You Let Me PROVE I Can Make YOU a NEW Man?</ab>
                    <ab>I DON'T care how old or young you are, or how ashamed of your present physical condition you may be. If you can simply raise
                        your arm and flex it I can add SOLID MUSCLE to your biceps- yes, on each arm- in doubl-quick time! Only 15 minutes a day-
                        right in your own home-is all the time I ask of you! And there's no cost if I fail.</ab>
                    <ab>I can broaden your shoulders, strengthen your back, develop your whole muscluar system INSIDE and OUTSIDE! I can add inches to
                        your chest, give you a vise-like grip, make those legs of yours lithe and powerful. I can shoot new strength into your old
                        backbone, exercise those inner organs, help you cram your body so full of pep, vigor and red-blooded vitality that you won't
                        feel there's even "standing room" left for weakness and that lazy feeling! Before I get through with you I'll have your whole
                        frame "measured" to a nice, new, beautiful suit of muscle!</ab>
                    <ab>What's My Secret?</ab>
                    <ab>"Dynamic Tension!" That's the ticket! The iden-tical natural method that I myself developed to change my body from the
                        scrawny, skinny-chested weakling I was at 17 to my present super-man physique! Thou-sands of other fellows are becoming
                        marvelous phys-ical specimens- my way. I give you no gadgets or contraptions to fool with. When you have learned to develop
                        your strength through "Dynamic Tension" you can laugh at artificial msucle makers. You simply utilze the DORMANT muscle-power
                        in your own God-given body- watch it increase and multiply double-quick into real, solid LIVE MUSCLE.</ab>
                    <ab>Only 15 Minutes a Day</ab>
                    <ab>My method- "Dynamic Tension"- will turn the trick for you. No theory-every excerise is practical. And, man, so easy! Spend
                        only 15 minutes a day in your own home. From the very start you'll be using my method of "Dynamic Tension" almost
                        unconsciously every minute of the day- walking, bending voer, etc.- to BUILD MUSCLE and VITALITY.</ab>
