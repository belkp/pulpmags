                                    <span type="columnLine">perfectly still. "It did happen, after all," he said.</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">"And 'ow I'm to explain it I don't know." He sighed</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">heavily, and began feeling in his pockets for a</span>

                                    <span type="columnLine">were possible even with matches. He extended a</span>

                                    <span type="columnLine">up hastily, and it went out. His perception of pos-</span>
                                    <span type="columnLine">sibilities enlarged, and he felt for and replaced the</span>

                                    <ab>America is an advertising nation. That is one reason why the man with moderate means here enjoys more comforts

                                          muscle restorative called "Plapao" constantly in contact with the affected muscles. No straps, buckles or
                                          obnoxious springs attached. When adhering closely to the body all grinding pressure is obviated;
                                          furthermore, slipping is impossible, so cannot chafe or press against the bone. Soft as velvet—easy to
                                          apply—inexpensive. In use by thousands for twenty years—most obsti- nate ruptures reported conquered in
                                          privacy of the home without hindrance from work. Awarded Gold Medal, Rome; Grand Prix, Paris; and honorable

                                          trusses. Stop wasting time and money on old-fashioned trusses; close the hernial open- ing as Nature
                                          intended, so the rupture can't come down. It will cost nothing to test the PLAPAO—send no money, just the
