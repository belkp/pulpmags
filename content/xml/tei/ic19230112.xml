                    <ab>Richard Barthelmess a few years ago was Lillian Gish's leading man, at the time he created the notable role of the Chinese boy
                        in "Broken Blossoms," Griffith's vivid photoplay made from Thomas Burke Limehouse's story, "The Chink and the Child."</ab>
                    <ab>Today he is starring in Inspiration Pic- tures, and Dorothy Gish is his leading woman. Their first picture together again is
                        "Fury," but so popular are both of these artists of the silver screen that the question of which is star and which lead is
                        relatively unimportant. The public is now looking forward to "The Bright Shawl," for with such principals Joseph
                        Hergesheimer's story should prove as popular on the silver screen as it did in novel form.</ab>

                        <title>Are You a Lloyd Fan?</title>
                    </ab>
                    <ab>This is Harold Lloyd as he appears in "Doctor Jack," his latest picture, with the beautifully blond Mildred Davis.</ab>
                    <ab>If you are a Lloyd fan—as doubtless you are—you would find Harold Lloyd all you had expected if you met him in real life.</ab>
                    <ab>But one thing would be different.</ab>
                    <ab>They told me, "Mr. Lloyd is in there," and I entered a room in Pathe's office and looked all around, and then my eyes rested
                        on a slender, smiling young man whose rather darkish, rather sensitive features bore out something of the Celtic in his name,
                        though absolutely nothing of that "gets over" in the Harold Lloyd we all know on the screen. And of course he did not wear the
                        glasses that are such a familiar part of his comedies.</ab>
                    <ab>Harold Lloyd, when told he didn't look much like himself in real life, admitted it was a fact that afforded him much amusement
                        in Hollywood. For instance, he can drop into any motion picture house where one of his comedies is being shown and hear
                        everybody's comments on himself and his work, without anybody's sus- pecting that he is among those present.</ab>
                    <ab>He tells of an amusing incident in this connection. Once, in a spirit of off</ab>

                    </ab>
                    <ab>screen comedy, he applied to Dorothy Gish, for a job as "extra." Quite kindly and patiently Miss Gish explained to him that he
                        did not look Italian enough for the part—and all the time, at the back of the room, a friend of Mr. Lloyd's was doubling with
                        laughter, while Harold Lloyd gravely prolonged the scene as long as possible.</ab>
                    <ab>Another thing you would note at once in Mr. Lloyd, if you talked with him only a few minutes, is his way of chatting easily
                        and pleasantly on almost any subject except himself—New York high buildings and slow traffic; his admiration for Mary
                        Pickford; his conception of the masculine lead in "The Tailor-Made Man," which he thinks should show "the irrepressible spirit
                        to 'carry on,' " that would make itself felt even in the company of people already unfavorably prejudiced and all prepared to
                        be antagonistic. And his conception of this role gives you a good picture of the personality of Mr. Lloyd.</ab>
                    <ab>He confesses that he likes dancing, and dances a great deal, that his regulation attire consists of patent leather oxfords,
                        navy blue suit, black tie, and white shirt; that the comedies that made him famous were made in two or three days for each
                        picture, one picture following another without interruption. After weeks of this, Harold Lloyd will tell you, they had to rest
                        awhile, because they were oversupplied. It doesn't occur to him that rest was necessary after those strenuous weeks.</ab>
                    <ab>He bids you good-by with that characteristic smile, head thrown back and a glint of teeth. And you take away the impression
                        that Harold Lloyd is keenly interested in everybody; that he considers each opinion offered, never voicing dissent, but
                        carefully weighing each viewpoint offered him.</ab>

                    <ab>Those who knew Marie Lloyd, the music hall artist who died recently, assert she earned more money in the course of her career
                        than any other actress, not excluding Sarah Bernhardt. Her market value, so to speak, in the music halls was as high when she
                        died as at any time in her life, and, normally, she earned anywhere from 200 to 500 pounds a week.</ab>
                    <ab>Her generosity was something fabulous. She gave away hundreds of pounds as other people give away shillings, It is said she
                        kept a long list of pensioners to whom she gave a fixed sum each week, keeping a big bag of silver for that purpose. Arid she
                        died practically penniless.</ab>

                    </ab>
                    <ab>During this year of 1922 which has just slipped behind us, you, the readers, have made it possible for us to put considerably
                        more copies of this magazine on the newsstands all over the country—just by liking—and buying it.</ab>
                    <ab>So it doesn't seem fair—does it?—to have a contest without letting our readers take part in it.</ab>
                    <ab>So, for this coming year we want you to keep sending in your letters of about one hundred words, telling us which stories you
                        like and why. For all letters that are published we will pay at space rates, or even slightly more, if they are unusually
                        good. That means that for a letter of about one hundred words, written just as if you were talking to a neighbor, you will
                        receive a dollar or more. We plan to use four or five letters in each issue. And any reader can send as many letters as he
                        likes.</ab>
                    <ab>Won't you try for one of these prizes?</ab>

                    <ab>of stories in this magazine, we will award during this coming year four prizes of fifty dollars each—in addition of course to
                        payment at usual rates on acceptance.</ab>
                    <ab>We want stories of the kind of people you know best— whether they are crooks, or society people, or farmers in the Middle
                        West. We want stories that show life as it is lived in any particular section of the United States—as, for instance, "The
                        Untimely Tornado," in the last number, which pictures life on a "dry" farm in the far West. And of course we want stories that
                        portray the emotions of real people—who love, hate, hope, fear, despair or triumph, as the case may be.</ab>
                    <ab>Any person who can tell a good story that has the ring of real life to it can compete. This contest is not by any means
                        limited to trained writers.</ab>
                    <ab>And we hope, and feel sure, that those who read and those who write will help us make this magazine better than ever this year
                        of 1923.</ab>

                    <ab>Pam has run away to go in the movies.</ab>
                    <ab>Ted Bromley, a chance acquaintance, has painted a glowing picture for her of what the future may hold, once she reaches the
                        studios.</ab>
                    <ab>Her case is different from that of the usual movie-struck girl only in that she is the daughter of stage people. And she has a
                        further motive for going—to escape Mark, whom she is being forced to marry in order to keep her grandfather's modest estate
                        all in the family.</ab>
                    <ab>She is a little afraid to go away with Ted—but she does. He behaves toward her with the utmost consideration. But their train
                        is wrecked.</ab>
                    <ab>A woman in a near by farmhouse takes Pam in, and asks the name of her people, in order to write them. Pam is terrified—maybe
                        she'll have to go back, and marry Mark.</ab>
                    <ab>Adam, the son of the house, slips in and tells her that her cousin has arrived—is in the front room. He wants to run away with
                        Pam: asks her to marry him. Pam catches the trolley, just in time to escape Adam— as well as her disagreeable Cousin
                        Martha.</ab>
                    <ab>She works in a neighboring town, until she saves money enough to reach New York. She goes to a studio just across the river,
                        and is given a chance for Ted Bromley's sake. Everybody speaks of him in the past tense—especially Gloria Mundi, the star, who
                        after Pam has innocently spoiled a scene for her, demands that the new "extra" be discharged.</ab>
                    <ab>Bryam Hogan, the chief, however, keeps Pam.</ab>
                    <ab>One day she learns Ted Bromley is still living—though he has an injured spine that affects his sight and also his
                        understanding.</ab>
                    <ab>She takes a room adjoining his, in order to take care of him. The landlady tells her he will not last long.</ab>

                        <ab>Thousands upon thou- sands of women to-day marry with the bloom of youth upon their cheeks. A few years of married life
                            rub the bloom off. Children come, too many. And instead of the energetic, healthy girl we have a tired and bedraggled
                            young-old woman. Why do women allow marriage, the holy thing, to work this wicked transformation?</ab>
                        <ab>MARGARET SANGER, the acknowledged world leader of the Birth Control movement and President of the American Birth Control
                            League, has the answer for this most momen- tous problem of womankind. Every married woman knows only too well the
                            tragedies result- ing from ignorance of birth control.</ab>
                        <ab>Why should a woman sacrifice her love-life — a posses- sion she otherwise uses every resource to keep? Why does she give

                        <ab>garet Sanger gives to the women of the world the knowledge she dared to print—the knowledge for which she faced jail and
                            fought through every court to establish as woman's inalienable right to know.</ab>
                        <ab>In "Woman and the New Race" she shows how woman can and will rise above the forces that, in too many cases, have ruined
                            her beauty through the ages—that still drag her down to-day—that wreck her mental and physical strength—that disqualify
                            her for society, for self-improvement—that finally shut her out from the thing she cherishes most: her husband's
                            love.</ab>
                        <ab>In blazing this revolutionary trail to the new freedom of women, this daring and heroic author points, out that women who
                            cannot afford to have more than one or two chil- dren, should not do so. It is a crime to herself, a crime to her
                            children, a crime to society. And now for the first time Mrs. Sanger shows the way out. And she brings to the women of the
                            world the greatest message it has been their good fortune to receive.</ab>
