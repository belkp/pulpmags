                    <ab>I jumped from $18 a week to $50 -- a Free Book started me toward this GOOD PAY IN RADIO</ab>
                    <ab>Here's How I Did It</ab>
                    <ab>by S.J.E.</ab>
                    <ab>"I had an $18 a week job In a shoe factory, but desired to make more money and con-tinue my education. I read about Radio opportunities and enrolled with the Na-tional Radio
                        Institute."</ab>
                    <ab>"The Instruction I received was practi-cal. I was able to earn $5 to $10 a week in spare time servicing Radios. This paid for the N.R.I. Course and led to serv- ice work paying
                        for my college education."</ab>
                    <ab>Radio servicing permitted me to attend school and work evenings and week-ends. Upon completing the N.R.I. Course I was made Service Manager at $40 to $50 a week, more than
                        twice my shoe factory wage."</ab>
                    <ab>"Later,the N.R.I. Graduate Service De-partment sent me to Station KWCR as a Radio Operator. Now I am Radio Engineer of Station WSUI and connected with Tele-vision Station
                        W9XK."</ab>
                    <ab>"The N.R.I. Course took mo out of a low-pay shoe factory job and put me Into Radio at good pay: enabled me to earn funds for a college education. There is a promising fu-ture
                        for thoroughly trained Radio men."</ab>

                    <ab>Established 27 Years</ab>
                    <ab>Here is a quick way to more pay. Radio offers the chance to make $5, $10 a week extra in spare time a few months from now. There is an increasing demand for full time Radio
                        Technicians and Radio Operators too. Many make $30, $40, $50 a week. On top of increasing civilian Interest in Radio, the Radio Industry is rushing to fill hun-dreds of
                        millions of dollars worth of Govern-ment Orders. Clip the coupon below and mail it. Find out how I train you for these opportunities.</ab>
                    <ab>Why Many Radio Technicians I Train Make $30, $40, $50 a Week</ab>
                    <ab>The 832 broadcasting stations in the U. S. employ thousands of Radio Technicians with starting pay among the country's best paid industries. Repairing, servicing, selling home
                        and auto Radio receivers (there are over 80,000,000 in use) gives good Jobs to thou-sands. Many other Radio Technicians take advantage of the opportunities to have their own
                        service or retail Radio businesses. Think of the many good pay jobs in con-nection with Aviation, Commercial, Police Radio and Public Address Systems. N. R. I. gives you the
                        required knowledge of Radio for these Jobs. N. R. I. trains you to be ready when Television opens new jobs. Yes, Radio Technicians make good money be-cause they use their heads
                        as well as their hands. They must be trained. Many are getting special ratings in the Army and Navy; extra rank and pay.</ab>
                    <ab>Beginners Quickly Learn to Earn $5, $10 a Week Extra In Spare Time</ab>
                    <ab>Nearly every neighborhood offers oppor-tunities for a good part-time Radio Tech- nician to make extra money fixing Radio sets. I give you special training to show you how to
                        start cashing in on these op-portunities early. You get Radio parts and instructions for building test equipment, for conducting experiments that give you valu-able practical
                        experience. You also get a modern Professional Radio Servicing Instru-ment. My fifty-fifty method--half working with Radio parts, half studying my lesson texts--makes learning
                        Radio at home in-teresting, fascinating, practical.</ab>

                        Authorities agree that there is a shortage of men for these advanced jobs.</ab>
                    <ab>The industries haven't time to train all these executives -- they must locate many men already prepared and capa-ble. That means you -- if you are ready or will get ready
                        quickly.</ab>
                    <ab>These supervisory jobs will be of every kind -- office, plant, accounting, traffic, legal, secretarial -- they will oc-cur everywhere. They will be in new defense plants, in
                        plants expanded to handle defense orders, and in ordinary product plants (because many men will go from these to, the defense plants or into military service).</ab>
                    <ab>Obviously, too, this demand will continue to grow for some time to come.</ab>
                    <ab>The men who act most quickly will get the most advantage from this un- paralleled opportunity. They will be shoved up most quickly and fartthest.</ab>
                    <ab>LaSalle training fits this situation ex-actly. It is supervisory, executive training. It is condensed, practical; you study methods and apply them to typical busi-ness
                        problems. It is spare-time training -- take it as fast as your time permits. You need not wait until you have finished it -- what you study tonight, you can use on the job
                        tomorrow. Employ-ers know of LaSalle training -- welcome the LaSalle trained men.</ab>

                    <ab>At least 50% of the adult population of the United States are being attacked by the disease known as Athlete's Foot.</ab>
                    <ab>Usually the disease starts between the toes. Little watery blisters form, and the skin cracks and peels. After a while, the itching becomes intense, and you feel as though you
                        would like to scratch off all the skin.</ab>
                    <ab>Beware of It Spreading</ab>
                    <ab>Often the disease travels all over the bot- tom of the feet. The soles of your feet be- come red and swollen. The skin also cracks and peels, and the itching becomes worse and
                        worse.</ab>
                    <ab>Get relief from this disease as quickly as possible because it is both contagious and in- fectious, and it may go to your hands or even to the under arm or crotch of the
                        legs.</ab>
                    <ab>WHY TAKE CHANCES?</ab>
                    <ab>The germ that causes the disease is known as Tinea Trichophyton. It buries itself deep in the tissues of the skin and is very hard to kill. A test made shows it takes 15
                        minutes of boiling to destroy the germ, whereas, upon contact, labora- tory tests show that H. F. will kill the germ Tinea Trichophyton within 15 seconds.</ab>
                    <ab>H. F. was developed solely for the pur- pose of relieving Athlete's Foot. It is a liquid that penetrates and dries quickly. You just paint the affected parts. H. F. gently
                        peels the skin, which enables it to get to parasites which exist under the outer cuticle.</ab>
                    <ab>Itching Often Relieved Quickly</ab>
                    <ab>As soon as you apply H. F. you may find that the itching is relieved. You should paint the infected part with H. F. nightly until your feet are better. Usu- ally this takes
                        from three to ten days.</ab>
                    <ab>H. F. should leave the skin soft and smooth. You may marvel at the quick way it brings you relief. It costs you nothing to try, so if you are troubled with Athlete's Foot why
                        wait a day longer ?</ab>

                    <ab>--Who became "The World's Most Perfectly Developed Man"</ab>
                    <ab>"I'll prove that YOU too can be a NEW MAN!"</ab>
                    <ab>Charles Atlas</ab>
                    <ab>I KNOW, myself, what it means to have the kind of body that people pity! Of course, you wouldn't know it to look at me now, but I was once a skinny weakling who weighed only 97
                        lbs.! I was ashamed to strip for sports or undress for a swim. I was such a poor specimen of physical development that I was constantly self-conscious and embarrassed. And I
                        felt only HALF-ALIVE.</ab>
                    <ab>Then I discovered "Dynamic Tension." It gave me a body that won for me the title "World's Most Perfectly Developed Man."</ab>
                    <ab>When I say I can make you over into a man of giant power and energy, I know what I'm talking about. I've seen my new system, "Dynamic Tension" transform hundreds of weak puny
                        men into Atlas Champions.</ab>
                    <ab>Only 15 Minutes a Day</ab>
                    <ab>Do you want big, broad shoulders--a fine, powerful chest-- biceps like steel --arms and legs rippling with muscular strength --a stomach ridged with bands of sinewy muscle and a
                        build you can be proud of? Then just give me the opportunity to prove that "Dynamic Tension" is what you need.</ab>
                    <ab>No "ifs," "ands," or "maybes." Just tell me where you want handsome, powerful muscles. Are you fat and flabby? Or skinny and gawky? Are you short-winded, pepless? Do you hold
                        back and let others walk off with the prettiest girls, best jobs, etc.? Then write for details about "Dynamic Tension" and learn how I can make you a healthy, confident,
                        powerful HE-MAN.</ab>
                    <ab>"Dynamic Tension" is an entirely NATURAL method. Only 15 minutes of your spare time daily is enough to show amazing results--and it's actually fun! "Dynamic Tension" does the
                        work.</ab>
