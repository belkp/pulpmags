                    <ab rend="p">A few years ago a new and unknown gem stone was accidentally
                        created by <persName role="scientist">M. Verneuil</persName>, the
                        world-famous scientist. His asso-ciates examined the new gem and declared
                        the secret of making diamonds had been discovered. Scientists and jewelers
                        pro-nounced the stone a diamond! Verneuil alone was undeceived. The new gem,
                        he says, flashes like a diamond, and will last forever, but the composition
                        is not identical. This new diamond-like gem stone was given a new
                        nameâ€”Lachnite.</ab>
                    <ab rend="p">Already, over 300,000 Americans wear Lachnites in place of
                        diamonds. The cost being small, they have saved probably over
                        $150,000,000.00. Wherever you go you see Lachnites, though you may not know
                        it!</ab>
                    <ab rend="bold">Lachnites resist diamond tests</ab>
                    <ab rend="p">This chart shows the astounding similarity between Lach-nites and
                        diamonds. They flash with equal brilliance and withstand the same heat and
                        acid tests. No wonder men cannot distinguish them even when they are placed
                        side by side. Note on the chart how common "imitation diamonds" fail to
                        withstand the diamond tests. Buy genuine Lachnites, sold in America only by

                    <ab>SIR CHEVILLE is found dead at the foot of a precipice from which he was
                        apparently hurled. Etherton, a manufacturer, who owed Cheville money, and
                        Mrs. Stanbury, his sister-in-law, who opposed his approaching marriage to a
                        governess because it threatened her son's inheritance, were seen near the
                        scene of the crime by Pike, Etherton's secretary, who tries to use his
                        information to force Letty, Etherton's daughter, to marry him. She is
                        secretly engaged to Marston Stanbury, Cheville's heir, and scorns the
                        clerk's advances. Two documents bearing on the motive of the murder are
                        missing, one from the dead baronet's pocket, is the plan of Etherton's
                        valuable invention, and the other is a will executed on the day of Sir
                        Cheville's death in which he bequeathes 100,000 pounds to his fiancee and
                        the rest of his estate to Marston. Marston's growing suspicion of Birch, Sir
                        Cheville's lawyer and a former lover of the governess, is strengthened by
                        the re-port of a moor ranger who saw the couple many times late at night on
                        the moor, and on the night of the murder in particular. Pike overhears this
                        conversation and pretending to have been an eye witness, demands 5,000
                        pounds of Birch for his silence. Birch, frightened, complies, but Pike who
                        plans to hasten to America is seen entering a steamship office and is
                        detained by the police who suspect him. He pretends to make a full
                        confession, which implicates Birch. Meanwhile, the lost will is found in Sir
                        Cheville's locker. The police go after Birch, who is found with the
                        governess. She frankly confesses they were lovers and had met on the night
                        of the murder for a last good-bye. She further tells of leaving her lover
                        and on her homeward way of passing two men, wearing black masks, coming from
                        the direction of the precipice!</ab>

                    <ab>In a dirty, forlorn shack by the river edge they found the mutilated body of
                        Genevieve Martin. Her pretty face was swollen and distorted. Marks on the
                        slender throat showed that the girl had been brutally choked to death. Who
                        had committed this ghastly crime? No one had seen the girl and her assailant
                        enter the cottage. No one had seen the murderer depart. How could he be
                        brought to justice ? Crimes like this have been solvedâ€”are being solved
                        every dayâ€”by Finger Print Experts. Every day we read in the papers of their
