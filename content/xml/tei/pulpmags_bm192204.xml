                    <ab>Editor's Note. The Black Mask takes pride in presenting herewith what it
                        considers to be not only J. S. Fletcher's masterpiece in mystery writing,
                        but, as well, the best detective novel that has made its appearance since
                        the heyday of Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes. Mr. Fletcher, as is well
                        known, is the greatest living winter of mystery fiction. His earlier novel,
                        "The Middle Temple Murder," made a sensation upon its publication in
                        America. We confidently believe that "Exterior to the Evidence'' will
                        duplicate its success.</ab>
