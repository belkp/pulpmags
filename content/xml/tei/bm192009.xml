                              <ab>is really the latest way to destroy undesirable hair growths. It
                                    is a pure, delightfully scented powder which you easily mix with
                                    a little warm water and apply. The disagreeable odor so
                                    pronounced in some depilatories is entirely absent in Removo. In
                                    three minutes you wash it off and the hair has disappeared. It
                                    will positively not irritate and the skin remains white and
                                    smooth.</ab>

                                          comes from having plenty of iron in the blood, while many
                                          another has gone down to inglorious defeat simply for lack
                                          of iron.</ab>

                                          per-fected a marvelous, simple method which brought a
                                          wonderful change in her face in a single night. For
                                          removing wrinkles and develop-ing the figure, her method

                                    <ab>She made herself the woman she is today and brought about

                                          pleasant manner. Her complexion is as clear and fair as
                                          that of a child. She turned her scrawny figure into a
                                          beautiful and well-developed form. She had thin, scrawny
                                          eye lashes and eyebrows, which could scarcely be seen, and
                                          she made them long, thick and beautiful by her own methods
                                          and re-moved every blackhead and pimple from her face in a

                                    <ab>By her new process, she removes wrinkles and develops the
                                          whole figure plump and fat.</ab>
                                    <ab>It is simply astonishing the hundreds of women who write in
