                        <ab>"I put a Stransky Vaporizer on a Marmon that got only 10 to 11 miles per gallon," writes B. O. Finch. He drove 492 miles and averaged 20 miles per gallon. This amounts to getting half his gasoline free! Read below how it works--how you can test how you can test it without
                            risk -- and how you can make big profits.</ab>

                        <ab>OVER two and a half million car owners have now installed the Stransky Vaporizer--on practically every make of car, truck, or tractor. Many have used it from three to eight years in everyday actual use and still praise the way it has saved them gas, ended carbon and spark
                            plug trouble, and increased the power of their cars.</ab>
                        <ab>The astounding instant results of the Stransky Vaporizer have made big profits for Stransky representatives. It is now one of the few big steady profit propositions in the country. It is nationally advertised and practically every car owner has probably heard about it. It
                            is easy to install and has nothing</ab>

                        <ab>to get out of order. It is a simple piece of metal that fits any oar and is guaranteed harmless in every way. Its principle of saving gasoline is in multiplying the vapor power of the raw Gasoline of which 20 to 30% is wasted by the average car owner, according to
                            authorities.</ab>

                        </ab>
                        <ab>In the days when the horse-thief thrived throughout the Southwest, ranchers and cowmen banded together to form a protective association. They had their hands full in running down the criminals and their loot in the hey-day of the horse-thief. In the early fifties in
                            Missouri the practice of rustling other people's horses became so widespread and was operated on such a successful scale that criminals flocked to the state and the Anti-Horse Thief Association resulted.</ab>
                        <ab>Methods of protection found effective in the Western mining camps were used by the founders of the organization. Major McKee and H. A. Stewart, who were '49ers in the gold days of California. For years after the Civil War when horse thievery flourished, the A. H. T. A.
                            made it hot for members of the rustling clan. Tom King was one of the most notorious and most successful raiders of the period. The society and Federal government tried for some time in vain to curb the activities of this wary criminal. In three years he stole-more
                            animals than any other man. A complete puzzle to his pursuers, he evaded every trap with a marvelous intuition that left them dumfounded.</ab>
                        <ab>The society often protected banks and gradually drifted into a general law enforcement body, spreading through the Southwest and extending east into Illinois, Iowa, and Ohio. In 1908 the Kansas branch of the association spread its field to running down motor thieves.</ab>
                        <ab>But now, just as the motor thief supplanted the horse rustler, so the purloiner of airplanes is pushing out the rustler of motor cars. Several air machine robberies have been reported in the Southwest recently, and the old but nevertheless effective A. H. T. A. will soon
                            be taking up the problem of curtailing the efforts of the new- est brand of thieving criminal.</ab>

                        <ab>Just how unsafe is it?</ab>
                        <ab>The Naval Bureau of Aeronautics has just published figures showing that in the last ten months there were twenty-six fatalities in naval aviation.</ab>
                        <ab>However, in those ten months naval aviators flew 84.478 hours in the air. This means a fatality every 3,249 flying hours.</ab>
                        <ab>Since the average rate of speed is 100 miles an hour, there is one fatality every 324,900 miles flown. This is seventeen and one-half times the distance around the earth.</ab>
                        <ab>Is there any means of travel by which you could go round the world seventeen and a half times without expecting to run into a serious or fatal accident, under the law of averages?</ab>

                        <ab>The Harvard Flying Club has got its ship in the air, and the Travel Air is now flying daily. The story of the club is an interesting one:</ab>
                        <ab>On March 12, 1925, Rodney Jackson organized a group of students in Harvard under the title of "The Harvard Flying Club." At that time, twenty-five men were members of the club, and all but nine have been graduated up to the present time. Much amusement was derived by some
                            individuals at that time because of the fact that the flying club had no means of flying. Last fall Billings came to the rescue, and offered the boys a Travel Air that had been used considerably, at a reduced price. Fred Ames loaned the money to purchase the plane. The
                            ship was taken down, and housed in Gordon McKay laboratory, through the courtesy of Prof. Lionel S. Marks and the Engineering School. In February it was transferred to a garage, and Murray N. Fairbanks began to overhaul it. Crocker Snow gave the ship ten coats of Duco and
                            W. N. Bump re-upholstered the cockpits. Frank Sproul did his part by grinding the valves. On March 9th Sproul and Marks towed the plane to the airport, and Eddie O'Toole rigged her. Billings flight-tested the ship, and pronounced it O. K.</ab>

                        </ab>
                        <ab>Everyone recalls the epic drive of the staunch Gunnar Kasson and his great lead dog, Balto, in their soul-wrenching fight to carry the serum to disease-infested Nome. It was a wonderful battle, with a man and a fighting lead dog pitting their indomitable hearts against
                            the fiercest blizzards of the northern tundra. They well earned the Red Badge of Courage. But such a man-killing, tearing battle will never be necessary again. The airplane has firmly established itself in the snowlands.</ab>
                        <ab>The human-driven hawks of the air have not supplanted the dog teams altogether for ordinary purposes, but where speed is expedient, the planes are in a class alone. Never again will the menace of a fast-spreading epidemic claim a staggering death toll because medical aid
                            is not at hand. Never again will whole communities be besieged by a scourge of disease that runs rampant for weeks before proper preventatives can be had.</ab>
                        <ab>Much of the interior of Alaska has been opened up to air flight by the establishment of landing fields which stretch from Fort Yukon to Nome. Within another six months twenty-five air bases will be constructed with appropriations made by the last territorial
                            legislation.</ab>
                        <ab>Fairbanks, the operating base of many planes that fly to the outlying districts, is but nine days travel from Seattle by rail and water. Most of the interior mining camps are inaccessible by mean of ordinary travel in the summer. In the winter, they are reached by
                            comparatively slow-moving dog teams. But the plane has cut the distance in half and brought every section of America's great Northland closer together.</ab>
