                              <ab>AMENHOTEP IV Founder of Egypt's Mystery Schools</ab>
                              <ab>WHENCE came the knowledge that built the Pyramids and the mighty Temples of the Pharaohs? Civiliza- tion began in
                                    the Nile Valley centuries ago. Where did its first builders acquire their astounding wisdom that started man on
                                    his upward climb? Beginning with naught they overcame nature's forces and gave the world its first sciences and
                                    arts. Did their knowledge come from a race now submerged beneath the sea, or were they touched with Infinite
                                    inspiration? From what concealed source came the wisdom that produced such characters as Amenhotep IV, Leonardo da
                                    Vinci, Isaac Newton, and a host of others?</ab>
                              <ab>Today it is known that they discovered and learned to inter- pret certain Secret Methods for the development of
                                    their inner power of mind. They learned to command the inner forces within their own beings, and to master life.
                                    This secret art of living has been preserved and handed down throughout the ages. Today it is extended to those
                                    who dare to use its pro- found principles to meet and solve the problems of life in these complex times.</ab>

                              <ab>Has life brought you that personal satisfaction, the sense of achieve- ment and happiness that you desire? If not,
                                    it is your duty to your- self to learn about this rational method of applying natural laws for the mastery of
                                    life. To the thoughtful person it is obvious that every- one cannot be entrusted with an intimate knowledge of the
                                    mysteries of life, for everyone is not capable of properly using it. But if you are one of those possessed of a
                                    true desire to forge ahead and wish to make use of the subtle influences of life, the Rosicrucians (not a
                                    religious or- ganization) will send you A Sealed Book of explanation without obli- gation. This Sealed Book tells
                                    how you, in the privacy of your own home, without interference with your personal affairs or manner of liv- ing,
                                    may receive these secret teachings. Not weird or strange practices, but a rational application of the basic laws

                              <ab>FROM the black woods beside the trail rose a shriek of blood-curdling laughter. Slavering, mouthing sounds followed
                                    it, so strange and garbled that at first I did not recognize them as human words. Their unhuman intonations sent a
                                    chill down my spine. </ab>
                              <ab>"Dead men!" the inhuman voice chanted. "Dead men with torn throats! There will be dead men among the pines before
                                    dawn! Dead men! Fools, you are all dead!" </ab>
                              <ab>Ashley and I both fired in the direction of the voice, and in the crashing rever- berations of our shots the ghastly
                                    chant was drowned. But the weird laugh rang out again, deeper in the woods, and then silence closed down like a
                                    black fog, in which I heard the semi-hysterical gasping of the girl. She had released Ashley and was clinging
                                    frantically to me. I could feel the quivering of her lithe body against mine. Probably she had merely followed her
                                    feminine instinct to seek refuge with the strongest; the light of the match had shown her that I was a bigger man
                                    than Ashley. </ab>
                              <ab>"Hurry, for God's sake!" Ashley's voice sounded strangled. "It can't be far to the cabin. Hurry! You'll come with
                                    us, Mr. Garfield?" </ab>
                              <ab>"What was it?" the girl was panting. "Oh, what was it?" </ab>
                              <ab>"A madman, I think," I answered, tucking her trembling little hand under my left arm. But at the back of my head was
                                    whispering the grisly realization that no madman ever had a voice like that. It sounded—God!—it sounded like some
                                    bestial creature speaking with human words, but not with a human tongue! . . . </ab>
