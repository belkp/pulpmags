                    <ab>Out of the somber night the poets come,<lb/>A moment brief to fan their lambent flame;<lb/>Then, like the dimming whisper of a

                    <ab>The gray fog, swirling cloak of cynic Time,<lb/>Meshes achievement in the ages' glomb,<lb/>A moment's mirth, a breath of
                        lilting rime,<lb/>And then--the gray of old oblivion's womb.</ab>
                    <ab>Weaver of melodies all golden-spun<lb/>The singer sings his song--and passes on.<lb/>The poet strums his lyre--then is
                        one<lb/>With gray-hued dusk and rose of fading dawn.</ab>
                    <ab>A moment's laughter on the winds of Time,<lb/>A moment's ripple on Time's silent sea,<lb/>A golden riffle in the river's
                        slime,<lb/>And then--the silence of Eternity.</ab>
                    <ab>Gray dust and ash where leaped the mystic fire,<lb/>Mingled with air and wind the once-red flame;<lb/> Breeze-borne the tune,
                        but now forgot the lyre--<lb/>Remains?--the musty thing that men call Fame.</ab>
                    <ab>Half-curious eyes that scan the yellowed page,<lb/>All heedless of the makers of the feast--<lb/>Why, Pierrot might have been a
                        musty sage,<lb/>François Villon a stoled and sour priest.</ab>
                    <ab>Who penned this lyric? Who this sonnet? Whence<lb/>The soul on fire that snared these stars in song?<lb/>Who knows? Who cares?
                        A vast indifference<lb/>Is all the answer of the marching throng.</ab>

                        to meet all demands. This magazine was established early in 1923 and there has been a steady drain on the supply of back
                        copies ever since. At present, we have the following back numbers on hand for sale:</ab>

                        <ab>THAT young writing marvel, Robert Bloch, has never written a stranger or more thrilling story than this. It is a story of
                            Egypt, a gripping tale of flaming weird jewels in the eye-sockets of a withered mummy, an eery narrative that will hold
                            your breathless interest to the end.</ab>
                        <ab>THIS story rises to a climax so un- usual, so weird and fascinating as to make it unique in literature. This unforgettable
                            tale will be published complete</ab>

                    <ab>COMING NEXT MONTH</ab>
                    <ab>AT THE core of the strange garden, where a circular space was still vacant amid the crowding growths, Adompha came to a mound
                        of loamy, fresh-dug earth. Beside it, wholly nude, and pale and supine as if in death, there lay the odalisque Thulo- neah.
                        Near her, various knives and other implements, together with vials of liquid balsams and viscid gums that Dwerulas used in his
                        grafting, had been emptied upon the ground from a leathern bag. A plant known as the dedaim, with a bulbous, pulpy,
                        whitish-green bole from whose center rose and radiated several leafless reptilian boughs, dripped upon Thulo- neah's bosom an
                        occasional drop of yellowish-red ichor from incisions made in its smooth bark.</ab>
                    <ab>Behind the loamy mound, Dwerulas rose to view with the suddenness of a demon emerging from his subterrene lair. In his hands
                        he held the spade with which he had just finished digging a deep and grave-like hole. Beside the regal stature and girth of
                        Adompha, he seemed no more than a wizened dwarf. His aspect bore all the marks of immense age, as if dusty centuries had sered
                        his flesh and sucked the blood from his veins. His eyes glowed in the bottom of pit-like orbits; his features were black and
                        sunken as those of a long-dead corpse; his body was gnarled as some millennial desert cedar. He stooped incessantly, so that
                        his lank, knotty arms hung almost to the ground. Adompha marveled at the strength of those arms; marveled that Dwerulas could
                        have wielded the heavy shovel so expeditious- ly, could have carried to the garden on his back the burden of those victims
                        whose members he had utilized in his experiments. The king had never demeaned himself to assist at such labors; but, after
                        indicating from time to time the people whose disappearance would in no wise displease him, had done nothing more than watch
                        and supervise the baroque gardening.</ab>
                    <ab>"Is she dead?" Adompha questioned, eyeing the luxurious limbs and body of Thuloneah without emotion.</ab>
                    <ab>"Nay," said Dwerulas. in a voice harsh as a rusty coffin-hinge, "but I have administered to her the drowsy and overpowering
                        juice of the dedaim. Her heart beats impalpably, her blood flows with the sluggishness of that mingled ichor. She will not
                        reawaken . . . save as a part of the garden's life, sharing its obscure sentience. I wait now your further in- structions.
                        What portion . . . or portions?"</ab>
                    <ab>"Her hands were very deft," said Adompha, as if musing aloud, in reply to the half- uttered question. "They knew the subtle
                        ways of love and were learned in all amorous arts. I would have you preserve her hands . . . but nothing else." . . .</ab>
                    <ab>A strange story indeed is this, written in the magic words of one of the greatest living masters of weird fiction. What
                        happened to Thuloneah when her arms were grafted to the dedaim tree makes a fascinating and unusual weird story of immense
                        interest and power. It will be printed complete in the April issue of Weird Tales:</ab>
