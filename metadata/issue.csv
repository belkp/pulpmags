(961) Hallock and Brace were five miles out of Pinecreek and had followed the main-traveled trail due north, not certain they were on the right track, although the Reverend Saunders had seen Chalk and Sue depart in that direction, until they encountered the body of Gallatin's horse. (868) Puzzlement found place beside Chalk's cold fear when Hallock's Colts began their incessant pounding which emptied both cylinders what was the man shooting at? He had never been known to waste lead and then the question was answered by the sidewise lunge of the furiously driven Concord. (783) Hallock had left the rein-dangling Happy Hoofs at one side of the road and gone down the embankment, carrying the mangled clay of Chalk Gallatin. (782) On the floor a man moved; accustomed to watching the hands of men, their hands and their eyes, Hallock almost mechanically saw the hand of the man lift and mechanically he shot, wondering as he pressed trigger, if there was an unused cartridge in the gun he pointed. (779) But Hallock had erred somewhat in judging the reason for Coldiron's willingness to talk; in fact, neither the gun-fighter nor Brace had given Chalk Gallatin due credit for the craftiness which existed behind his white mask of a face. (760) Two hours later he brought the surprising information that Chalk Gallatin had accepted the challenge, would, accompanied by Blackfoot Dixon to act second, meet Hallock and Brace in an hour behind the Sundown Stage Company's corrals. (758) The next instant the white face of Gallatin flashed upon Hallock's vision; the puncher was on his knees, eyes fastened upon the point in the brush where he thought Hallock would break through. (737) Well, to make it short an' snappy, that lousy pup, Chalk Gallatin's run off with her! Yep,"" as Sam leaped a foot off the floor and Hallock called on his Maker to damn the soul of Chalk, ""she was buyin' stuff in my place half hour or more ago. (709) ""Yuh, Blackfoot! Yuh aimin' to cheat yuhr pal, Chalk, o' the glory o' salivatin' me? Why don'tcha draw, Injun?"" Hallock's tone should have precipitated action on the quarterbreeds part, but it didn't. (704) Determined to learn the worst at once and, incidentally, any other information the preacher possessed which would aid pursuit, Hallock flung Happy Hoofs reins over her head and approached the door of the parsonage. (696) The expression of his eyes was abysmal; it looked for a moment as if, in spite of the twin barrels, Chalk would draw and extinguish that remaining spark in Hallock. (695) Armed with a dug against the vengeance-thirsting Hallock as well to stab him with a blade of grass! But Chalk's eager, curving fingers never closed on that tantalizing Colt-handle a powerful tug at the back of his shirt collar lifted him from his knees; then he was hurled flat on his back and Hallock dropped astride him, driving the breath from his body and seemingly crushing his ribs. (687) ""Leave it lay, pardner,"" drawled a man's voice near at hand and Hallock looked for the first time into the box, lighted by an oil lamp. (682) The telltale shadow on the shade had warned Gallatin, when informed of it by the author of the close shot, Blackfoot Dixon, that Hallock was getting dangerously well, would soon be his old self and now or never was the time to act. (678) Hallock had withdrawn his feet from the stirups and was drawing up his right leg to clear the pommel when the iron-shod hoofs slipped on the none-too-clean floor   though there were a half dozen brass cuspidors in different parts of the barroom and the paint mare crashed down on her left side, pegging one leg of her rider to the floor and his back against the bar.

Valiant? They are all valiant as cocks, on their own ground! Ever, when I hear of a new mighty peck-and-spur, I marvel what would happen of the last, could they both meet on the same dunghill! I knew one, especially, of late and, body o' me! were I a youth again with limbs and eyes and blood fit for prowess; were I one of those that are ever readier with proof by stoccado than with word argument, with slap of cloak at the face than with sweep of plumed hat "" He struck Beckett on the shoulder with the mutilated hand, in friendly mockery, to emphasize his words and, at the same time, not to leave the eager boy on the right out of his amenity, gave Wyatt a sly thrust of his wooden leg under the table. (1753) ""Ak, senor,"" he cried at sight of the American, ""buenos dias, buenos diasl I regret not having been at home when you came; my house is yours, pray believe me,"" and he advanced to bow courteously, smiling with his lips but not with his eyes; nor did he offer his hand, for which Haskell thought the better of him. (1478) For the first time in his life there came into this strong man's consciousness a vague, troubling, half-realized sensation of fear he was alone with a person whose like he had never encountered; he knew the terrible strength of that hand which rested lightly on his arm, but there was a subtle impression of moral power, of dominant wili-force, in the other's mere silent presence that cowed Blondie and forced him to stumble along sullenly and without a definite thought of flight or resistance. (1386) At the same moment his eyes roved to the open safe and, catching sight for the first time of the bolts protruding from the edge of the heavy steel door, he realized that last night in the dusk he could not have fully closed it before throwing off the combination. (1303) On seeing him emerge at last from the zone of destruction, I was horror-stricken, for apparently every hair had been burned from his head and face, while shreds of skin hung from his hands and cheeks and brow; the dark portions of his eyes even were white under the influence of the dreadful shock he had undergone. (1292) Twice she clapped her little palms together, and the servant who had admitted him reappeared, took the horses and guide in charge after laying off Haskell's bags, and a sullen old Maya woman, who had been lurking under the arches, led him away to a chamber that opened on the gallery directly at the spot where the unknown knife-wielder must have stood at the time of the delivery of the second blow. (1266) Cries heralded the arrival of the party, and there was a rush from all sides; a wall of gleaming bronze bodies, serried rows of curious dark eyes, formed on either hand in a twinkling and Haskell found himself noting the difference between this reception and that which would have been accorded in the village of American blanket Indians. (1157) ""No, far from it, Don Felipe; but I have lost too much time and I must push on to join young Peters, my assistant."" Haskell's eyes dwelt coldly on the other's face. (1155) As he did so, the door closed again and he found himself face to face and alone with the brother who had been lowered before his very eyes into the Cathedral vault the brother Queen Horatia sought to destroy that Gisdel might reign. (1154) For a single moment, that yet seemed, in its tension, to pass the bounds of time, as Wyatt found himself under the glare  felt rather than seen of those sinister eyes that from the first had struck a chill to his soul, the full realization of his madness swept upon him. (1103) The last driver of the last tram had hinted that it was wise to travel by day only, but now after nightfall of the second day the white man and his Indian guide had ridden up to the gates of the Calderon y Ortegas hacienda, been admitted by a servant who had vanished without a word, and now Haskell was walking up and down the patio in the moonlight, waiting waiting to see if some unknown assassin with the henequen knife would get him before the problematic host arrived, or vice versa. (1072) This meant a little truck about the size of a hand-car, with a canopy over it, drawn by two galloping mules driven by a squat, brawny Maya in cotton shirt and pants, whose stubby, bare great toes turned in; whose skin was the color of an old penny; whose close-cropped wiry hair was crowned with a straw sombrero wound with green and yellow; in whose teeth was clenched a long cruel, plaited whip; at whose side hung one of the long, massive-bladed, bent-tipped henequen knives a formidable figure who was strangely shy and gentle save to the mules and for them he found more curses, threats and poetical phrasings of damnation and opprobrium than Haskell had ever heard before. (1056) The Berkintowitz who had been so silent and retiring till that moment came to life with a great joy on his freckled face. (1038) Haskell knew he was looking for the first time on one of tens of thousands of ruined buildings which dot the country from the Gulf of Mexico to the lakes of Nicaragua, bespeaking the life and death of a wonderful people, older than the Aztecs, even older than the Toltecs, perhaps even more ancient than the Colhuans, and some say that these stone cities, often miles in extent, were teeming with the life of a highly civilized people long before the days of Babylon or the birth of the first Pharaoh. (1007) Drawing from his pocket a little round mirror from a transit, he held it in the palm of his left hand in such a way that it could not be seen from above, and though he appeared to be looking down and paying no attention to what went on over his head, he could see well enough to be in no danger so long as the unknown pursued the tactics of creeping around the galleries and striking when the marked man came within reach below. (1006) A trooper, probably for the first time in the history of the world, was at hand, and he promptly struck Stephen Been with the blunt edge of his sword, and towed him to the large hut, with many intermissions in the slabs thereof, which served as a jail.

Was not Gallia, when its pathway led it into such close proximity to this enormous planet, running a risk of being attracted within its influence? Might not that influence be altogether disastrous? The professor, it is true, in his estimate of the duration of his comet's revolution, had represented that he had made all proper allowances for any perturbations that would be caused either by Jupiter, by Saturn, or by Mars; but what if there were any errors in his calculations? what if there should be any elements of disturbance on which he had not reckoned? Speculations of this kind became more and more frequent, and Lieutenant Procope pointed out that the danger incurred might be of a fourfold character: first, that the comet, being irresistibly attracted, might be drawn on to the very surface of the planet, and there annihilated; secondly, that as the result of being brought under that attraction, it might be transformed into a satellite, or even a sub-satellite, of that mighty world; thirdly, that it might be diverted into a new orbit, which would never be coincident with the ecliptic; or lastly, its course might be so retarded that it would only reach the ecliptic too late to permit any junction with the earth. (1567) ""Although the orbit of the earth was unaltered,"" continued the professor, ""the result of the collision was the projection of the comet into a new orbit altogether."" ""And may I ask,"" said Procope, deferentially, ""whether you have got the elements of the fresh orbit?"" ""Yes."" ""Then perhaps you know "" ""I know this, sir, that at 47 minutes, 35.6 seconds after two oclock on the morning of the 1st of January last, Gallia, in passing its ascending node, came in contact with the earth; that on the 10th of January it crossed the orbit of Venus; that it reached its perihelion on the 15th; that it recrossed the orbit of Venus; that on the 1st of February it passed its descending node; on the 13th crossed the orbit of Mars; entered the zone of the telescopic planets on the 10th of March, and, attracting Neriria, carried it off as a satellite."" Servadac interposed: ""We are already acquainted with well nigh all these extraordinary facts; many of them, moreover, we learned from documents which we picked up, and which, although unsigned, we cannot entertain a doubt have originated with you."" Professor Rosette drew himself up proudly and said: ""Of course they originated with me. (1542) ""I thought major, that it was not unlikely you were in ignorance of the fact that both Ceuta and Gibraltar have been traversing the solar regions on the surface of a comet."" The major smiled incredulously; but Servadac, nothing daunted, went on to detail the results of the collision between the comet and the earth, adding that, as there was the almost immediate prospect of another concussion, it had occurred to him that it might be advisable for the whole population of Gallia to unite in taking precautionary measures for the common welfare. (1244) ""And if,"" said the lieutenant, after a moment's pause, and the slightest possible frown at the interruption ""and if the collision should occur at our antipodes, the sudden check to the velocity of the comet would be quite equivalent to a shock in situ; and, another thing, we should run the risk of being suffocated, for all our comet's atmosphere would be assimilated with the terrestrial atmosphere, and we, supposing we were not dashed to atoms, should be left as it were upon the summit of an enormous mountain (for such to all intents and purposes Gallia would be), 450 miles above the level of the surface of the globe, without a particle of air to breathe."" ""But would not our chances of escape be considerably better,"" asked Count Timascheff, ""in the event of either of the comet's poles being the point of contact?"" ""Taking the combined velocity into account,"" answered the lieutenant, ""I confess that I fear the violence of the shock will be too great to permit our destruction to be averted."" A general silence ensued, which was broken by the lieutenant himself. (1221) The hypothesis, to which they had now accustomed themselves for so long, that a new asteroid had been formed by a fracture of the earth's surface, seemed to fall to the ground when they found that Professor Palmyrin Rosette had associated the name of Gallia, not with their present home, but with what he called ""my comet""; and that theory being abandoned, they were driven to make the most improbable speculations to replace it. (1197) Somehow or other the conversation would eventually work its way round to the topic of a future collision between the comet and the earth; and in the same degree as this was a matter of sanguine anticipation to Captain Servadac and his friends, it was a matter of aversion to the astronomical enthusiast, who had no desire to quit his present quarters in a sphere which, being of his own discovery, he could hardly have cared for more if it had been of his own creation. (1196) Had he ascertained the true character of her orbit? had he established any data from which it would be possible to reckon what time must elapse before she would again approach the earth? The only intelligible words which the astronomer had uttered had been, ""My comet!"" To what could the exclamation refer? Was it to be conjectured that a fragment of the earth had been chipped off by the collision of a comet? and if so, was it implied that the name of the comet itself was Gallia, and were they mistaken in sup- posing that such was the name given by the savant to the little world that had been so suddenly launched into space? Again and again they discussed these questions; but no satisfactory answer could be found. (1171) They could not explain it, but here they were once more upon terrestrial soil; in a swoon they had left the earth, and in a similar swoon they had come back! Of the balloon not a vestige remained, and contrary to previous computation, the comet had merely grazed the earth, and was traversing the regions of space, again far away! CHAPTER XIX BACK AGAIN ""IN Algeria, captain?"" ""Yes, Ben Zoof, in Algeria; and not far from Mostaganem."" Such were the first words which, after their return to consciousness, were exchanged between Servadac and his orderly. (1165) ""There is no accounting for the freaks of philosophers, you know,"" said Servadac; ""and have I not told you that this philosopher in particular is one of the most eccentric beings in creation?"" ""Besides,"" added the lieutenant, ""it is exceedingly likely that his observation had been going on for some considerable period before the convulsion happened."" Thus the general conclusion arrived at by the Callian Academy of Science was this: That on the night of the 31st of December, a comet, crossing the ecliptic, had come into collision with the earth, and that the violence of the shock had separated a huge fragment from the globe, which fragment from that date had been traversing the remote inter-planetary regions. (1158) ""If it be correct, I suppose we must conclude that the enormous disc we observed on the night of the catastrophe was the comet itself; and the velocity with which it was traveling must have been so great that it was hardly arrested at all by the attraction of the earth."" ""Plausible enough,"" answered Count Timascheff; ""and it is to this comet that our scientific friend here has given the name Gallia."" It still remained a puzzle to them all why the astronomer should apparently be interested in the comet so much more than in the new little world in which their strange lot was cast. (1157)"

(1382) Perhaps it was not altogether surprising that he had almost forgotten him; he had never seen him since the days of his youth, that time of life which, with a certain show of justice, has been termed the age of ingratitude; for, in point of fact, the astronomer was none other than Professor Palmyrin Rosette, Servadac's old science- master at the Lycée Charlemagne. (1369) The hypothesis, to which they had now accustomed themselves for so long, that a new asteroid had been formed by a fracture of the earth's surface, seemed to fall to the ground when they found that Professor Palmyrin Rosette had associated the name of Gallia, not with their present home, but with what he called ""my comet""; and that theory being abandoned, they were driven to make the most improbable speculations to replace it. (1347) Speculations of this kind became more and more frequent, and Lieutenant Procope pointed out that the danger incurred might be of a fourfold character: first, that the comet, being irresistibly attracted, might be drawn on to the very surface of the planet, and there annihilated; secondly, that as the result of being brought under that attraction, it might be transformed into a satellite, or even a sub-satellite, of that mighty world; thirdly, that it might be diverted into a new orbit, which would never be coincident with the ecliptic; or lastly, its course might be so retarded that it would only reach the ecliptic too late to permit any junction with the earth. (1139) The diameter of Jupiter is 85, 390 miles, nearly eleven times as great as that of the earth; its volume is 1,387 times, and its mass 300 times greater; and although the mean density is only about a third of that of water (whence it has been supposed that the superficies of Jupiter is liquid), yet its other proportions were large enough to warrant the apprehension that important disturbances might result from its proximity. (1121) Not that any doubt was entertained as to their having been able successfully to cope with the rigors of the winter; but Captain Servadac, in a way that did honor to his generosity, represented that, however uncourteous might have been their former behavior, it was at least due to them that they should be informed of the true condition of things, which they had no opportunity of learning; and, moreover, that they should be invited to cooperate with the population of Nina's Hive, in the event of any measures being suggested by which the shock of the approaching collision could be mitigated. (1107) When Ben Zoof and Negrete had extricated their patient from the envelope of furs in which he had been wrapped by Servadac and the lieutenant, they found themselves face to face with a shriveled little man, about five feet two inches high, with a round bald head smooth and shiny as an ostrich's egg, no beard unless the unshorn growth of a week could be so described and a long hooked nose that supported a pair of spectacles such as to many near-sighted people seems to have become a part of their individuality. (1058) They figure on the basis of Einstein's theory of the curvature of time if one goes on far enough, he will eventually return to where he started from or in other words ""the world having lived and died will live again and die again."" It takes millions of years to complete a cycle, but because of the many times increased speed with which our hero travels, because of his enormous size, they are able to figure his return to a time very nearly corresponding the year in which he left the Earth. (990) Scarcely 31,000,000 miles had separated Gallia from Jupiter, the minimum distance of Saturn would not be less than 415,000,000 miles; but even this distance, although too great to affect the comet's progress more than had been duly reckoned on, was considerably shorter than what had ever separated Saturn from the earth. (989) ""Considerably,"" answered the lieutenant, who went on to describe how the displacement of a point at the equator of Jupiter was twenty-seven times as rapid as on the earth, causing the polar compression to be about 2,378 miles; how the axis, being nearly perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, caused the days and nights to be nearly of the same length, and the seasons to be invariable; and how the amount of light and heat received by the planet is only a twenty-fifth part of that received by the earth, the average distance from the sun being 475,693,000 miles. (977) Ben Zoof was, as a matter of course, allowed to be present, and Professor Rosette had been asked to attend; but he declined on the plea of taking no interest in the matter. (973) Though light and heat were now reduced to a twenty-fifth part of their terrestrial intensity, so that a perpetual twilight seemed to have settled over Gallia, yet the population felt cheered even by the little that was left, and buoyed up by the hope that they should ultimately regain their proper position with regard to the great luminary, of which the temperature has been estimated as not less than 5,000,000 degrees. (948) Although it is not to be questioned that a genuine desire of doing an act of kindness to his fellow-creatures was a leading motive of Servadac's proposed visit to Gibraltar, it must be owned that another idea, confided to nobody, least of all to Count Timascheff, had been conceived in the brain of the worthy Gascon. (935) She had persuaded her uncle to make the calculations for me in his moments of relaxation (what an awful thought that conjured in my mind of the intellectual labour of these men!) Apparently the man, by figuring the length of time I had been away and the position of my sun in space, could identify it among the amazing records he possessed of all the stars in our universe, past, present, or future things inconceivable to me. (933) At first Captain Servadac thought of going in person with the invitation; but, remembering Rosette's dislike to visitors, he altered his mind, and sent young Pablo up to the observatory with a formal note, requesting the pleasure of Professor Rosette's company at the New Year's fête. (918) Had the comet been in any way projected from its course, so as to be likely to fail in coming into contact with the earth, the professor would have been quite unable to conceal his satisfaction.

(755) Arthur and Estelle stood at the window and looked out as the sun rushed more and more rapidly across the sky until it became but a streak of light, shifting first to the right and then to the left as the seasons passed in their turn. (727) Few of them thought so far, but there was actually if Arthur's estimate of several thousand years' drop back through time was correct there was actually no other group of English-speaking people in the world. (713) My attention had been for some time drawn away from this philanthropic work by certain symptoms of uneasiness I noticed in my daughter Anne, and my wife and I decided after careful consideration that Anne must be in love, and that her love must be unhappy. (703) WE have all heard of and read about the Einstein theory, which involves the use in its calculations of the mysterious ""fourth dimension"" Here our author gives a wonderfully effective picture of what the fourth dimension did in the annihilation of time in the wiping out of the centuries, where it brings a company of twentieth century business men and xvomen to a time centuries back from the days of modern Nezu York they are transferred with great rapidity of receding time to the days when Indians were the only inhabitants of Manhattan, until at last the recession of the centuries ceases and gives them pause for a while. (702) Then all went out and darkness once more fell upon the deep! I had just time to see my uncle once more cast apparently senseless on the flooring of the raft, Hans at the helm, ""spitting fire"" under the influence of the electricity which seemed to have gone through him. (700) Talking to Estelle Woodward was at no time an onerous duty, but it must be admitted that Arthur Chamberlain found it difficult to keep his conversation strictly upon his business. (698) Reasoning from possible causes we are aware that the hobby of Professor Townsend was the endeavor to create a living thing from inorganic matter, and putting the two together it seems to me that the logical hypothesis would be that he either succeeded in creating a monster of a sort unknown to biologists, or discovered and developed unheard of powers and habits in a creature already known."" ""If there's such a thing in this house, believe me I'm going to find it,"" said the chief, stamping out of the room. (668) It was an engineering feat, and in the engineering periodicals, whose study was a part of Arthur's business, great space had been given to the building and the methods of its construction. (646) Doctor Hackensaw looked up with a smile: ""I'm spending five minutes spare time in writing a few thousand autographs for that class of people of whom one is born every minute, if not oftener."" ""But what's that queer machine you're using?"" ""This, Pep, is one of my minor inventions a little device designed to save the time of authors, movie-stars, and other celebrities. (645) I could not help gazing at these riches buried in the entrails of mother earth, of which no man would have the enjoyment to the end of time! These treasures mighty and inexhaustible, were buried in the morning of the earth's history, at such awful depths, that no crowbar or pickax will ever drag them from their tomb! The light of our Ruhmkorf's coil, increased tenfold by the myriad of prismatic masses of rock, sent their jets of fire in every direction, and I could fancy myself traveling through a huge hollow diamond, the rays of which produced myriads of extraordinary effects. (644) On the one hand they knew that all of New York could not be actually destroyed and replaced by a splendid forest in the space of a few hours, so the'accident or catastrophe must have occurred to those in the tower, and, on the other hand, they had seen all of New York vanish by bits and fragments, to be replaced by a smaller and dingier town, had beheld that replaced in turn, and at last had landed in the midst of this forest. (637) Arthur shook his head and led her back toward the Skyscraper, which was now thronged with the people from all the floors who had come down to the ground and were standing excitedly about the concourse asking each other what had happened. (632) Some of the people were, like Van Deventer and Arthur, so situated that they could view the episode as an adventure, or, like Estelle, who had no immediate fear because all her family was provided for without her help and lived far from New York, so they would not learn of the catastrophe for some time. (631) In my state of mind, the idea came into my head that one day perhaps, when my fossil bones were found, their discovery so far below the level of the earth might give rise to solemn and interesting scientific discussions. (630) How many thousands of years is it since I last knew the true companionship? For a long time I have been lonely, but there were people, creatures of flesh and blood. (622)"

(1210) If only five hundred years ago (or little more than ten generations), which is not a long time as human progress goes, anyone had come along with a story wherein radio telephone, steamships, airplanes, electricity, painless surgery, the phonograph, and a few other modern marvels were described, he would probably have been promptly flung into a dungeon. (772) The first thing he noticed, for in the circumstances he began at the end, was that the last signalling which took place was on October 10th, that is the day before he had been ordered to change his course. (757) It is a progressive, thrifty little French town of chief importance principally for the reason that here for four years during the great war the French army has been nearer to the German frontier than at any other point, with the exception of that small portion of Alsace actually in the hands of the French. (736) I watched him, breathless with anxiety, and, as he got higher, my imagination pictured the little gold grapple, invisible above the brow of the precipice, with perhaps a single thin prong wedged into a crevice, and slowly ploughing its way towards the edge with each impulse of the climber, until but another pull was needed to set it flying! So vivid was my fancy that I tried to banish it by noticing that a certain knot in the rope remained just at the level of my eyes, where it had been from the start. (726) As he came to Macrae's description of the death of his companions and the effect on himself, Captain Evered became confirmed in the view he had always held, that Macrae had never been a man suited to this kind of duty. (717) I COME now to a part of my narrative which would have been deemed altogether incredible in those closing years of the nineteenth century that witnessed the first steps towards the solution of the deepest mysteries of the ether, although men even then held in their hands, without knowing it, powers which, after they had been mastered and before use had made them familiar, seemed no less than godlike. (695) Instinctively we made our way towards the Central Sea, and I cannot now tell what wild thoughts passed through my mind, nor of what follies I might have been guilty, but for a very serious preoccupation which brought me back to practical life. (690) I said nothing about my suspicions, but upon inquiry I found out that an extra and pressing order for metal had arrived from the Austrian government the very day of the pretended fire, and I drew the inference that Syx, in his haste to fill the order his supply having been drawn low had started to work, contrary to his custom, at night, and had immediately found reason to repent his rashness. (686) ""You no doubt have been told how one night the Syx engine was heard working for a few minutes, the first and only night work it was ever known to have done, and how, hardly had it started up when a fire broke out in the mill, and the engine was instantly stopped. (681) Some of the great white rays that had been one of the telescopic wonders of the lunar landscapes disappeared, and the face of the moon, which had remained unchanged before the eyes of the children of Adam from the beginning of their race, now looked as if the blast of a furnace had swept it. (665) After reading the part that has already been repeated here, he came to the point where Macrae, in the signal-room, finished his daily entry or letter with the avowed intention of going to the instrument and putting on the receiver or headpiece; to quote his own words, ""as though called upon"" to do so. (656) On taking charge of his patient, he at once saw that the poor fellow was not so much ""dazed"" as excited, and it was some time before he could be soothed not, iri fact, until it had been explained to him how he came to be on board the Sagitta. (635) The details immediately following he will find particularly hard to accept, because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or she, the reader in question, must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more than a year ago. (630) Stevenson and Langford finally reached the top of the Grand Teton   the only successfu' members of a party of nine practised climbers who had started together from the bottom they found there a little rectangular enclosure, made by piling up rocks, six or seven feet across and three feet in height, bearing evidences of great age, and indicating that the red Indians had, for some unknown purpose, resorted to the summit of this tremendous peak long before the white men invaded their mountains.

(891) She had been a pretty and joyous creature but in those dreadful months the pink in her cheeks fled before a dead sallowness, the eyes that had once laughed and sparkled with the joy of living lay drearily deep behind dark circles, the lustre departed from her hair, a hopeless stoop came into her shoulders and the shuffle of despond into her feet. (676) At that moment Lannen fancied he saw a face at the open window, but before he could ascertain whether it was his imagination or not, it had vanished; but to him it seemed he had seen a young pale face with smouldering dark eyes and close cropped hair. (609) They made a circuit of the room and came to pause on the figure of young Carrington, who had stirred for the first time and was now sitting up, his elbows on his knees, his face buried in his hands. (601) It is permissible exaggeration to say that Snedeker’s eyes threatened to pop out of his head as, fascinated, they saw one of the floor plates, one of the three-inch chrome steel supposedly impregnable floor plates, part company with its fellows and drop out of sight, to be replaced a moment later by the head and broad shoulders of a man who turned a very dirty but grinning face up to look into the banker’s own, remarking: “Hello, Jim. (565) At the bedroom door she laid a feverish hand on mine, and I felt a shudder go through her, but when we stood staring at the cold, dark figure before us, her face was unexpressive, emotionless. (531) For four dreary months he had seen only the faces of brown and yellow women, had heard only their tongues; and the longing for the sight of a white woman, for the sound of a white woman’s voice, had become a terrible thirst that threatened to wither his soul; so now  after that journey through the white hell, from Urga across the North Gobi and the Tchuchun-Shan Range into Tibet the glimpse of that pallid face in the doorway of the Russian Consulate in this desert village inspired in him a profound reverence for its owner. (520) I told Snedeker what I wanted and he gave me the run of the whole place  but with that idiot Daniels tagging at my heels and blatting every second about the ‘effrontery of the miscreants’ in picking on the Totem National for their ‘dastardly outrage.’ To hear him you’d think that the Totem was the only bank that ever had been cracked, that it was nothing short of sacrilege and high treason for rude hands to touch even a deposit slip belonging to it. (513) A swift scuffle, a snarl and a thud as from the impact of a billy on a skull came to the ears of the listener below, then a bleating protest from Molspini: “Don’t, sergeant, don’t I’ll be quiet.” Cass heard the snap of handcuffs and a heavy sound as though a sack of potatoes had been tossed to the floor. (503) Snedeker, president and autocrat of his little realm, who daily was accustomed to making his power and personality felt by all with whom he came in contact in the bank or out, had been told in almost the same tone and terms he would have used to a mere bookkeeper that one more chance would be given for him to make good. (483) I’ve been through the Valley of the Living Dead and came out alive! I’ve seen them living dead men by the millions and millions, fighting, stabbing, shooting tearing at each other’s throats like maddened beasts! And beasts they are, maddened by blood! Blood flows in rivers in the valley where the dead men live. (469) At her evocation the eyes of Lance Amber lost the glassy expression, became almost normal, and he lifted one thin white hand, passing it over his brow as if to wipe away the remaining tangles of a nightmare. (439) Following the evening meal of tsamba, talkan-cakes and tea he had retreated to his bedchamber, one of the three private rooms off the main hall of the caravanserai, the pallid face of the first white woman that he had seen in four months burning in his brain. (438) For a long time it seemed to my over-wrought nerves the woman sat there with her hands clasped loosely in her lap, her great eyes staring at a red glowing spot on the old stove. (437) That being the case, the entrance .to The Valley Where Dead Men Live, on this side of the range, must be near at hand.” “You’ll say I’m crazy when I tell you that I have seen living dead men! Dead men who do not know that they are dead. (436)"

(790) Johnson, here, who swears that the woman whose body you saw in the morgue, and have identified as your wife, was alive and well at ten o'clock this morning? Yes, he even goes farther and asserts that he talked to her and that she, aided by two others, robbed Harden & Company of a valuable diamond brooch."" Winters leaped to his feet, his eyes blazing, his face aflame with rage. (673) Ten minutes later a figure dressed in Hankinson's clothes, much muffled about the neck and face, and having Hankinson's cap pulled down over its nose, slipped out of that quiet house and went away by devious paths to other and safer parts. (548) Hankinson formed the opinion on good grounds that this young woman retired to bed long before closing hours on Friday nights; at any rate, there was a window in the very upper room in which a light shone for a while every night at half-past nine. (545) Leon has been arrested has confessed! Last night at twelve o'clock the police found Leblanc's mutilated body in a sewer in the Rue de Loix. (511) Winters from its casket? How could she, a dead woman, be alive? And Johnson, as well as other employees of Harden & Company, swore that she had been? They had seen her talked with her nearly twenty-four hours after her reported death. (511) Once more the sound of invisible footsteps and Grimstead looked up from the dead body in time to see the door of the dressing-room open quickly and close. (510) This man stood up as Carney entered, nodded his head slightly and opened a white-washed door a few feet back from where he had been sitting. (502) After finding the body of Jones in the Guerney study, and failing to locate a scrap of evidence that would incriminate the killer of Guerney or of Jones, Johnny had taken Mildred away from the house of death. (495) If the thumb-screws were put on Black Allen he might tell who had hired him, which would save a lot of time and trouble, Johnny had left him in the house because he believed, as the girl had, that the fellow was a detective. (491) Guerney has that in his hand."" ""How is it you didn't hear the shot?"" ""My room is downstairs, and there were several closed doors between."" The lieutenant grunted, and then looked at Jones. (480) A specialist of renown, he had lectured at the medical school from which Doctor Lake had been graduated and, although he did not know him except as a student would be expected to know a class instructor, it made death more of a personal matter and, for a moment, shattered his professional calm.

The yegg cursed, stared a moment wildly' then his pig eyes snapped evilly as Gunson's other hand, reaching upward behind him, turned up the light. (574) Delaney had given me the approximate angle at which the knife had been driven into the body and this angle corresponded to that which would have obtained had the woman been killed by an arrow shot through the open transom of a room twenty-five feet down the hall. (555) For, following the finding of Backus' body, the board of directors had capitulated despite the protests of Grimes, who suddenly became panic-stricken on Joan's account, as I will explain later, and had hoisted the white flag and, acting under instructions telephoned from what was afterwards discovered to have been a tapped wire near his residence, had left the package of money on a stump close to the tunnel entrance. (538) Too astonished for utterance, Grimes hastened away, laboring under the belief that Joan was, herself, ""The Man in the Black Mask."" She had always been a romantic young woman and the old man feared that she had, at last, given way to her inclination. (494) As he stood there on the deck, swaying with the drunken pitch of the two-masted, square-rigged vessel, it all came back to him came back for the millionth time, with a burning sharpness that made him visualize, as though etched with steel upon his brain, the lamp-lit Australian water-front, the slinking shadows along the quay; made him feel, as if experiencing again, the sickening emotions following the blow and the return to consciousness in the hold of the trading brig bound for eleven degrees south of the equator. (489) Before the vessel reached the white coral walls of Papeite, Black Michael demonstrated that he could keep a threat; The Boy was broken; the slender thread between strength and weakness snapped ... like the string of a fine instrument struck by brutal hands; and when the Libertine cast moorings in the blue lagoon of the Tahitian capital he was still aboard, with a bruised body and a bruised mind, knowing in his tortured heart that some day, when the courage was given him, he would kill the master of the brig. (474) Black Michael's body had been found and the mate had come to accuse him  But how did he find out ? The only incriminating evidence, the knife, had been thrown into the sea. (474) Slipping in quietly by the side door (the room was over a saloon on a quiet street) Gunson, unseen, mounted the narrow stair listened a moment at a door on the second landing turned the knob noiselessly unlocked the door by turning the key from the outside with a long, thin wire made for this purpose  and entered. (462) Hugging the wall, for the more silent footing there afforded, the policeman, one hand before him, feeling along the plaster, the other holding his gun, went upward steadily in the whispering gloom, eyes strained against the blackness, ears attuned to the throbbing silence, like the beating of a heart. (438) You see, young Knibbs, after you left this morning I made a second careful examination of De Brunner's letter from Cassius Wynn and found the envelope not torn open but carefully cut. (436) My brain whirling, I started off in the direction of the house, intending to place my suspicions squarely before Grimes and find out, before going any farther into the case, just what he knew and what he suspected for I was growing of the opinion that he suspected something strongly against, some one when he took sides squarely against his directors, even to the extent of paying all bills himself.

(718) of November thirteenth,"" the first named being the hour when the deceased was known to have been seen alive the last time, and the latter the time when her dead body was discovered. (712) I had been called into the case on a complaint made by Jedidiah Quinot, of Boston, an esteemed gentleman of his community, who shed real tears, nearly wore out his glasses in polishings and blew his nose prodigiously as he told me the story of his suspicions concerning his harum-scarum nephew one Herbert Cryder, whom he feared had not only hopelessly involved himself but disgraced the family in a gold mine speculation. (696) The defendant, Samuel Smith, was violently jealous of his wife, and on numerous occasions had been heard to threaten to kill each one of several men whom he believed or imagined to have paid too great attention to the said Hattie Smith, described as a beautiful woman by all who knew her. (674) Just as we edged in for the last time I saw something a shadow, it might have been, or a discoloration in the cliff, but at any rate it was something and dropped my glasses to seize my paddle to swing in closer, but before I could dip we were nearly capsized on a hidden rock and only the caution of the Indian, whose muscles had already been set for flight, saved us from death as the vision was snatched from my eyes. (642) Moriarity had been arrested, of course, but released almost at once, because policemen as well as eminently respectable citizens had seen him a block away from the building at the same time that Hardy's scream was heard by the night watchman and elevator man of the building. (639) The prosecuting attorney had been gazing fixedly at this portrait of the murdered woman, with an expression on his face that might have been inspired by a feeling of the stern retributive justice he was called upon to enforce, or, possibly only of sorrow that such awful tragedy should snuff out the life of so charming a woman. (620) More than that, two women, who couldn't tell what had happened to them or the missing men they had accompanied to the House on the Cliff, had been found exhausted and more than half crazy in the big woods that the placp on three sides surround. (617) But the trouble was to find the people who were or had been connected with the ""Aerie."" Stanwood was in charge, but it was easily found out that he spent most of his time in Seattle, Portland, Vancouver or Victoria. (615) During the time that guests were on the cliff, we found that it had been the custom for them to bring their own servants a couple of Japanese boys or a maid sufficing for these visits, which were generally of a sort in which the utmost privacy seemed to be desirable.

(657) Accordingly, when Creighton informed her that on the following Saturday night a batch of new money was to be turned out at Wortz's, Rita at once wrote to Nevins, saying that nine o'clock would be a good time for a raid. (617) Nevins tried to track his wandering girl to her lair, in which fell purpose he had no luck at all till he heard, through police channels, that a Miss Rita Daly had been questioned in connection with the disappearance of one J. (605) ""Open the box for the gentleman, Higgins, like a good boy,"" interposed Smith with what might possibly have been a gleam of hope in his eyes. (536) So it came about that Rita Daly, sitting at an open window in the parlor of Geiger's home at 120 Willow Avenue, was startled to see a good-looking young man whom she recognized at once, walk into the gateway of the Franklin house across the street. (505) It was a desperate attempt and might have ended in disaster had not Langa Doonh bounded through the door at that very moment and struck up the pistol so that the bullet went six inches over Smith's head. (499) Why did not her father speak ? Why did he sit there, evidently jingling the money and keys in his pockets, certainly kicking the waste-paper basket, certainly smiling in that queer, provoking way? This puzzled Letty beyond belief ; it evidently puzzled Sir Cheville too, for after a long pause he turned from the window through which he was affecting to look, picked up the eyeglass which dangled from his neck by a thin gold chain, fixed it in his right eye and stared at the man he was reproaching. (490) As he followed his captive through the door he dropped the gun, which he had been carrying, into his side pocket and turned toward the servants' compartment. (479) For, upon the fire-escape, peering into the room, was Pug! The knife was still embedded in the bootlegger's body; it had not been dislodged from the time Joe had forced the stiletto to its mark. (472) Was his course of action best suited to bring out the man he wanted? Would the head of the organization of thieves attempt a personal blow when so many of his agents continued to fail? Did he lack personal courage or was he, perhaps, known to Smith and feared recognition in the event of a failure to kill? These and similar thoughts occupied the mind of the man upon the carriage seat until he was suddenly interrupted in a most unexpected manner. (468) His eyes searching every corner of the compartment and keenly inspecting the figure of the crying woman, Smith moved on from window to window until he reached the door, which he opened, and stepped inside. (459) He leaned his tall figure towards her, resting his hands on the bars of his bicycle, and Letty noticed for the first time that he had curiously green eyes which scintillated in a strange manner.

(713) Perry owned real estate to the value of one hundred and forty thousand dollars on East One Hundred and Fifty-seventh Street and that the property had been purchased at about the same time the doctor opened his dental office. (681) Then, a week later  when Dennison was arrested when she had read that on the kitchen table of his apartment had been found a blueberry pie w'ith a piece cut out of it and the slice missing, she had felt that to her had been given the last link in the chain of evidence. (678) Quizzed about the tragedy, he admits going to the hotel, but says that when he found the door unlocked and entered the room the place was empty, so he figured that the couple had gone to some show, and went outside to wait for them. (676) Where had Detective Carr been before he came to the attorney's office? Before the mystery could be solved that question had to be answered. (658) The cold-blooded fact that just before or after he had killed the woman who had been everything to him for two years he had eaten a piece of pie that she had baked as a surprise for him, turned people against Dennison more than any other one fact of the tragedy. (629) He had seen for some time that his employer had been ill at ease, and he thought that Hanley breathed a sigh of relief when the others were gone. (616) At first Hanley had been aided by two assistants, but in time the business grew so automatic, and so relatively unimportant to its owner, that Morely directed him to do without any clerks. (582) He spent the time running down the history and official record of the Kirven murder case, a crime which had been committed some ten months previously. (571) He had been in his office about an hour when three men, who introduced themselves as Detective Sergeant Elm, Detective Mosher and Medical Examiner Richards called on him. (558) He was watching the detective keenly, and as he watched, he fancied that he saw a certain glance, which might have been a signal, exchanged between him and Marrows. (555) He had not been married and consequently had no direct heirs, but Hanley learned in due time that the estate had been left to a distant cousin. (547)"

(102) Doris closed her eyes and sighed, twisting her bare arms about him in heavenly rapture. (95) Sara had thrown her curly red head back on the pillow, eyes shut tightly, lips thrillingly a-quiver. (93) Sara's lips were perpetually open, whether or not she was talking, laughing or silent, and George was thrilled by her habit of constantly poking a salmon-tinted tongue-tip between the edges of her pearly teeth. (88) A pungent perfume mingled with the crispness of the air as she swayed forward to accept the flame of a match for the cigarette that she placed between her lips and George was agreeably disturbed by the pressure of a warm thigh just above his knee. (80) As she did so, George saw the white surface of a bare back that the decolletage of her gown uncovered to the bend of her hips, and when she swung around to face him he was confronted by a similar expanse of pale skin except for peaked strips of velvet that cupped the softness of her breasts. (79) Her eyes met his for a brief instant, held them, and fell, her lips tightening as the realization came over her that her cheeks flushed crimson.

(1285) Muggs hurried across the room to the window to watch, while Verbeck remained gazing through the crack in the door at the Black Star, who sat down in the armchair and began inspecting the letters on the table. (1265) Even in this moment of pain, Muggs, though claiming no superior power of reasoning, could not help but think what a fool the Black Star had been to tell Verbeck his schemes. (1252) Could it be possible, he asked himself, that some of the Black Star's band had grown suspicious, and would take an active part against him? Had the Black Star, a prisoner in the old Verbeck house, sent out some message from his prison calling for rescue? Verbeck was half afraid he had made some blunder, had overlooked something that would allow the master criminal to turn the tables and emerge victor from the duel of wits. (1198) It seemed that the Black Star grew taller and straighter as he looked at the other man, and Verbeck and Muggs could see his eyes glittering through the black mask. (1175) Verbeck had no orders ready for her, for her number had not been on the list he had found in the Black Star's book. (1122) Despite the Black Star's words, Verbeck had been half of a mind that the master crook was some one known to the city in general as a respectable man, a sort of Jekyll and Hyde. (1117) He waited for a time, as the Black Star had done, then opened the door and walked boldly into the room, nodding his head to the other man in robe and mask, and taking his position at the Black Star's blackboard. (1095) EIGHT o'clock that night found Roger Verbeck in the Black Star's headquarters, the room put in order, and the candles burning. (1075) He wanted just one blow at the Black Star before the police arrived, for the blow that had been given him, and for the misery Verbeck had been caused. (1067) The Black Star struck him even as Muggs had struck the Black Star in his headquarters room, when Roger Verbeck was shot into the pit. (1055) There was fuel in the house, and after they had carried the Black Star in and made him comfortable on a couch, Verbeck built a fire in the large grate in the living room. (1036)"

(1142) Verbeck had spent the afternoon in the business section, purchasing supplies, for he had decided to live in the old Verbeck house with Muggs and Detective Riley, while his campaign against the Black Star was being waged. (1088) It was five days now since the Black Star's robbery of the diamond vault of Jones &amp; Co., a robbery in which he had made Roger Verbeck, his man Muggs, and Detective Riley objects of ridicule. (1086) He could slip away and go for help but while he was gone, Verbeck and Muggs might be moved, and Riley would not know where they had been taken; or the master criminal might leave his headquarters, and the police find an empty nest when they arrived. (1053) Through Verbeck's mind flashed the thought that his abduction and that of Muggs, their visit to the Black Star's headquarters, their knowledge of the crime planned for that night would be of no value unless he could tell afterward where the headquarters was located. (953) Then he would be carried to the taxicab like a bag of meal, and, after a time, deposited with Muggs near home, there to regain consciousness and remember that the Black Star held Detective Riley prisoner, and that he did not know where. (934) He did not dare fire at random again; he did not know but what Muggs had moved, and might receive the bullet intended for the Black Star; he was afraid Verbeck had left the couch. (910) From then until the Black Star raised the curtain and showed Roger Verbeck gagged and lashed to a chair, Detective Riley lost not a word or movement of the master crook. (906) His glance rested first on the glittering eyes of the Black Star, then upon Verbeck and Muggs. (903) And then Detective Riley forgot even Roger Verbeck and his predicament momentarily, as he read the blackboard conversation and realized what the Black Star and his band intended doing that night. (885) Suppose he tried it, and failed? Then the vapor gun would come forth again, he would be rendered unconscious in truth, and left near home with Muggs, and, not having marked the trail, would be unable to lead a squad of police to the Black Star's place. (834) It was known that the Black Star had reorganized his band and established a new headquarters since Roger Verbeck and Muggs had almost destroyed his establishment. (832) He had to rescue Verbeck and Muggs, prevent the theft of the gold, capture the Black Star, and some of his band, if possible.

(368) THIS is the story Ann told me as she lay on the hospital cot, the glory of her red-gold hair spread like a living flame on the coarse white pillow, her glowing green eyes staring straight ahead at the gray walls, and her pale, curiously beautiful face transfixed with the new spiritual glow in the woman herself. (342) And so, when other women would tell me of their regard for him women whose children he had saved, who had perhaps been saved from death by him  I would smile, replying to their praise of him with forced words of enthusiasm, with all the time jealousy tearing at my heart. (297) I gave my frilled silk coat with its French rosebuds to the young mother in the next room, whose husband came to see her every night.

(264) She went to sleep at last, but I lay there awake and heard the clock strike twelve, then one, and two, and three, and four, no nearer to a decision what to do than when she first told me the story. (253) He confesses that he likes dancing, and dances a great deal, that his regulation attire consists of patent leather oxfords, navy blue suit, black tie, and white shirt; that the comedies that made him famous were made in two or three days for each picture, one picture following another without interruption. (250) When I first came to New York I thought it was wonderful to have money of my own, and a room of my own and a home of my own. (244) There was a gray light coming in through the barred windows before I went to sleep, and it didn't seem as if I'd dozed ten minutes when I felt the nurse shaking me and telling me to drink the slush she called coffee. (241) Dizzy, more than half drunk with the stuff she'd been compelled to drink, she had to put on her coat and hat, and then the men, half dragged, half carried her out of the room, making her walk down the corridor with Pete's hand over her mouth. (240) Lack of funds for the first few years kept me within a limit of decency as to doing much around town, but I still dreamed and went about observing and growing in determination some day to break into the giddy whirl of the night life. (239) I guess he loved me, though, for no matter how often he threatened to quit me, he always came back and would be so kind and loving it made it harder for me to refuse every time. (238) I tried to be nice to the camera men, to the electricians, to the workmen about the place, and I felt that they liked me, for they always greeted me with a nod, and they never grumbled at being ordered to rebuild one of my sets though I had heard them swear at being asked to make over a room or a garden for Gloria Mundi. (238) I'd heard of this place from Liz Dobson, who took too much dope once and had been taken here for a cure, so I knew what I was in for; but nothing seemed to matter to me then I just wished I was dead.

(611) The result was a period of unconsciousness lasting some time, which frightened her mother into a spasm and left Anna with a twenty-four-hour headache and a feeling as if she had been doing hard manual labor without rest.

The answer came in terms of work, work and study, kindness to people who, all along the beach, sought her out in times of sickness. (757) These last three, coming in a batch of tenderness and outpouring laughter and sentiment mixed in the bright concoction that was Johnny Lamb himself, came also too late to bring their recipient to that stage of appreciation for their author to which she might have been stirred if she had received them even the night before the armistice. (714) Hatty did not get Miss Tracy's job at once, but the first time she held it for almost a week before a Miss Silverstein came to grace Morningfield, Carew & McCullough with the glittering and brand new array of commercial armament she had just purchased with fifty dollars and a few weeks' attendance at a business college. (667) ""Karen, they pushed us here, they pushed us into hell! My mother, what did she give me? Weakness and a dreamer's brain filled with taunting visions! God in Heaven, what have I not wanted to -do!"" He turned away, his thin hand clutching his throat, his saintlike face filled with memories of the beauties of the world which he had been allowed but to glimpse, not possess. (643) Freakish as had been its beginning, both ability and importance grew together, nor abated on that great day in November when Hatty, in company with an office of enraptured men and women, again destroyed great quantities of bond paper, legal size, cutting the white sheets into small pieces, and giving her assistance to the creation of that impromptu snowstorm which, on Armistice Day, whirled through the canyons of lower Manhattan from thousands upon thousands of windows. (617) Almost everyone in the office at some time or other had become familiar with the address, but in that tense instant it must have been as crystalline to Hatty as a Chaldean mud tablet. (610) But fortunately he knew nothing of the fact that the picture of Corporal John Raleigh Lamb shared an unimportant place on her dresser behind a can of powder, a vanity case, and a jar of cold cream, with three other youths in khaki, her cousins and Freddy Mawser, whom she had always known without ever having been elated to any pitch of fervor by it. (588) I even came to like Cresson again because he let her win, because he loved her as crazily, after two years, as he had loved her in the first mad days, because not even Marcia's eyes could find a hint of waning infatuation in his attitude. (569) She saw him the next day when he came to say good-by to his friends in the office; but almost shame-facedly he avoided her; the incurable and genuine shyness that was characteristic of Johnny Lamb having, in the meantime, visualized all manner of indignations in the mind of Hatty, which that highly sophisticated young Gothamite certainly never felt. (566) He had been the same sunshiny Chubby in camp and in France that he had been in the office of Morningfield, Carew & McCullough, and in that big, shy, sunshiny heart of his he still carried one picture the vision of Hatty Weller, forever vitalized by the kiss he had given her in the discreet and cemetery-like somnolence of Harlem at 1:15 A. (531) He was out of bed on the instant, a ludicrous figure, had there been but time in that trying moment to notice it, his brown feet padding along the bare floor in vivid contrast to the coarse white nightgown that hung above them at a ridiculous angle. (525) Holling brooded aloud, with an inflection in his voice, however, that was the first appeal that had ever been made to Hatty's intellectual discretion. (520) That I promise!"" Karen's eyes showed great surprise and pity when her mother teetered to her, and standing on tiptoe, pressed her flabby cheek against the girl's glowing face. (502) And I, after I had seen for myself that there was that in Porter Cresson which made a woman's heart quicken at the sight of him, brought him to Marcia  Marcia, the star-woman, fatuously cocksure that no woman of six-and-thirty need fear an overgrown bear-boy, twelve years younger by the calendar and twelve hundred centuries younger in that age of the soul that is understanding.

(815) Wade in a bathing suit! Wade, happy and swimming and young! The Wade who had kissed her and awakened her heart to love! Shivering again in memory of that moment's wild ecstasy, Kathy looked up to find Wade staring down at her, and her cheeks crimsoned in angry self-consciousness. (797) When Sophia opened her eyes again, she felt Linden's gaze upon her and saw in the dark depths of his fine eyes that warm, gentle thing that had gone so straight to her heart and held it once before. (762) Stephen held her off and looked at her, his heart pounding at the thought of her great love for him, until a suspicion of tears dimmed his eyes, and he swallowed painfully. (734) She had supposed all along she had been in love with Vincent Nelson, and yet it took only the nearness of Linden since that first evening to set her very blood on fire, to start a thousand wistful dreams in her heart. (705) If Perplexed will tell her friend to find out what can be done, perhaps he can take a course of some kind that will enable him to work without using his feet all the time, and it will also give him a chance to prove his love for her. (703) of cooking, and there were worn places in the carpet, and the janitor had forgotten the ceiling lights when he cleaned, but Wade Duncannon wasn't thinking of the hall nor the carpet nor the ceiling lights, and Kathy knew it, and her heart ached with pity at the thing she saw in his eyes. (702) Sophia knew that even though Linden had not looked at her once, not met her eyes for even an instant, the two men had been talking about her. (694) gasped, looking desperately about for help, ""my uncle Jerry will pay you any amount! My uncle or my fiance would do that,"" she continued, her tawny-brown eyes flashing furiously, ""but I wouldn't!"" She took one hand from the wheel, to snap her fingers under the man's nose. (655) ""I love you! I love you! I don't hate you! I love you! You can't die! You can't! See, my arms about you-they'll hold you fast! I don't care if all the world finds me here! I want them to! I didn't take that money. (649) Dear Miss Morris: Is there any one who would care to write to a sick young boy who has been in the hospital for almost two years? It would make me so happy to have some Pals to write to, and I know that receiving letters would please me more than anything else I can think of. (647) Where his face had been, an instant before, parched and burning dry, suddenly, beneath Kathy's desperate touch, it was wet and cool, and his eyes had closed in an exhausted, painless sleep. (639) THE STORY SO FAR: Sophia Ambler thought herself in love with Vincent Nelson until he introduces her to Rhoda Kinsella and informs her that Rhoda is the good type of girl he intends to marry. (637) She felt as if it must have been some other girl who had rushed madly out in the night to try to rescue Arnold Cranston and had only succeeded in getting herself dragged into difficulty. (617) Dell found out that either Martin French had been lying to his friends about his admiration for girls who would not allow themselves to be kissed, or else he reserved that admiration for girls in his own walk of life.

""As though he would ever want to kiss me again after kissing her!"" she thought miserably. (780) But it was a pair of steady gray eyes that measured the distance from rail to cartwheel; a brave heart that shut her mind to the consequences if she failed and opened it deliberately to the situation below, in time to hear Slim rasp out: ""And I tell you, you got just thirty seconds to produce that girl. (760) In quick answer to Phil's gaze, Dawn swung to see the door beside which they sat, open, and through it came a tall woman, with fair, pale hair and huge gray eyes. (707) Big arms swept about her suddenly and firm lips came down upon hers and Barbara knew that never in all her gay, spoilt life had Adela Ash been kissed like that. (618) Adela Ash, heiress to goodness only knew how many millions, and accustomed to the most exclusive hunt parties in America, being likened to a rodeo queen! She had laughed until Bill's brown face had become one enormous blush, and then she had dug her heels into Sorcerer's sides so that he had gone off down the trail like the wild streak of lightning he was, and Bill had been hard put to catch her. (615) ""I won't be afraid of anything as long as I have you."" Janine, looking up into his eyes, shivered with happiness as his arms closed about her and his lips crushed down on hers, hot and fierce, in a kiss which made their very souls one forever.

(610) I'm a girl twenty-one years of age, have brown hair and eyes, and some of my friends tell me I look like a famous movie star. (593) In the days that followed, when she dived into the trunk for this possession or that and exposed the lovely things, Lizette only looked knowing, so Janine guessed that her roommate had been through the trunk, but she didn't care. (587) He seemed to have unlimited funds, and Janine grimly pushed the thought of their source into the back of her mind, along with the other self who had once been safe in Beverly. (582) Kill Jack! And, with a frightened sob and a wild, crazy sweep of her arm, Dawn grabbed the first thing her frightened fingers could touch the huge blue bowl, with its heavy freight of flowers and water, and sent it careening madly toward the floor and Poke's feet. (571) Wouldn't Anne laugh to hear Buddy proposing that Janine Broun have a blind date with a gangster named the ""Silver Duke""? Certainly she had hidden Janine well under the ""Jimmy Brown"" that Swantown knew. (548) ""Buddy Draconi asked him to take me for a ride on the water to cool off,"" Janine stammered, because Lizette's eyes looked so knowing. (546) The first time I went out with him was because I was so discouraged about the other boy, but gradually we began going out three and four times a week. (540) Dear Miss Morris: I'm a friendly girl of twenty-one, with dark hair and eyes, fond of dancing, travel, and swimming.

(622) The words came from Honey's opened door, and hearing them, Pitt's voice dribbled off into a half-muttered sneer; swinging to follow his startled eyes, Bobbie found her own angry denial, stilled on, her tongue.

But her voice lacked warmth; her eyes did not glow as Rosalie Benoit's blue eyes glowed when she looked upon Pietro. (140) Eddie doffed his thinking cap for the time being, stepped into a cafe for an absinthe frappe. It was six-thirty when he returned to the lobby of the Vendome, slumped down in a chair behind a potted palm, kept his eyes glued on the elevators. (120) He moved his palm over her face, feeling her slim straight nose, her lips, the soft line of her chin and looked into Salvatia's wide, burning eyes. (119) But even though Sammy's blue eyes had blazed, even though his breath had gone short in his throat that lovely dance had not made him forget that she was, after all, a gypsy girl and therefore a social caste beneath the other members of the circus. (109) ""Rosalie really loves Pietro even though she is ashamed of loving a gypsy"" And Salvatia knew as Pietro gazed at her that he was mentally comparing her coolness with Rosalie's warm emotions; that he was weighing them both, one against the other, and that he was finding her, Salvatia, lacking. (108) Pietro looked down into her slim, dark face, his black eyes burning over that soft beauty. (106) And then suddenly Salvatia stopped short, her black eyes wide, her mouth apart and her bosom swelling suddenly with an emotion that was strangely akin to love for it was hate. (104) Eddie, using his body as a shield against the doorman, jerked a leather-covered black-jack from his pocket swung it, tapped the unsuspecting Crown Prince on the back of the head. (103) Pietro was saying, softly, in a hurt voice, ""Salvatia does not love me, Rosalie.

Josh Hastings' tone was elaborately careless as he put this question, but his eyes were alert as he studied Kay's expression to try to discover whether or not Scrap Johnson had told her what his errand to town that day had been. (1191) The game went on, and as it progressed Link's eyes grew colder and colder, while his face took on that peculiar hawkish ruthlessness that Loma Carlyle had so often noted. (1089) The Sandersons whirled their horses and rode away, but Link, before he left, looked directly into Loma's wide eyes, bowed, tipped his hat and smiled. (1039) She clutched the thought avidly, hungrily, and her lips parted in strange ecstasy as she looked through wide, glorified eyes across the night to where Link Sanderson lay sleeping. (923) Besides that, I'm convinced they've been lootin' the Bar C 88 ever since Bert Mannering died."" And Link proceeded to tell his father his and Loma's suspicions.

(884) Link's eyes seemed to flame in the darkness, and their contact sent Loma's heart to thudding. (872) On the morning of the second day after Loma's meeting with Link, a rider came cantering up to the place, bearing a message from Judge Reynolds that all the necessary legal papers were drawn up and in readiness for her signature. (871) And when Colinga's reptilian eyes flickered and opened, and he made his first effort towards freedom, Loma saw that her work was good. (869) The girl clutched the sagging wooden frame of the door, her brown eyes wide, and her dark hair in sharp contrast to her face, which showed up without an ounce of color in her startled surprise of the moment. (835) Over him stood the wide-shouldered figure of Link Sanderson, his face a cold, relentless mask, his eyes narrow and gleaming. (831) Perhaps a mile had been covered in this fashion when, out of the timber to the east, a rider came loping; he was heading at such an angle as to cut off Link's progress. (813) Loma roused from her period of thought to find Coburn staring at her fixedly, and there was a leer in his eyes that sent the hot color sweeping up her throat. (802) ""Link, maybe you think I'm crazy, but I thought you should know immediately."" Then she went on to tell of the arrival of Texas Jack at the Bar C 88 and of what she had overheard between him and Deuce Coburn.

(941) Fred Temple, whose pale blue eyes had been admiring Jean Carvel's pretty face and slim person, pushed himself into the talk. (885) OLDISH Andy Partle, who was Roane Brandon's partner on a small cattle ranch, was frequently heard to declare that his young partner had been born a few decades too late. (884) Jean Carvel was waiting by the wagon, and Roane pulled up to talk to her, while Andy arranged his mount and pack horse to keep their escort of four men back out of earshot. (883) Roane's black-and-tan hound, which he had left at the Gary ranch when he had taken Dan Carvel there, came from the ranch house to greet his master with his usual single deep bark. (857) Young Tom Gary, for the first time since he had been carried to Jean Carvel's camp, was pronounced out of danger by his uncle. (845) Roane was anticipating that Threllen and Coulter would try their old tactics if they met too strong opposition: Send part of their force back through the gorge to circle along the rims and jump the Gary ranch on a flank. (783) Silently the whole group of Cross Seven riders watched until wagon and horses were out of sight; Lafe Hake with his loose-lipped smile keeping his small eyes fixed on the girl on the blood-bay. (776) As the outfit went on, with the wagon wheels jolting hard over stones, the girl on the black horse looked after the slim graceful figure of Jean Carvel. (759) The features of his down-bent face were concealed by the wide brim of his hat, but Bill caught the trustfulness of the blue eyes and a wistful tremor of the girl's lips as she smiled up at her companion. (756) Drinking his coffee, Roane Brandon looked with appreciative eyes at the girl as she climbed briskly into the wagon. (743) This must be a ranch of one of the Gary families; and if the Garys were as quick to shoot as the Cross Seven riders, it might be a ticklish matter to ride up to the place. (730) The rider's big hand fell to the six-shooter in his holster, but as the ugly snout of the gun came up, Jean Carvel spurred past the wagon to push the blood-bay in between her father and Threllen. (726) ""The Cross Seven is not selling horses, I tell you,"" snapped Temple when Andy Partle brought up the matter for the third time. (714) ROANE found Andy Partle, Clayton Gary and two neighbors firing from behind a wall of stones loop-holed for their rifles and looking down on the high wire fence in the gorge bottom.

(855) But Ford Harrell and Walt Carmack, for once seeing eye to eye, had perceived how uncomfortable his continued presence made Lucy McAdams, so when the regular chief clerk of the legislature got sick, they managed to get old Lucky Jim Sanderson and Gene Chipman to pull a few political wires that landed the temporary job for the kid. (831) But now for the first time in all his twenty-five years Walt had seen sudden death come to one who was as young and full of life and laughter as himself, one who had been as close as an own brother. (816) For a moment he stood uncertainly inside the door, his hungry gaze searching for a golden head that always caught and held the light, just as it caught and held his heart! Searching also for the lovely, animated face with gold-lashed blue eyes and long, laughing lips. (790) ""I didn't think those pink letters you've been getting lately were bills for whiskey! I'd have headed it off all right if I hadn't found out how nice she is."" She paused a moment and a smile came into her eyes. (759) Walt unsaddled his sweat-caked and weary horse and turned him in the corral, then went up to the house and pushed open the door of the study. (734) With hands that were quick and steady in spite of the sick, shaky feeling down inside him, Walt tied one end of a lariat securely to his saddle horn, then went over the edge, hand over hand down the rope. (698) During Harrell's absence some of the ranch management had naturally gravitated into Walt Carmack's hands, and it hadn't helped the foreman's temper any, on those Sundays when he came home, to find that things on the ranch rocked along on a pretty even keel without him. (697) Walt wrote them all down in a little black notebook and by the time he turned into his own front yard a little after midnight Friday, he had something over fifty thousand dollars pledged, with the chance of another fifteen or twenty thousand coming from the letters he had written to ranchers who lived too far away to reach in one day's horseback circuit. (692) Why couldn't he have been attracted by some sensible ranch girl instead of that two-faced Docie Mitchell? He still loved her even her silly little footprint in the mud and Puck knew him well enough to be sure he'd never look at another woman. (689) There was surprise in his face for a moment, then as he turned his head toward her, even in the moonlight Lucy could see the terror grow in his eyes. (684) When she inquired further in Cosecha she learned that Walt wasn't in town, and, as far as anyone knew, he hadn't been for a couple of days. (677) Walt Carmack had been gone for three weeks and no one, not even his mother, had heard from his since he'd left. (672) Near the head of this little used trail, Walt retied his horse to one side, out of sight in a clump of trees, and took his stance behind a big rock. (663) It was an uncanny shill with which he'd been born, and there came a time when Kent Bradford would have given the whole world to be without it. (647) The man took the lantern, went over and examined the dead Harper, then shook his head and turned to Kent. (643)"

He laughed wildly then turned sharply to the girl, ""this is no place for a woman, Rhoda, you must go.

(687) When Rhoda was dressed she glanced into the long mirror and knew that she had never in her life looked more attractive; her face was vivid with color, her blue eyes unnaturally bright.

(623) Half a block from his house he saw the light from the front room glowing across the sidewalk, and knew his wife was waiting for him, that little Marie would be expecting some candy, and after giving him a big ""yug"" as she called it, would begin searching his pockets, a game they played when he reached home before she went to bed; which, of late, had not been often, he remembered. (602) At last the train pulled in at Rhoda's station; the little cars jerked to a stop and the girl leaned eagerly out of the window to catch a first glimpse of her father. (599) How dark the shadows were under her blue eyes! For a moment the desire to take her in his arms, to feel again the sweetness of her close against his heart, stirred the man's every sense; but she did not love him she was going to marry Townsend. (581) The ayah squatting at her feet, sensing the girl's thoughts of love, murmured a charm that the eyes of the Captain sahib might be pleased with the work of Hokigan's hands. (571) For a moment despair seized Goring  exhausted and unarmed, he took hold of the side of the drifting boat and looked to where he knew the girl now was safe. (560) James Montgomery Flagg once again takes his brush ""in hand"" to paint the cover for Saucy Stories this month this time he gives us his ideal of Florence Dixon, of whom it is said, ""She is the most photographed girl in America,"" and probably you have by this time met Miss Dixon on the screen, as she was starred in one of the latest James Montgomery Flagg Comedies that Paramount are releasing, titled, ""Independence B'Gosh!"" Remember? She had the part of maid to Sara, wife of Horatio Whiffle and was also sweetheart of Horatio's man, Sam (Olin Howland). (552) Raxter : A life time for hit! Seems like a miracle, you're marrying me, May! You could have picked the best of us, and you took me! I can't figure hit out, unless hit's because I love you with a love that's just reached for you ever since I first set eyes on you five years ago. (547) Rhoda looked off toward the living-room, where, under the shaded light, she could see the boy's mother and father, face to face at the small card-table. (544) The girl beside him tried to follow what was being said: she heard her father's name, but though she could not understand intiutively she knew that whatever word had come was not good. (529) The excitement, the fatigue attendant on her struggle and her fear of this swearing, angry beast almost upon her, made the girl for the first time in her life faint dead away. (528)"

And she would almost have hurled back his bargain into his mean eyes, had she not caught the suspicion of Wally's glance. (546) Clayton told him what had happened that afternoon, including the clue he believed he had found, in the description of the tea which the Girl in Gray had been given. (530) Then Alicia asked the man to get Nick Brewster's pretentious place, nestling under the mountain at the other end of the valley, and in due time Doris Brewster's voice came clearly through the ether. (528) Alice went home to her boarding-house and cried herself to sleep on the bed, but at six o'clock Hal Ross came to take her to dinner and for the first time in her life perhaps she was glad to see a man and showed it. (502) At her door she left him with lowered eyes and only a faint ""Good-by,"" so that he left her house happier than he had ever been in his life. (492) He had slipped, for the time being, from the proper John Harlan Margery knew into the wild Jack Harlan who used to wait at the New Amsterdam stage-door for Peggy. (443) ""Why, has anything been the matter with you, John?"" Margery asked at once, looking into his flushed face closely. (443) When Clayton crossed over to help Moore install their private telephone, he found him waiting at the front door of the house. (441) But Harlan quickly brought it back to normalcy by assuring it that there was no room in his present scheme of things for girls   especially very pretty girls with creamy skin and large blue eyes and golden hair as smooth as velvet, like Margery's. (440) ""If you marry old Anton, you'll be his! You'll belong to him! Do you want his old hands to pet you? He ain't got no right to such a dainty young girl! Wally, now he's clean! He's young! He's full of the devil, p'raps, but his eyes are bright and his mouth ain't so experienced. (440) A great deal relieved, Clayton returned to the front hall, stationed Larry in the alcove there, and made his way to Vining's desk in the front room. (426) Then, just when he faced the darkest hour, when he seemed unable to work or play because of this girl, Sutherland came across Alice's letter, almost two years old now, at the bottom of his trunk. (419) Presently Alice found herself in Maurice's arms, his eyes on her face, his voice low and tense in her ear. (418) ""Didn't what?"" asked Van Horn casually, looking him full in the face with a glint of amusement in his eyes. (418) To the ripple of amusement, Nita's cheeks stained pink and her eyes, which had been appealing, now turned darkly defiant. (404) The door was open into his bedroom beyond and the first thing Clayton noticed was a lot of telephone wire, lying on the floor. (401)"

(773) Guardedly it theorized; more boldly it alluded to the obvious necessity of the arrest, recounting the fact that the vietim had been found dead five minutes after the departure of the prisoner and that no one apparently had entered the private office in the interim; but the general tendency of all the newspapers was to ""play up"" the mystery, since the standing of the accused a junior member of the old and distinguished banking house of Gardener Brothers  was so unimpeachable that, in the absence of motive and as yet no motive had been ascertained it was almost inconceivable that he should be guilty. (695) She had been busy down town before marriage, and her mother, who didn't like to cook either, had said ""Ethyl will learn like we all do, when the time comes."" So Ethyl was learning now, using Andrew's money for experiments and the results were not all he hoped for. (669) No longer will the policeman stay me, But the thousand others, From crossing the Avenue; Nor will the porters see only Three bags and a box And hopes of a quarter When I tell them that last night, By the black water, By the dark blue water, Under a tree that bent over us As trees bend over lovers In the meadows of heaven, Your hands learned my face And your mouth my mouth, And afire with a new knowledge Our eyes shone through the darkness Like four stars. (661) And when he had consumed it he perused his experience, turning over again in his mind each detail of the cabs he had seen; and from that his thoughts slipped calmly to the glorious history of China, going back to the indecorous times before calmness came, and beyond those times to the happy days of the earth when the gods and dragons were here and China was young; and lighting his opium pipe and casting his thoughts easily forward he looked to the time when the dragons shall come again. (650) If he had remained single, Andrew thought that he still might have been a part of real city life as he saw it. (648) Close to this young girl in the charmed prison of her arms, a mystical understanding seemed to reveal itself, a law of life about to be fulfilled, that assured him at last a compensation, a weighing in the other side of the scales, earned pleasure for pain. (636) THE GIRL I went to the councillors, and I stood before their great council tables where they pondered their affairs of state, and I told them the magic of play, and the truths of unbelievable things, of the prayers in children's gestures, and the wisdom in old women's eyes. (635) It might have been a frequency of engagements Ethyl had had with other men, ""A boy I went to school with"" or ""Mr. (627) to the electric chair simply because he had been alone in an office with a man who was found dead five minutes later, and with no more impelling motive than his being in love with the man's wife and about to be separated from her. (617) When the news spread through the city that for no apparent reason the son of Valdivieso had insulted both the daughter and wife of Perez in public, and that young Valdivieso had been taken off to jail, there was quite naturally an intense interest on the part of everybody, an eager expectancy. (615) Sitting near his window, looking out at the street, he thought of the calm hours of only a few weeks past, when the uncertainty of his future had seemingly departed, when, for the first time, life, his opponent, appeared to throw down its plainly read cards upon the table. (606) Hadn't he suspected, from the first? Only today, at noon, he had told himself that Ethyl had been born in New York, that she must be bad. (606) So, at the Rayolds' party, when, after fifteen minutes, we were well beyond the first stages of getting acquainted, and I could see the weeks stretch out, our weeks, it came to me that I was dead had been for a long time. (602) Such a marriage! Yet hadn't he married a city woman? Well now he knew the worst this was the way out and now Andrew knew that it was the way out he had been looking for all along. (597) So, when Lilligore offered to prove, if given the chance, that even more mysterious crimes though less serious had been committed in the Holland, Delray &amp; Dallas offices since the murder, he took the view that such evidence would in all likelihood be all that was necessary to throw the balance to the side of acquittal.

(704) Ennis' eyes fastened on a small, slender girl widi chestnut hair who walked at the end of the line, a girl in a straight tan dress, whose face was white, stiff, like those of the others. (697) He rolled over, dashed the young American to the floor, and leaped up, his dark face and great black eyes blazing. (646) The old man was hatless, and his long white hair lent his face an air of benevolence, but nothing concealed the aura of diabolic evil about him the crimson scar edged in blue and gray, the twisted mouth, the fierce, black eyes, loathsome and gloating. (626) He had risen to his feet, a tall, blond young American whose good-looking face was drawn and worn by inward agony, whose crisp yellow hair was brushed back from his forehead in disorder, and whose blue eyes were haunted with an anguished dread. (605) To Eric she turned a look that was an open caress, leaning toward him, putting a hand on his arm, as he stood beside his chair, stern-lipped, with eyes that would not look at John's hurt bewilderment. (593) Hastily Ennis jerked the gray robe and hood from Chandra Dass' dead body and donned it, while Campbell struggled into one of the others. (577) Ennis saw that the inspector's sagging face was expressionless, and knew that behind that colorless mask, Campbell's brain was racing in an attempt to find a method of escape. (569) Clinging to the girl, Ennis fought like a madman through a darkness in which none could distinguish friend or foe, toward the door at the side from whidi Campbell had fired. (554) AT TWO in the morning, two hours and a half after the odd seizure of Mathew Weems, and while Gest and Kroner and Chichester were in Doctor Grays' suite anxiously looking at the stricken man, eight people were in the sleek, small roulette room of the Blue Bay Hotel on the fourteenth floor. (553) Ennis' dazed eyes lifted from the blazing badge to the Hindoo's dark face. (552) ""What do they do with them?"" Inspector campbell's bright brown eyes showed a hint of hooded horror, yet he shook his head. (536) A long face with pointed black beard, proud curving nose, and eyes dark and secret as forest pools gleamed beneath the hood. (528) Ennis saw Campbell's gray figure slipping round to the side door. (522) Campbell and Ennis reached the end in time to see a long, powerful, gray motor-boat dash out into the black obscurity of the river, and roar eastward with gathering speed. (517) ""She is obstinate, as all women are obstinate."" The sheykh's lean hands were hidden by flowing sleeves, to Dale's disgust; but a muscle twitched above the high cheek-bone, and the dark fire of his eyes glowed red. (514)"

(801) Conan glanced back as he went out the door, at that shambles where the dead lay on the smoldering floor, blood-stained dark limbs knotted in attitudes of fierce muscular effort, dark faces frozen in masks of hate, glassy eyes glaring up at the green fire-jewels which bathed the ghastly scene in a dusky emerald witch-light. (769) I went over in my mind the tales de Lacy had told me of the havoc she had caused; how one man had cast himself down from the highest turret, crying her name; how another had been found dead in the rose garden, horror frozen on his face.

His eyes were vivid, shining brightly in his pale face. (677) Now, as though at a silent command, a girl left the group and began to mount the stairs, as those motionless three must have mounted! Vivacious Ann she had been the life of Cliff's yacht party; but now she was changed. (637) The night before we landed, we were standing on deck, at the rail, looking over the side straining our eyes for the first glimpse of the lights of Cherbourg, and Wrexler spoke of himself for the first time since we had left New York. (631) For the translucence of his skin made the thick, black hair that lay close to his head all the darker, while at the same time it brought out the deep black of his eyes, and the firm cut of his lips. (630) So when the warped space-curve ceased to be, and Thag's hold upon reality failed, he must have been dropped back out of the dissolving folds upon the spot where the Tree had stood in the space-circled world, through that vanished world-floor into the spot he had been snatched from in the instant of the dim land's dissolution. (620) In that incredible embrace she stood immobile for a long moment, the Tree arching down with all its curling limbs, the girl straining upward, her head thrown back and the mantle of her hair swinging free of her body as she lifted her face to the quivering blossoms. (618) Because as he died he gazed at last into the living stone face of Anubis the living stone face that held his father's tortured eyes. (614) Why he asked himself in a determined groping after steadiness should the mere sight of a tree, even so fabulous a one as this, rouse that insane panic in the gazer? What peril could dwell invisibly in a tree so frightful that the living horror of it could drive a man mad with the very fact of its unseen presence? He clenched his teeth hard and stared resolutely at that terrible beauty in the clearing, fighting down the sick panic that rose in his throat as his eyes forced themselves to dwell upon the Tree. (612) Now as von Hartmann, overwhelmed by the many strange things which had occurred to him that day, passed his hand over his forehead and cast his eyes downward, he chanced to catch the reflection of his own face in a pool which the rain had left upon the road.

(587) Men of ancient Persia, clad in leather kirtles and rusted armor, and they were hideous! In the yellow moon-glow Cliff could see them clearly now a lookout standing motionless in the stem, the steersman on the poop-deck, the drummer squatting beside the broken mast, the rowers in the pit and all, all were a bloodless white, the skin of their faces puffed and bloated and horribly wrinkled, like flesh that had been under water a long time.

But, even as realization brought a twinge of the old awe of royalty to penetrate his unlawful impulses, the thought came to Rald that, after all, this was a woman, a beautiful and brave woman, and one to be desired even if she was the Lady Thrine, sister to the King of Forthe. (722) Standing on the wet sands, the cool winds caressing her, the lovely face turned dreamily toward the stars, stood the glamorous daughter of the ages, a dark-eyed Princess from the mists of time, whose tiny feet had trod the great halls of the Pharaohs. (604) Another man came into view a Martian, seven feet tall, huge-chested, with arms and legs thin as pipe-stems, his round face, with its tiny mouth and bulging eyes, like some ludicrous mask. (546) Rald was amazed to see the room beyond lit by three great torches stuck at intervals along the walls; so closely had the portals been fitted that not a single ray of light escaped their edges, and his abrupt transition from moonbeams to fire-light left him momentarily in blinking uncertainty.

(512) He saw the Raider's face, astonishment in the black eyes, saw light-tube and ray-tube drop from the pirate's hands. (503) An omniscience of the past hovered over those ragged skylines; a susceptible observer might have imagined the flickering spirits of bygone kings floating to and fro among the crumbling turrets, guarding the castle walls and casting watchful eyes over the mansions and huts of the surrounding countryside; ghosts watching over Thrall, the last king of the Ebon Dynasty a king with no heir to carry on the ancient line.

Has the high king who reigns in dim Kadath Called back his courtly, sage embassador?

(495) Kenworth began to search the room with his eyes, methodically seeking several devices which he knew should be in the control chamber. (486) It felt inordinately heavy in his hands, surprizingly heavy for a piece of metal hardly thicker than the sword he swung so lightly; his heart, which had been pulsing in faster tempo for the moment, only regained its normal rate when he stood the forbidden barrier softly against the farther wall.

Exiles learn to suspect every change of light and shadow, and Nikakova and I spent a night of terror, starting at each footstep in the alley, almost fainting every time a creak came at our lockless door for fear it might be officers of the gendarmerie come to take us for affording shelter to a fugitive. (588) I was wondering, indeed, why she was not by this time on her feet and making one of their queer little bobbing bows 'cockroach bow to fowl,' as they might say! It seemed this old woman must have fallen into a very deep sleep, for she had not moved at all, although ordinarily she would have heard me, for the night was deathly still, and their hearing is extraordinarily acute, like a cat's, or a dog's.

(456) I waked last night to see the key glowing with a lurid greenish radiance that same morbid green which I have seen in the eyes and skin of certain portraits here, on the shocking lock and key, on the monstrous menhirs of the hill, and in a thousand other recesses of my consciousness. (451) The room was as it had been, Tony sat against the farther wall, just as when I had last seen him, except that his head was dropped forward as a man's asleep. (444) Her eyes were utterly unfocussed, she seemed unable to do more than tell the difference of light and shade, when we spoke to her she gave no answer; the only sounds she made were little whimpering noises, not cries of pain or fear, but merely the mechanical responses of vocal cords reacting to the breath.

(766) convulsion that Dmitri had instilled in Mary Roberts' subconscious, the cruel weapon he had implanted within the core of her being and goaded, in terror-ridden desperation, into life, had died in the instant her subconscious became aware of Dmitri's passing, had ceased as abruptly as though a circuit had been broken, as completely as though an evil light had been extinguished. (607) I'd seen the place as I drove past, and had often wondered why it was unoccupied, for it stood up on a hill surrounded by tall trees and would have made an ideal summer home, but I'd been told its well was dry, and as there was no other source of water, nobody wanted it. (548) But the knots we tied must have been loose, or else the weights were insufficient, for as we turned to leave, her body floated almost to the surface and one white arm raised above the river's glassy face, as though to wave a mute farewell. (534) It must have been a trick the current played as the tide bore her away, but to us it seemed that her dead hand pointed to us each in turn; certainly there was no doubt it bobbed four times above the river's surface before the swirling waters sucked it out of sight. (531) Doctor Barnard, who had been watching the patient, thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality, and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening, as if of intelligent determination. (529) ""A long-drawn sigh came from the audience; then the tableau was abruptly broken as the girl turned from us, mounted nimbly to the black-draped altar and stretched herself full length upon it, crossed her ankles and thrust her arms out right and left, so that her body made a white cross on the sable altar-cloth. (522) lights; even beneath the cold glow of the Mazda lamp they had been a strange symphony, but now, glowing and whirling like a mighty nebula of spinning suns ! Her eyes were riveted upon them; they seemed to draw her toward them, to suck her into themselves. (504) And in Peters' heart there leaped exultation; for in his mind had been, all along, the strange, weird conviction that the end of Dmitri would bring release to those he had enslaved. (498) For a moment she stood there, svelte, graceful, mysteriously beautiful with that thin white face and scarlet lips so like a mask; then with a sudden kicking motion she unshod her feet, opened wide her cloak and let it fall in scarlet billows on the dull-black carpet of the altar steps. (496) DIMLY, while his brain reeled and his soul retched as he gazed upon the ghastly thing on the floor, he yet realized that the same release that had, in the instant of Dmitri's passing, loosed Mary Roberts' nerves and muscles from the death-laden throes of convulsion, had also, and in that same awful instant, freed Stepan's subconscious from the enjoinment that his body was invulnerable to physical injury. (492) He carried Dmitri's small automatic pistol in his right hand, and instinctively Peters' fingers moved, again, toward his hip, then paused helplessly as his mind recalled with sudden sharp vividness the incredible demonstration he had witnessed only a brief hour before. (491) The sum of all my investigation was, that in a kind of semi-corporeal dream-life Slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys, meadows, gardens, cities, and palaces of light, in a region unbounded and unknown to man; that there he was no peasant or degenerate, but a creature of importance and vivid life, moving proudly and dominantly, and checked only by a certain deadly enemy, who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure, and who did not appear to be of human shape, since Slater never referred to it as a man, or as aught save a thing. (485) From the general discussion that followed, the artist learned that the dead man, who for a good part of his life had been a shepherd in the Alban Hills, was a strange dreamer of a fellow who claimed to have the gift of second sight, to be able to foretell the future, and to have the power to cure disease by prayer. (479) ""Herbules began the service with a muttered Latin prayer, and though he seemed to follow a set ritual even I could see it was not that prescribed, by any church, for when he knelt he did so with his back turned toward the altar; when he crossed himself he did it with the thumb of his left hand, and made the sign beginning at the bottom, rather than the top. (470) MARCH had gone, and most of April, when the thing happened that crystallized all my vague apprehensions and shattered the routine of our life at camp  that started the dread avalanche that did not end until all the world had been overwhelmed in horror.

He could hear the blood pounding in his ears and everything was beating rhythmically to the tune of the tap-tap-tap, and words came and kept time with the music in his ears, and he heard her say again and again, ""You have to kill yourself you have to kill yourself tap-tap-tappity-tap-tap you have to kill yourself."" Little white drops of sweat came out on his face, and slowly, very slowly, he reached for the dagger and with clenched hand did the thing he had to do.

(647) Two men at arms went down, one gasping with sick anguish as de Grandin's boot heel caught him in the stomach, another with a bloody mouth where a small fist had mashed his lips against his teeth, but the struggle was unequal, and within a minute they had laid him with his face against the floor, hands bound behind him, clothes gaping in a dozen places, but cursing with such poisonous bitterness that at last a guardsman stuffed a knot of rushes in his mouth. (623) She stroked his hair, and she dropped a kiss on his hair and she whispered that she was sorry that he was going to do what he was going to do because they might have been happy if things had been different, and now he should listen to her little heels tap-tap-tapping out of the room and out of his life because he was going to take the dagger and kill himself and he could not keep from doing it if he kept looking at the candles and thinking of Lilith Lamereaux and the past years when he might have been happy if he had been different.

(539) The children of Dagon came sweeping in a resistless rush, cold eyes glazed and glaring, tentacles questing, iridescent bodies shifting and pulsing like jelly and Elak and Lycon and the girl, Coryllis, were caught by their fearful wave and forced back, up the staircase. (530) Neither did he like the newspaper men and cameramen who came to Wilson Hall's house to get stories about the winged man's accident; but these soon ceased coming, for David Rand was not now the sensation he had been years ago. (524) For some time the doctor's heart had troubled him, and there came a morning when he did not awaken, and when a dazed, uncomprehending David stared down at his guardian's still white face. (519) Also, his dreams had been most pleasant: of the gay court at Toulouse, of song contests and knightly jousts and tournaments and fair women with pale hands; and through, them all, mingling with the happy visions of the times long lost, there ran the figure of a lissome damozel with night-black hair and moss-green eyes that brightened sometimes with the flashing fire of opals. (497) Across the table the woman dead a hundred years looked at him, and it seemed that she smiled and urged him to be a man at last and not be afraid, because it was not such a hard thing to be dead, if there was love, even a dead love in your life. (495) David settled down there for a time, sleeping upon the porch, making long flights for amusement, west over the villages and dingy cities, north over the rugged, wave-dashed coast, east over the blue sea; until at last the flowers began to die and the air grew frosty, and the deep urge tugged at David until again he joined the great flocks of winged things going south. (495) He only knew her eyes shone greenly, like a cat's at night, whenever a stray beam of moonlight pierced the little cavern of her camail, and when they rested on him in calm speculation he felt small ripples of swift chill run up his neck and through his scalp the eery warning feeling he had known when, walking in the forest, he had almost trod unwittingly into an adder's den. (467) Of course an ordinary man cannot regenerate a lost arm or leg like that, but your body is not an ordinary one and your wings might possess some power of partial regeneration, for one time at least."" He added, ""You don't need to worry about it, though, David. (458) Deep set, his little round blue eyes might have seemed humorous had it not been for the curiously cold directness of their gaze. (430) The birds shrilled loud and David laughed and sang in joyous chorus as his great wings whirred in time with their own, trailing high across the night sky toward adventure and freedom, flying south.

The Strangest adventure that ever befell a man happened to the handsome young American after the ill-starred traffic accident in the streets of Cairo. (1013) Her eyes, tear-misted, pleading, came up to his beneath their long, curved, golden lashes, her face was white as if she had been dead an hour, and her full lips, so mobile usually, hung limply parted, yearning, slack with longing almost past endurance. (687) He backed away from the trunk, hands to his lips, staring at it with eyes that could not have been more horrible had they seen Martia Opper's bent form rising from it. (681) depths of the trunk that Opper knew that at last it must have been heard by another's ears. (611) Suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever since I first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon, and despite my exhaustion I found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world. (583) When, in the evening of my first day as his daughter, I was sent for by him, I found I had to kneel and press my hands flat to the floor, then lay my brow between them while I intoned formally, ""Es-salaam, ya abu the Salute, O my father."" Not until he had responded, ""Es-salaam, ya bent the Salute on thee, O daughter,"" might I rise, and then I had to stand with folded hands and eyes cast down demurely till he bade me sit upon a cushion at his feet. (561) Though I had been warned of Manuel De Costa, I knew that even without that warning I would have felt the sudden dislike for the polished stranger entering the room; a tall, smirking human, whose swarthy features seemed devoid of any redeeming quality. (545) THE next thing I remember I was lying in the vaulted room where I had first wakened, and the body of the dead girl had been moved so close to me that we were like two people lying in a bed. (534) There was character a-plenty, and to spare, in small, firm chin; the kestrel nose might stand for cruelty or acquisitiveness, but the cleft that marked her chin and the luscious, full, red lips were soft and passionate and made for kissing, while the long, slim, lissome lines of her, the childishly small hands with tapering, fragile fingers, the tiny, narrow, high-arched feet, were almost fairy-like. (526) From the corner of my eye I saw her male companion follow suit, and as his grease-smeared fingers touched the dead girl's wound it seemed miraculously to heal, leaving smooth white skin where there had been a livid, gaping wound a moment before. (523) The tinkle-tonk of anklets sounded in the hall and two young women, one part Arab, the other black as only full-blood Sudanese can be, came in and greeted me with a profound temana, touching the floor, the knees, the heart, the lips and forehead, as they entered. (511) It had been close confinement more rigorous than a prison's, cut off from any contact with the world I'd known, without a single book or newspaper to tell me what went on beyond the harem's boundaries, with no one to talk to but a lot of ignorant and vapid women and an old man who regarded me as Westerners might regard a pet animal. (506) That I might find and aid The Midnight Lady may have been behind it all; though how one man could bring about that rescue in the face of those hundreds of desert warriors was an entirely different matter. (487) The importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast, for they held first place among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and ceiling. (485) Silently, my eyes glued to the doorway, I gathered myself together as a tall figure in a white shirt appeared in the opening, and the cool night air came whistling into the room. (461) An ancient musket had been pointed at my head even as I approached the doorway, while the shouting and gesticulating, together with a wild flow of words, told that the curses of a hundred pagan gods were being called down upon me.
